Streamers! [everyone throws streamers in the air and starts dancing] [goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing? Well, what if you're cold? Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear. [drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration. Wow, that's a lot of keys. That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back. I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope] Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer] What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life. Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us. Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke. Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you? Dwight is about to get so Pammed. Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on. There we go. Let's just calm down. I don't- Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God! Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds! Great. We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic... Is there really? Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea. Aaah! Wait. Is this your place Dwight? Yeah. These are actually forks and knives from the break room. And a soy sauce packet. Don't b*at yourself up. Who will be watching the children? Prove it. Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works. But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good. So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key. The mall itself or just the stores in the mall? Did something happen Dwight? Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board. Dwight? Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the "F" word? No you will not. Ok. So what happened? No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you. Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby. Pretty Woman. No, no. I want to hear you tell it. Agreed. Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching. Yeah, I liked them too. Say stuff like, "Good morning, Good Afternoon". People appreciate that. Please and thank you go a long way. Thank you. Wish us luck! [coughs for attention] My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit] Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it. Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that. Let me know if I can help you with anything. Yes? I remember, yes. I'm terribly sorry about that. We had a safety concern. Um... we very politely indicated that he'd be welcome back... If he were in accordance with our dress policy. But the blood stained hands... I'm very sorry. Lets just go. There it is. Alright. After you. Dwight? Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight. Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe. Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her. No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show. Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause. Do you want to re-mediate? Ooooh! [after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change. Oh, Dwight, just move. Come on, Dwight. These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car. That was more horrifying than Nunsense. Okay. No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted. No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times. Well, I won't tell if you don't. Good night, Dwight. I don't want to talk about it anymore. Hola amigo. Si, yo muy bueno worker. Scranton, y before that La Philadelphia. Yes, I'm really good at English. [quietly] Okay. [seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars? Yeah, I got stung up my dress. Poor hornet. But if he doesn't? Uhh, beg your pardon? No. No no no! [nos coming from all employees] [picks up baseball bat, heads towards hornet's nest]Employees except No! No no! How did this happen, how did I get this? You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. [in pirate voice] It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port. Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her. Oh my God! What if I did? Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her. There's no way I'm gonna do that. [makes grunt in attempt to stop Dwight. Dwight hangs up] Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye! Michael... [Michael hangs up] Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial. Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call. [after long wait, to Dwight] Would you excuse us... Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column. You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She... No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there. Yes, I don't... I know, I know. Got it. Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene? What is happening? [Dwight shushes her] Jerk. [walks off] I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous. Herpes duplex. We were never lovers! Flower shops, fireworks celebrations... Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park... An electric car dealership. [Oscar gets up and starts leaving] She is a beaut! [chanting] Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Ow! [grunts, stumbles to his feet] You never forget. Whoo! Amazing. How do I look? Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go. Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after. He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash. I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining. Phoenix Sun's point guard? No? Nothin'? I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh. Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...[motions to lobby] Crap. Well, by worst, you mean the best. So, the situation is the worst. Ahhh. Okay, great- -I'm just gonna watch. Good to see you too. Oh, I'm just here for the coffee. Dwight! Yes. Yes! Nope, not doing that. And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now. Michael, I'm going with Danny. Thanks, Steve. No, I didn't. Oh, my god! I know how we can learn his tricks. Is that your office? Nope. Different movie. Meredith Van Helsing? Oh, no, no. No. Don't- Yeah, he is that good-looking. I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh? Oh! What do you mean? All right. I can do that. Then what? Yes. Exactly. You can do this. Who else we got? I'm goin 'in! Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well. It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it. Yes. No, you may not. I said no. No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us. Hmpf! Obviously. I don't even think she called me back. Dwight, please. Okay...that's different. Uh...I mean-yeah. Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine? Oh. [turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves] Stop. Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler. What? [laughs] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski? I don't know, they're both handsome. I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now. No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head. What is taking someone from behind? It was a good idea, though. This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book. [staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about? Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right? Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see. Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow] Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick. And get your flu sh*t. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office. Elaborate. I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you. [sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome. Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids. Thank you. Anyone else with a prayer or a remembrance? [Dwight and an eldery man stand up at the same time, Dwight stares at him, man sits back down] Try "Jesus." Hello. It's gonna be three months of hard work and when we're done, we'll practically be Quimixtanos. [overhearing Dwight's conversation] Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey. Are you kidding me? Stop it. Tell them that I'm in a meeting. No, you may not. They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out. Are you going? [to Dwight] I would watch that. [Pam in the background struggling with Cece] Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated. Maybe I should go. If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back. I can't even talk about it. I kind of doubt Gabe has suit. I don't know about, love... [whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes. No no no no no! She'll wake up! Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion? Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And- Absolutely! [starts out] What kind of pizza would you like? No! [runs off] That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me. Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it. Okay... [puts pizza into Dwight's mouth] What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us! You need to stop talking. Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight! [unbelievingly] Okay... No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela. The reverse cycling ends tonight! [Pam leaves] I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in] Nope. No. I'm trying everything. That's-- [ding] the password. We're in. Wow. Awesome. [out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality. Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it "Hay Place". Eldred Called it "Hay World". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it. Don't forget to make a broom. Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay. No, I meant... [motions you and me] Mm-Hmm. Perfect! Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back. Yeah! I wanna go on it again. Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks] Where have you been?! I've been waiting. I found the needle in the haystack! I don't know! Yeah. [Michael closes the door] And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let's hear it for... Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight's worker claps] Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door] Why? Do you mind? You don't have to do that. [whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do. Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong. Well, A for effort right? Eight dollars? Yeah, right here. It is right there. [holds up magazine] Anybody read the news any more? Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply? Don't tell me how to do my business. Which is you. Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks. I'm not going to do that. Sure. [hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends. I don't know what the [expletive] that was. Dwight take it down. I'm serious, take it down or else. I went out to look for a better office space. Yup. Yeah, yeah. Totally. Oh, its on. Well, I wish for a million wishes. Then see you later building. I'm pretty good on politics. "California is bankrupt, and California, California." [Jim and Andy follow Michael into his office] What? I understand it, I can't speak it. You've been watering down the soap? We need everything back the way it was. [riding in car, looking for new office] Ten thousand seven hundred and six. Yeah. The building's underground? Pam. Pam? I'm Pam. No you're not. Oh, that's fine. I've been known to bend the truth. Okay. I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam. Yeah? I know, because you're the reason we're moving. Uhh, I think it's something like umm... Umm, let me see. Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet. Hello, hello. You're breaking the law. Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper. I don't think it goes that way. That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole... You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping? I am jumping. Yes, I'm jumping. Oh God. Hey, it's snowing. [Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs] Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right? Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs] You've got something on your nose. No. That sounds awesome. Can we all do it? Pam? Pam? Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby! I don't know. You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree. [standing outside, dials Dwight's cell phone] [voicemail recording] You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.] Stop! Stop! Oh... oh! [grunting, shouting] I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it. That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I thr*aten to k*ll myself. Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop! Stop! Okay. Okay. Okay. Seriously! Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally] What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic. What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me. All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City. I haven't told you about her. Oh no, that's, that's not happening. Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought. [walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] "Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese." [opens the present and a snowball sh**t out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight! I surrender. Anything. You got it. You're a psychopath. What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim! Next up, secretary Schrute will read the minutes from Sunday's meeting. Oh. This meeting is for Knights of the Night only. I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on. Dwight, don't be bothered by your friend's presence. I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here. Sounds good. Smart. Go ahead and read it, some people weren't here. It was fun. Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board. They're so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put 'er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! That's a good firm handshake. You're hired! Yes, let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away. Hey, Dwight, I'm collecting resolution cards. Why not? Ugh. That's a good one. You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too. The bookstore? I'll come with you, show you how it's done. All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel. Hi. Why did we pretend like we work here? Good! Really? We kinda nailed it. Cool. A book about oceans. Whoa! Hold on. [Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh. I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that. I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties. Right on, son. And where did you go? So, that's it, guys? If you want, I can put on the strobe. I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office. Hey. [to Erin] How are the marks? I was thinking we could buy up of abandoned mine shafts.Phyllis, Stanley, Oooh! A lot of mines in Scranton. Uh, credit cards. My company would act as an intermedium, for like, point two cents off every transaction. Something with cell phones. It's like, every time you make a phone call I'd make point two cents. Or anything like any on-line shopping I would get point two cents. Great. What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team. It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some "Slumdog Millionaire" scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible. Well, I started my own golf supply company. It's taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth. Hmm? Some of these people are for real. Thank you. Excuse me. Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. [to Michael and Holly] Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on? Where's your jetpack, Zuckerberg? It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along. I can't wait. Which way did he go? She's right. He went that way. [on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hey Dwight. No, he hasn't. No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought... No. Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out... Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up] Okay. You've just lost my business. Hey, you were in there forever. She wandered off like an idiot. Hey. You know what? Say hi to Orville Tootenbacher for me. farts popcorn. Well, I think I can get through the door. What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying? I think he was heading downtown. I have no idea. I don't know. Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all. Okay. We fan out... Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below. Good. We don't need her. [on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles] [goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait. I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it. Thank you. All right. Dwight! Just leave it how you said... Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes? Pro. Make that face he likes. It's like a time b*mb... ...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging. Sexual time b*mb. [into recorder] Boner b*mb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera. No. [into recorder] Saving the world has never been this hard. No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending. Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces. Do the monkey face. I love that. I love that face. No. The monkey! Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop. That's good. That's good. He's throwing it. We took a walk. [Dwight Schrute dressed as a butler. Speaks in slow, deep voice] Master Scarn. Tell him I'm retired. Oh-[starts to freak out, but the scene is crudely cut short] Oh yeah! [laughs] Yes he is! You're eating eight year old tomatoes? I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh] Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging. Three months. Four months. Eight months? [Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months. One year. [time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months? Is Packer here? You did! You got b*rned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out. Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute. And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die. Thanks man, it'd mean a lot. well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk. Check it out! [grunting while humping Michael and Dwight] Don't even watch, Halpert! Oh, that's our Zen garden. [Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight. [continues working] Why? That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious] So, this hot chocolate thing. Well, you know you can't actually poison him. I really think we should join forces on this one. What do we think, what would drive him crazy. Here we go. You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them. Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number. He... It's a crime fighting beaver. Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred. [walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe] Yeah I couldn't cut it down. One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five? It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you! [trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you! Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I'm a huge boob nerd. He's a jerk. Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida? You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did. Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves. It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front. The signs will drive people inside. Close it. Close it. Close it. [starts wrestling Dwight] Just close it. Sure. Not so fast. Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here. Forget you. Fine, just give it. Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body. Screw you man. People like my stuff. You can take my Helen Fielding collection. Sure. How did those get out? I'm sorry. I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known. Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone. Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes. My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted. No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good. Thank you. Whatcha got there? Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco. things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have. [pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out. [to Dwight] Nice. Oh my God. It is right. I mean, it's impossible. They're probably worthless. Leave the telescope. Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, it's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else, I'm just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a- Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies. Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him. You know me very well, Dwight. Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day. I guess this is my life now. First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here. Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening. What recommendation? Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight. Anything can happen at the Dundies! [DeAngelo laughs] They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time! Black tie optional. So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. [Dwight looks suspecting] And that person is [he and DeAngelo roll their tongues as a drum roll] DeAngelo! [all applaud] Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods] [walks in] Hi! The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content. [jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo! [annoyed] Why? I can just run over to the gas station. [in the car] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well. Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a b*tch Award. What is your problem?! Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful. [sitting on the roof of the office building] Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude. Yes? Ahh, thank you. Like a butler. [Michael takes one and bites] Oh, these do not taste like oysters. Sick freak! What is wrong with you? I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? [Dwight scoffs] The job was not mine to give. [sighs] Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies. Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket... ...in order to feed the bears. How do you mean? Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni? [to Dwight] Do you believe that?! Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket] So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It's a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away] of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. [to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? [pulling out a small card from the envelope. Reads it] Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. [checks his watch quickly] Ohhh, yeah. You should see the other guy. [all are in the conference room for Michael's party. Michael isn't there. Jim gives the camera a knowing look] Well if he's not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. [Kevin nods] I for one love the corners. [cuts a corner piece, picks it up with his bare hands, and takes a bite] Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. [throws the piece in the garbage] No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. [grabs a piece from another corner. The office groans] What am I doing? [chucks it into the trashcan] Come on DeAngelo! [DeAngelo tries to lick the cake, everybody yells no] [holding two cups of coffee] There he is! Got ya coffee. [offers cup to Dwight] Not a coffee guy, I take it. Listen. I've got a sixer. "a*t*matic for the People" on the jukebox. Let's h*t the park after sundown. Come on! Pick up some sausage if you want. You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name. So I've never had to buy it. True story. I just drink my cousin's. You know what... straight up, why don't you like me? Ohhhh no. Okay? I'm gonna win you over. Yes I am. Oh yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Dwight, what's your take? Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates] Nope. Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office] Dwight? Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with. Do you need anything? Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. [laughter] Let's go downstairs! Okay? Let's do it. Damn it, Dwight! Enough! Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper! [Dwight immediately gets up and walks out] We could get Deangelo flowers. All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands] [on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy. Amen. Ooh, about what? I thought I needed to know for your calendar. Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in? You define foment. [clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system. Oh my God, what is wrong with you? It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal. No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying. Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know. Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture] Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site] Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic. And the desk. Okay. I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so... You can't f*re me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no f*ring powers. You wouldn't dare. [quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then. If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "Well that's pretty premature to think," but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared. I'm good. Why are you telling me this? Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster. Dwight, are you carrying a g*n? Dwight, g*n make me really uncomfortable. Why do you need to wear the holster at all? You could put your cell phone in it instead. You could put a banana in it. Dwight, no g*n, okay? Don't make us call Jo. Dwight went on a sh**ting spree, and then he sh*t Andy in the head. I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane. I'm gonna keep trying Jo. Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now! We all saw you do it. Navy blue. Little red anchors. I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands] I felt terrorized. Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that. Dwight, why is it on us to protect you? Hey. [Erin gasps] We're back. Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal. Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition. Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo? [singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a sh**ting spree? Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit. You have to get rid of all your w*apon. All of them. Including k*ller fish. Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good. Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in "Shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands? [quickly shakes his hands back and forth] Fine. Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers. Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. [Jim coughs] And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary. Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage. My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it. Hey, Jo! No, under the jacket. I don't feel anything. Push harder, Dwight. Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally] Knead it. Knead it like a pizza. Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel? What?! sh**ting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you sh*t a g*n? What is wrong with you? Beaumont-Adams is a girl's g*n. That just makes it plain stupid. Who else would be responsible? You sh*t a g*n off - Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius. I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job. Hey, Dwight. What's up? [to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that? Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks? [in elevator] Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that I'm gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that I'm never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and... I'm gonna die here. I just did. It's done. You don't know me! Anything about me! Get out of my head!] I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street. [nods at Dwight mockingly] [standing up] Get out. I don't have any, assh***. [comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview. Good! Yeah. Peepa. Great. No. You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again. [pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid. Yikes. Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile] Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you? Okay. Thank you. [softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes] Or what? You gonna sh**t me? I'll interview you right now. Question 1. Ever sh*t a g*n in the office? [seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. "Soo-ven-yay." Mr. "Jacques Soo-ven-yay." Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager. Assistant to the Regional Manager. What is it? I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question. [Gabe gets up to leave] If he isn't here in sixty seconds... [looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off] Let's just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what? All that for this job. [as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office. All right. Name. Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know. I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know. [ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss. Yes. Thank you, Dwight. No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen. Okay. Take care, man. [geeky voice] I want the job. I really do. It's just, the rest of my family's in the Finger Lakes right now. I'm supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now. I told them I was on a hike; snuck away to do this interview. I gotta get back pretty soon; they'll worry. People disappear in the Finger Lakes. [exiting elevator] After you my good sir. I can't get down. K... Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight's desk] Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I've got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I've added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I'm doin' great. I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman. Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this? Say no more. Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women's soccer, no? It's, it's nothing. No. Okay. Um, I'll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone? Ahhh! [falls out of chair] Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Thanks guys. Left. Okay, it's not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make. ‘Scuse me? [separately] No. Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl, Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar. That's regular pizza. I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you. Well, what about the other guys. No. I don't- I don't wanna say- No, no. Ha, I guess I think they're losers. Yeah? Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word "no" not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I'm being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with. Good night Andy. When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling] They see. Ooh, why is it shaped like that? It's huge. How much does it weigh? How much memory does it have without the booster? How many L to a K? Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight's meeting. Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause...... I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax. Ok, I'm sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog...had to pull rank. [to group] OK, let's look at some ties. Here's how I'm going to help out from now on. I'm going to not care, and I'm going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy's inevitable demise. Dwight, anything? D-Bone. There you are. No, that's ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about... I know, right? Yeah...um, how is everything? Must be a tough time to be a family farm. Oof. What are you gonna do about that? There's gotta be some way you can double your beet sales... Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case...let's get to work. Invest in softer cotton, sir. [tattooing begins] OW! Oh! Oooh! [Crowd cheers] oh, whoa!! Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I'm gonna like it. Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog. Dwight! At least aim it. Come on buddy, get back. Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay. Yeah, that's pretty good. Nice job. Awesome. I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money. Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you... OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad. Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.] Alright. There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids. Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people. I'd go with that. Yeah we move stuff and it was fun. Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs] So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to. Kevin Costner. So, it's not the dumbest idea. But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes. So sadly, it's the best idea on the table. Is he OK? Why is the truck empty? Is that grease on my floor? And we did. Porque es muy rapido. Let me see it. Let me see it! Okay, don't be gross. Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way. Yeah, Dwight. No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO! Just give us the address. We'll look it up online. See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time. [pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw] Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea? There's so much more to it than that. It's a little tricky, you might have to... take... [Mose speeds away] Chapter 2 – Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present. Wow. [mouthful of food] I understand. Chapter 4 – One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon. I think we should toast... That's because you didn't bring a jacket. Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here. Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me? We'll talk. [walks away] I think I left my wallet in your house. Right here. Keys, keys... I didn't forget them, they're right here. I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing... Whoo. Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office? [Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you? What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman? Whoopi Goldberg. Very low pressure in the Sargasso Sea, warm air from South America, cold air from Greenland. All signs point to the perfect storm. What are you, anyway? If you had some really big wings with blades on the end, you'd kind of look like Kerrigan from Starcraft. If you're going to be a Zerg, at least be a Lurker, not some girl. Yeah, she also has boobs. Mmhmm. Dwight are you eating a stick? Everyone hates you. What do you like? Tornadoes? Oh yeah? What's the vaccine you can take to avoid a hurricane? [to Dwight] Are you serious? That's funny. Ok. Thank you. Dwight? Dwight. Dwight! Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes... [to dwight] Did you need something from us? Wha...Yes. Your attention. Uh because... No that is all. [walks out] Yeaha...yup. [awkward silence then points to door] Just trying to get in. What do you got? Sounds controversial. Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop. Go do the voodoo that you do so well. And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call...Dwight... If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper. What emails are you talking about? That's not that bad actually. Wait, so you installed a doomsday device? Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device. We can't do this Dwight. [Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smile...nod. Smile and nod. Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes. There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment. Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I... Alright everybody, you are doing great! Dwight, question. If this doomsday device goes off... If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that? Ok. Nope. Dwight we got five strikes. Did the email go out or... Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it. Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password. What?! We did our best. You're a real crumb bum, you know that? Uh, the man tree puts its penis- Nn no. Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down! I'll try both. Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you- What are you doing? Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in] [to Dwight] Where you going? Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water. Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is. Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right? No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha. You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk. I'm thinking cow- Hahhh, thanks for everything. Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs. This isn't one of those times. It's the police. They said it's the worst they've ever seen. Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this. You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It's a pregnant Helen Mirren.[everyone agrees] In this case yes. No we're not. Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves] Yes, because she's hot, right? Dwight, am I hot right now? What about before? Was I attractive before? Hmm. I think Jim's lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy. Five bucks if you can get him to admit it. Yep, that's the Dwight I need. Okay. I think so. Okay. Well, what does that... is that... okay. Yep, good. Honesty is very important to me. Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam. Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person. Jim's on to me. Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it. Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy. No, Kelly, don't. With the crotch? [music plays] Whoo! Who said that? How'd I get this long triangle? Is he puffing out his chest? No. Maybe he just said something funny. I think he's just making her laugh. Why's he making her laugh so much? Are you okay? Dwight! Dwight! [to Cathy] Sorry about that. Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why? Leave. Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now. Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do. I think the music left without you. Stop shoving me. Uh, are you all in line? Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him? You have to share the machine with others. Thank you. No, no, no. I have a new heart, you know. No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time. No. Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test? Wait, what? Jim, you have high blood pressure. I don't know. Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul. Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor. Just go home. It doesn't matter. That sounds super inspiring! I'm in! Actually it is the northernmost. Ha! I'm in too. [to Dwight] Yeah, but I'm confused... Mm-hmm. Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths. Dwight, what are you telling this girl? Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said. Interesting. Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal? he's a historian. Yes, yes, yes! Yes! Argh! What? Erin- Oh, well, that's a great question. Actually some of the most- Sure. Uh, I haven't heard of that one. Alright fine. You know what – I guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would. I'm still going. And I'm not going to ask anymore. I'm not even going to look back. I'm just going to assume that you're with me. Dwight – this is one of the archivists here. I thought maybe we could consult him. Yeah. You've heard about it? Dearest mother I'm sorry it has been so long since my last letter. It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms and I fear I may never leave this place alive. Melvin Fifer Garris. Wow. This is so much better than the story you made up. [knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning. Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR. No. No. No. You're way off on that one. Hey guys let's just all admit it. Ok? Dwight's better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he's never, ever going to go back on it right? Hey man. Taking a load off huh? Good luck with that. Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again] [sees a pole poking out Dwight's pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet] Prank! [throws money from Dwight's wallet on the floor] You know what it's not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right? Because you're sitting? Ok. Because you're sitting? You know I have to do this. Alright. You don't have to say it if you're doing it. Uh weight lifting yeah. I'll take a look. I've been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn't realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents. Well it's sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection. Well it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult. I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that. You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute. Dwight why don't you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals. Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they've ever been to me. What I wouldn't give for one of Phyllis' classic room clearing farts right now. Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5. Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I'm not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym. We promised we'd never say goodbye. Enough Oscar, enough. I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet. Got it. Getting my sweat on. I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill. No. Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow. It's Lejon Brames. You know, get it right. Oh boy. Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say. Okay, I'm not doing that. Hmm? This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy. Dwight, come back and spot me. To push this bar up. Help me! To look good for Val! Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required. That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon. Light side. As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront. Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words "HARD ASS"] But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps. Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he. What was that? Can't do that. So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me. [serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding! Oh my god. I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine? No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife. Nice try, this is ridiculous. Three times. OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control... [on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up. [on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled? And what's it's name? I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.[Christmas Time is Here by Vince Guaraldi Trio is playing in the background] Ah! My Santa suit's stuck. Whoo. Dwight. Aw! It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person! Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage. Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine. Oh, hello Mr. Schrute. I'll tell him you're here. Can I get you anything at all? Dwight? What are you doing here? Course I know. Dwight. You made it. Impressive initiative. I don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination. [Gabe laughs] Well, uh, let me settle in and I'll be with you shortly. [on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up] What's the most important appliance in your house? [makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential. Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO. CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes. Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a f*re, so your appointment got- Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf. Chill, man. This plan is airtight. Well, you got my vote. I know. What? You're doing great. You know, so good. Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! [Gabe makes a flushing motion, Dwight twists Gabe's arm] Ow! Ow! He went home. Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing. Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help! So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no. I don't know. All I know is the building. They haven't really improved on the Oreo, have they? Sit down, Dwight. You were dining alone? All those people are you? It's wet, it's filled with mold, strange insects, alligators. Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight. You know that, right? [holds a medal to the light] This medal was my grandfather's. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It's a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better? [holds out medal] Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I'll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place.  It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird. You've been meatballed! [laughs] Are you ready for some meatball? Look for your stapler! [to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul? Good day. Oh, who needs a house that size? Hey, Dwight Snoot. What you doing? Come on, don't you want to play? Yeah. [Dwight dunks her] Oh! Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous. [giggles] Stop. No, you stop. [to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop. No, no, no, he's not looking. I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't b*rned off yet. Awkward stage. Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end. What is the most romantic possible thing? Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all. Dang it! What the heck already? I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath. [knocks Cathy off Kevin's shoulders] Yes! Woo! Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together. Yeah! Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what. Mush, mush, mush! Come on! [muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it- Sure. Sure we did. Shut it, Angela. Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday. Mmm. Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me. We're done. Erin and I are over. Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out. It was pretty uneventful, actually. Nope. Not guilty. We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come. Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas. He's more than substantial. He's a monster. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, wait, wait. No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you. What's up, gangstas? Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory. No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill. Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch. Attaboy. Good. Now, chill. Yeah, sure, of course. I'd f*re him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously] [pulls food truck up to where Dwight and Nate are standing] Where you want I park? Uh, I'm going to say "I" when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of "he says blah, blah, blah," I'm going to say "I say, blah, blah, blah," but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, "He remembers Toby." [makes face] "I remember Toby." The empanada guy! He says, "No." Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients. Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink. Why? Everybody's heard it. His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse. Funny? No? Nobody laughing? Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good. Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die. Dwight, cut it out. I'm not f*ring Jim. I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap] [on voicemail] You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao. [beep] Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP. Dwight. Hey. He went to the car or something, but he'll be back. Don't you want to see the baby? I promised I wouldn't tell. Angela got pregnant before the wedding. She got pregnant before the wedding. A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me! Dwight. Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it. Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves. Mama! Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby. That is completely untrue. Completely true. Remember? Angela. No. I did not. Uh-uh. That didn't happen. No! Stop it! Dwight. And even if it did, it's just a coincidence. I will not. All done? Yes, yes. He's sleeping. Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head. Who are you? Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here. You had something important to tell me? Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant. Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi! Dwight, I have exciting news for you. I think you're going to like it. Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that... That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk. No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah! Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a "we're just friends" beanie or a "I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'" beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie. Really? Ooh, me three. Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about? [reading card] "I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day." Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves. Kathy. You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar? Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps? They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find. Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin. You have your team. Back off! I got my reasons. Why? What?! It just feels like a slap in the face. We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are. Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape. What are the criteria for going? Mooshie mooshie. [Dwight laughs] My baby is not a monster! Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me. OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out. Five to six hours? No no no no. Nope. I am... Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that. Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something... It has been a long, lonely winter. Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team. I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head. Exactly. Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go. You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go. Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone] Essential. Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks. Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates. Kathy.. ....Stanley.. ...Ryan... ...Erin... ...And, Jim. You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! Why is it so hot in here? But... No no, I want to go. Is that the buzzer from Taboo? SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it. How did a mosquito get in here? I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits] Mosquito. Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie. I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back. So, what is this special project? That sounds awesome. Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it. How do we make this a better party? Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us? [long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?  Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late. Wake up! [Cathy screams] Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep. Mmm! [struggles] Ugh! I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides] What do you think happened? Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before. Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. g*n goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan. I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her. What does he like? Okay, and this one is, "Huh. Don't see too many museums around here." Hey, are you okay? Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you. Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, "For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?" and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something? Still q*eer? Let me just get the projector working. You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote. Okay. Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. [points to Ryan] You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon. I can do it. Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go. Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding. Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance? Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense. Did you say "masturbator?" Why are you sitting down like that? I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt. Dude, I think you have appendicitis. Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while? Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen. No one's moving! Oh, oh! [general commotion] Two or three days. Drama queen, am I right? I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] Oh, there's the phone! Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later. Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess. Very good point. Dwight, are you all right? I'm great. How are you? Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours. Do a hundred jumping jacks. [doing jumping jacks] Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine- You haven't done any of the research. Yup. Ah, what is your topic? Retail consumer habits. Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay. I can field this one. Are those the lyrics? [whispers] Convenience. Service. Building loyalty. Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight. You are bleeding through your shirt. How are you feeling? Can I see the wound? Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed. A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet. Oh, yikes. Incoming- [tries to touch the wound] It would be an honor, ma'am. I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now. That's great. Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP. I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more. Catching butterflies. Theater. Dragging. Dragging sticks. Not good enough (clicks tongue) Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him. Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips. What happens if you're the hunchback? How many buttons do you have? Can I see? So, I get to kick you now. College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight) I will be here. Oh, please, You're through. She's going to give it to me as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle. [clicks tongue, whinnies] What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me. Like I'm on the beach.[Packer blows in Nellie's ear] Impressive. You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit. [on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt. Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis. What's in it for GSL? Got it. If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses. I haven't seen anything. Jeez... Brown, shiny, painful bite. Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation. So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this. Yeah. I know. Ow. Just check it. Alright. He knows what he's doing. Alright, then I will catch you later... What do we do now? I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again. Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here. Come on. You know what? Maybe they just ate. Okay, they're fine. They're adults. Is that really how you want to get this job? They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore! Put your forehead near mine, and see if you can read my thoughts. No, no, no, not numbers, no. No. Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time. Mm-hmm. mm-hmm... I will see you in seven- Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]... Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie] Cathy, go. Awesome. Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?! I can't breathe! Nice job, I think you got 'em. [Jim face] [whispers] Is that Nellie?  Are you holding this chair? ‘cause I feel like I'm gonna fall off. I'm not wearing the right shoes for this. Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I'm this patrician goddess. But here's the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ... what's lower than dirt? Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey. When people see this presentation, they're gonna [bleep] in their pants. Seriously disgusting. Ugh. k*ll me. That was my idea. I don't see what that gets us, but I'm a team player. I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples. I didn't do anything any of you wouldn't have done. Quit it. I was ahead of you! Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad. Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really -- on the Internet, it's a really -- that's a really good, good, thing. I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck? You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck!  Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do. Point it towards the store, idiot! [laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over. [softly] Take that, kid. Patty Grossman. I'm a woman. Yes. Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it? You know what? Dwight. God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say. You're so ignorant. You barely know what you're talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books. Oh! "Fix" means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink! No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red! Oh... [Kelly laughing] I'm on break. When's the presentation? Well... About ten minutes. Oops, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out? What is the delay here? Where's Ryan? Why is he not here? What? That's.... I'm not doing the Presentation. Okay, I'll do it. A costume? Of course there's a costume! [laughs]  Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation. I've been in here for 20 seconds. I'm not wearing eyeliner. Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that's -- This... is the future, because... This is the past. I've been through a lot of issues in my life. I've seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I've been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause] Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain K*llers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off.  I just feel good! Dwight.  You're the vice president. [squealing] aagh! Aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling] [feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow! Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo. I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either. Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift] He doesn't even care. [to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it. [attempts to shake Dwight's hand] Goodbye, Dwight. I couldn't just k*ll the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight. [to Dwight] Bravo, Dwight! Very good! [Jim looks surprised] [to Jim] Shame. I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen. When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to Nellie] You'd spin off right. I'd spin off- [enters room] All right. There he is. Can I just talk to you for one quick second? Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway] Nice. [To Jim] Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy? Aw, I'm just trying to- That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made. You know, I just think you should know that- Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again] [enters abruptly] Dwight. OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please? Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store. Dwight, he's gonna k*ll the store. And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna f*re you for it. Yes. Dwight, please. OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so- Dwight, come o- Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight] Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva? Gross! What? What, what, what, what, what? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I forgot. You all right? You ok? We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly] What are you doing? Get up. Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by. OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work. [tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no. This is dangerous. Why? Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away] I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, "Look, a balloon." And I was still just a paper salesman. Yeah. Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here. What? Dwight, should she be our manager? I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm. Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight. Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise. Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise? Then you accept it? Absolutely not. Seven percent. The raise isn't real. I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that. No. No. No. No. No. Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off. [Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow. Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache] Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands] He does have a moustache. What does that mean? Let's help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place. What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh] Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door. That was one time- Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight. Andy! Hey! Yes, you should. [reads] "Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie." I doubt that they're sh- Whoa. Who is this guy? Boyfriend. Like a boyfriend? Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out. I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry. God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant. I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories. [yells] What the hell? All right, where's Phyllis? Who's Phyllis? Look. This is really uncool, okay? I put on a clean show here- What? What happened to old salty? Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato. When you lost the manager job- Did it affect you outside of the office? I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis? Oh, okay. Okay. Oh. I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming. One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that. Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on. What do you mean? This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem. Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie? Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times. I know, right? Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles. That's... That's not the point! My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district! What's going on? How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there? No! It was my idea to not be r*ped! Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody. [on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you! The winner of the three day trip to the sky top lodge is Dwight Schrute! The yearlong membership to Scraton-Bikram Yoga is Dwight Schrute! A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to Dwight Schrute! Well, I think I can save us some time, Dwight Schrute has won every single item here! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat. I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They'd flex them all night at the discotheque. Yeah. All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go. Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows. We got it? All right, easy there, grandpa. Okay. You don't need my help? All right, well, enjoy the alumni game. Thanks Janet. Wow, simultaneous sale. Hey, hey, come on, language. In the fridge. Jim, Dwight, what are your last names? The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it. Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money. Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch] There's actually not a rule that says that. No. Robert's here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to h*t each other with. I don't think we were doing that. Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There's no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems... so poorly timed. Listen, Robert, I don't have time. There's a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions – Used to be Binghamton's – I want it, it's mine. We need you to make a decision. Is it just me or is our boss a freakin' weirdo? [stands up, walks outside] I'm gonna get some air. [Gets up and looks out Nellie's office window] He's running! Damn it. It's a monkey. Hold on, hold on. Is this him? Is that him? What? What am I gonna do? I don't – Dwight! Nos? You mean like in fast and furious? Oh, yeah, definitely have nos. Are you sure? Brace yourself. 3... 2... Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe... you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember. Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together] You all right? [Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing? What are you talking about? I don't even know where the stairs are! [Dwight jumping] What are you doing? What? My pants fell down! I don't have a belt! What's going on? Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse – Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay. Let me stop you all right here. I've already picked a new paper supplier. Give me a cup of coffee. All right, guys. It didn't work out for any of us, so... we're still on the same team. Let me get these. You know, your partner's got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating? But you're saying there's a chance. Oh, man, I'd have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions. Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine. What's he doing? No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead. Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God! Fine. One, two, three! I don't want to! ...their own children. No thank you. Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest. Wait, C-R-A-Z... Great. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, so that's it? See? That wasn't so hard. Thanks. Dwight. [Phillip cries] See the duckie! [slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is. Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate. I guess we're okay with the fingernails. I'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second. No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight! Do you see David Wallace in the room right now? It's been a great year. Where is it? How long does it take to get the results? You're gonna wait here? Andy's coming back today! Andy's coming back today! Ha! Andy's coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time. No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane. Whoa! Mind blown. It's like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr? Dwight, Jr! [Dwight gives Clark a noogie] Now I know why Michael hated you so much. I think I'm busy that night. Or I would. Learning what? Kay. Is this—is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that's totally fine. Like, I'm fine with it. But you should know that I'm into the ladies. You know, if you're ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you. So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven't had time to pursue yet? Yeah, I'll just give it a glance— I'll give it a read. Yeah. I am. Ok. You're not getting my clients! Nice try. Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job. Done. Explain. Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday. The new guys called one. Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black? Hey, yes. Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail? Well it's official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool. This is a bloodbath. Alright, I'm calling this. It is enough of this. Everyone, let's go back to work. This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots. Dwight! [sees trapeze contraption] What are you doing? Oh, come on, Pete! God, that's just sad. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim. I will? Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds. No. Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life. Exactly the way it is. Yes, and there's nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it. Find someone else, I don't know. Ask Phyllis. Kay. Ok. [prepares bike trapeze]Oh, god.[Jim tries dialing and hangs up] Hey, man. It's halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don't. I'm in. Yeah, yep, I'm all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah! Dwight, what about you? Dwight, you will be participating. Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like. Great, thank you. [everyone groans] Oh, for goodness' sake, Dwight. Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back. You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here. Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract] [takes contract] Absolutely, I will. [holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this? Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it. Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off. I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity. In that case, you... [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand. I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands. [whispering] Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard. Is it gonna be long? God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well. Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know. [Andy smiles at camera] 127 hours. It's about this guy who- My bad. Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy. That is absolutely revolting! He is so good, though. The way he just cuts off his arm. Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time. Well, it doesn't make you stupid. Stupid like you. Like you. You're the stupid one. You're the stupid one. Who am I? I'm Jim. We've been working together for twelve years. Ha, Weird joke, Dwight. You seriously never noticed? Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race. You have one new message. Dwight, cut it out, I'm trying to work. Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours. I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim![Dwight shows fake Jim of the Halpert family portrait but notices that Jim and the kids have been replaced with fake Jim and Asian kids] [speaking in French] S"il vous plait...dites-Moi...Ugggghhh les Bleagh! I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there! You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild. Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic w*r-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads. Yeah! Let's do it! [shocked] Oh! Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy. Foth aggendak! Foth aggendi! Foth aggenda! [in a barbaric growl] Forth aggenda! Addor! Qazer! Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language. Dwight's grandfather was a—[is interrupted by Dwight]. I was gonna say he was a tax evader. Yeah, that—you're being really mean, Andy. A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! [Points to video] Who's this guy?[Jim steps back and forth from plate on video as Andy sings Meow Mix theme]Look at him dance. Fail! [Group continues chanting "Fail!"]That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm. [Group keeps chanting] You're all failing right now. [Group continues] Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail! [Group claps and chants] What's going on? What's he measuring? Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven. OK, listen. Everything here is up to code. Sure. I'll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I'll sign that. You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts. Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests] I'm not gonna grow a third arm! headaches..." "..breast pain..." Oof. "Infertility." Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me? What? That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag...[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight's chair] Oh my god. Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement. Nice job. What? [Bus pulls into lot] Bring it in! Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking? Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam. Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever? No question. [To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh? Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work. OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop. No! Pies! Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing- What? Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank. No. Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant. That doesn't matter. Ok...that's not... Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children? Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin.. Whoa! Whoa! Dwight! [group reacts] You feel OK now? Don't..  [screaming upon seeing pumpkin-headed Dwight] [screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision I've ever made. It won't budge. I can't get it out. Try again! I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin... [as Jim approaches with a Kn*fe] Jim, no. No. No! No! But as Jim and I discovered... No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me. Aaah! [everyone clapping] So good! Okay. Shut up. [laughs] [laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it stop it stop it stop it! [picking up spilled candy] Hello little pill. What do you do? [laughing] Gross. I love it. Something wrong Dwight? Yes? The mind is part of the body. Dwight, our co-workers' health issues are really none of our business so- Yeah, you're right. This man needs to be apprehended. All right. [laughs] Awesome. Cool. You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning. I can't really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks. Get under your chin first. Yeah. Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah. Yeah, that's crazy. Hey. [laughing] It's funny right? [Toby starts to lean in for a kiss, then runs away] Okay, look Dwight, let's just call this thing off. I mean, it's just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety. Cool. Free upper. Don't dog catch me! The pill is mine. Get her out. Show some pride. This is crap. Oh. Oh, well good for you. I mean, you'll need a prescription. Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he's a good man and that I hope he feels better. The real Mose. Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand] I do! I do. I do. I do. I do. We're done Meredith. Dwight! No, you chose yourself. Awesome. Have fun. [Darryl plays radio show music on keyboard] And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute. Let's do it! [As Iris] So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command? Uh, excuse me. [reading card held up by Jim] I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons? [Jim mimes taking shirt off] I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together. Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. [Jim holds up card that says "Now Pants"] Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine. Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble. I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic? Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do. No the paper's not toxic. Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic! What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?! Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to? Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron? Are you insulting my guests? Oh that is nice. Classy move. [leaves] The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%. Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time? [using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm] Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record! [On phone] Hello? Dwight? Yeah? Are you ok? Well, thanks Dwight. Dwight? What? Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go. Shrute! Shrute! Shrute!Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! [joins in] Shrute! Shrute! Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh. [on speakerphone] Well, I have some very exciting news. Jim, good! You should hear this too. [taking away Dwight's handset] Go ahead David, I'm listening. Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They've apparently just dropped the supplier they've been with for the last ten years. . The White Pages. Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you. He's in the bathroom. Of course. [from the kitchen] Eat it Stanley! No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It's someone new but she didn't catch her name. No, hey, Dwight shouldn't... Good luck! Dwight, you can't go. You have a problem with women. You can't sell to them. Yeah, she said she corrected him five times. So, uh, show us how you'd normally sell to a female client. Okay, you just walked into her office and begin. Hello. I am? Hmm.. [deep voice] Hi, I'm Mr. Hannon. How can I help you? Oh, I'll be the buyer. Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat. No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs. Okay, let's stop here. Anyone have any thoughts? Okay, when you're selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now? Okay, well you have to show us. Huh. [nodding] Uh huh. A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it? It's just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person. And then we thought we'd ... I can't. I just can't carry on with that face. Look at it. I'm gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he's laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh. Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It's all garbage okay? You're the woman, I'm the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn. Ms. Thomas, so good to see you. Oh, are those your kids? They're so cute! They could be models. You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women. Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience? Okay, so, when you're selling to this woman, just imagine that she's that nice, reasonable barber. Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps. Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs? Okay, great. Oh my God. It's Jan. I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct? I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace after all these years. Oh, well. What are you doing? Stop. Stop that. You did good, Dwight. It's okay. I mean, seriously, Jan's not normal. Let's just go. She's not going to sell to us. No. Where's the Quizno's? I -- I -- Do what? Get into sales? That's what I want. Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business. Thanks. Okay. Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number. That's a license number? Oh. Why me? She doesn't know. I shouldn't be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a h*m*. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love. [upon seeing Dwight naked] Ugh! Dwight, it's not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on. Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh. My marriage is in danger. I don't know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me. Something like that. Can you arrange a meeting? Okay. Okay. Okay. Ow! Dwight! Ow! Is it safe to talk? Do you have a g*n? Read the receipt. That's a $300 g*n. Someone could steal it. Now I keep it in a safe. Oh, you tell me. [shows Dwight receipt] All right. Okay, that's the big one. That's the big "M." What if they deserved it? They're sleeping with my husband. This seems a little crazy. But I think I'm up for it. Thank you. What about a knee-capping? Yes, a knee-capping could work. You said you would be there for me. It's the only thing that will make this right. What? Why did you call me out here? I don't know what you're talking about. Fine! It's Oscar. So what? Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband. Well, you might be right. But it's too late now. He's here. No! No, no! [groans] What? What are you doing? Got it. Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, don't lie. I'm trying to save those precious knees you're always bragging about.  Now, let's get out of here. He could be right behind us. Let's get it on. I'm gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but I'm gonna do this. I got it. You don't-- [all three grunting] Okay, okay, okay, okay. See ya later, Heymont. What the hell, Dwight? you are incorrigible! I'm so sorry. Angela-- I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day. [crying] Jazz is stupid!  I mean, just play the right notes! I don't like your friend Trevor. Shut up, Hide!  I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I'm okay with that. Is it called red-vining? I don't... People red vine. They don't have vaginas. No. They're just regular men. 00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking. So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word "Philadelphia"? Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people? Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand? Too weird. [Clears her throat] The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas. Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously. And that is... That there are no rules. Thank you. Ugh. What is this stuff, lava? What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don't touch it. Oh! Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat. Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine? How would anyone even know-- So happy right now.[Jim and Pam get up and run out into The Office] It's the lining of the stomach of-- Yes, he is finally nigh. I am nigh! Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel. So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse. And the fear. Come on, Dwight, you're making this up. Wow. Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No. [Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful. Thank you, Dwight. These are nice. Oh, it's like naughty or nice. Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list? Oh, nice. Did you check that list? But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake. Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's-- Damn. [Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these? I'd rather have the bowl. Ow! You h*t people with that thing? [Holds the mouse trap up] Mouse trap.[While Dwight is decided on others, he puts canning jars in Angela's bowl, and a twig in Stanley's, then a normal talking head] Oh, you know what? I gotta go. Yeah, it's all right. I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay. Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep. Ooh. That's right. Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody. You know what? Yeah. Have at it. Ooh! Are you nuts? Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't h*t anybody that hard. [As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh! What's going on? For what it's worth, I liked your party better. I don't think anyone thought that. Well, that didn't have anything to do with you. Zero. Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog? What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building. No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss] 00 a.m.[All cheering and chanting as Jim and Dwight try and break the pig rib] [Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa![Everyone shouts alarmidly] Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower? Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly. Just lice Pam? Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7. Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear. What are you wearing? No. I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this. No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats... What do we do about our heads? Okay. [handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away. Put those away before you hurt yourself. Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall. Is there a volume knob on that thing? Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam. Dwight, are you okay!? I'm back together with Val. Yay... Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They're a family owned business [chuckles]. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We'd go in pretending to be family – brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store. Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew. Sorry, Stinky, can't do it. Too busy. Okay. There's no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something. I have ears, Dwight. Hey, I'm in Philadelphia right now. Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour? Actually, it's pronounced "espresso"... Wait. That's what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So... If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission. [sarcastically chuckling] I loved it. If it'll lead to me being a salesman, I'll pretend to be your friend. [chuckling] It's kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store. No, we sure hadn't Pop. [both chuckling] He calls me Clarky ‘cause he's my Dad. My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he's like a serial k*ller... of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick! [Dwight imitates sawing and blood spurting out of his neck, then makes a dying noise] [back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home. [sighs] I can't relate to that, my son hates my guts. Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that? [enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but... God I missed you! [confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool. ...And I love you, for saying that. [catches on] Ha ha! I just b*rned him. Because the truth is... our relationship is... terr- Terrible. Well, I understand, but – Listen to him. He created you. Women don't despise me... Alright, that's enough, ‘cause I can say some things about him too. Like the time that you got drunk and, and then... k*lled those kids on their way to prom! So we can offer you matte or glossy printing- There's obviously a volume discount uh, if you- Here he is, my son. I'm sorry, you guys are here to sell us paper? Sons used to idolize their fathers. Okay Pop... [to Clark in dressing room] That's Italian silk. Very comfortable. Very tasteful... Although expensive. Well, that's better than looking like the undertaker from boring island. [emerges from dressing room wearing a sharp black suit] How do I look? What's going on? You opened the door- Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right? Why?  I don't get it. A lightbul-- Whoa. I don't. Annex. It must open something in the annex. Whoa. "Sedes introiti." Seat of entrance. Oh, I expected more from young Halpert. Cece's ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I've been working with her on her move. It's called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It's kind of like this. It's pretty cute, right? Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That's why I'm doing it. Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I'm switching over. Yep. Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity. Yeah. Even you. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man.  "Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously." I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie. [murmuring] Wait. This says "Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge"? Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I'm getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows. Yeah, we'll see about that. They got us set up with Windows 95,  so you're kind of dreaming here. Okay, I'm gonna need you to print it out.[dot matrix printer beeping and whirring loudly] Ooh, it's when you get a free sandwich after you've already eaten ten sandwiches. Thank you. Thank you. Loyalty. Loyalty is exactly right. I'm sorry. Do I still need to be here? I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let's-- let's use an example. Take Erin. Erin's boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean. Shh! Kids are dancing. Dwight, look, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that. It can. All right, let's get this over with. You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah! How far is this place? [turns off radio] I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no. They have fast food in Philly. And your milkshake. It's 30 degrees out. You drinkin' a mildshake? Nope. [throwing milkshake] f*re in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that's what working at a paper company's all about![Darryl take keys out of ignition] You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage. Hello, Peter. f*re in the hole! [throwing milkshake] Go! Go! Go! Go! [tires screech] Lady...you never stop surprising me. [clears throat] Hey, so I hear you're bringing in some people to interview for the sales job? Well, uh... see, you raised it. Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did. You know what, man? I deserve this job. I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond... and under. You know what? You're gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you're going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance. This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome. You could've just called that an alliance too, right? There he is. Nice. Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix – me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So... problem solved. Thanks, guys. I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone. I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don't do earbuds. [sighs] It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter. Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you're qualified to evaluate me? What are your credentials? I think I've heard everything I need to hear. Thank you, Dwight. I'll be in touch. Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, "Jump," and he says, "Oh who?" He loves to jump on people, that Trevor. Ooh, okay. Didn't see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it. Pass. Next one. No, no and no. Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking? I looked at you coming around, and I said, "Wintergreen." I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly. That's just a classic no-win situation. So I'd Kobayashi Maru it. Yep. You know what, Dwight? This interview's over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru'd the whole process. Yeah. Star Trek rules. Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that? [chuckles] Walked right into that one. Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise. People person. That's right. Yes. Okay. X-Men school? Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input— Hey, Dwight. It's David. Jim says he'd like some say in the hiring process. Okay. I can't say that that's not fair. Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later. Uh... [clears throat] Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call? Yes, okay. Bye. No, thanks. Dwight, you can't just hire someone ‘cause they're your friend. They're freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks. Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch. Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch. Wolf is hilarious. He has ex*cuted me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ‘em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof. Do you want this paper? It's not very good. I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad. Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It's over. I am. I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University. Thank you. [chuckles] Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no f*re in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He's a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I'm hesitant. Why can't I pull the trigger on any of them? Do you need to be changed? Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I've been double-parked for five hours. I'm wondering if I should move my car. Yeah, whether it's me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvina— Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you. I could start Monday. Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'. That's what I always say. Just act natural. [grunts] But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars. Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor? I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin. Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You? I'm sorry? Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say. Too much now. Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep. No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don't open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe. I got it. Paintball. [yelling] And what are we supposed to do until then? Take care of my wife. I will be back. I'm good. Oh, I'm sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee. Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy? Us. Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I'll distract him, you take that. [shushes]Pam & [laughs] No! No, Dwight! [entering office] Conference room. Everybody. Now! Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting. Yeah. [as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go. You will? I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car. [approaches Dwight as he leaves] Hey! Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you. What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people. Aw, crap. You're gonna to compare 'um to the butts up there. [gestures mural] All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws. OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go. We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could cr*ck him. See, I feel bad about that. So, she's gonna pull through again? [all nod] That's great. Can I talk to her? Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business. All right. You can go. Give him his gum. That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy. We should just take him down. I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face. Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt. Yes! Yes! We need an infiltrator. Clark? Oh, crap. Were those yours? Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys. What lines? Oh, great! [to Dwight] His truck! OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that? I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural? Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet. Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid. Yeah. And he has saggy boobs. Yeah. I feel better. I know. You miss Angela, don't you? Perfect. [Pete walks away eying the camera knowingly] [knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in. [talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract. [pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-d*ck-doo, rick-a-d*ck-d*ck-d*ck, rick-a-d*ck-doo. Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up. [to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign. [in his office doorway, bearded and unkept] Hi Dwight. Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin. Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. [removes wooden instruments from bag] Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. [removes güiro and begins playing and singing] Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. [sings while Kevin echoes] Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months? I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous. And you sold it to Jan too. I mean... I'm impressed. Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight. I was... That... OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'. Say it. Coolio. Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up. Hmm. Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing? Yeah. You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option. Well, ah, ah... Uh-huh... [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed. He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right? God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months. Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands. I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip. You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank... What?! There was a f*re in the warehouse? Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note. [on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do. Ahh! Dwight! What? What is it? Dwight, that's awful. What do you mean by "poisoned"? Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt. But I don't see how this is my problem. Ugh. Gah. It's fine. Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll- I'll help you! Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now? I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow. Who's this little kitchen witch? She's so tiny like a little kitchen witch. New clothes? What for? [Aunt Shirley's boob shows] Oh, God. Ow! I could do that. No. No. No. Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly. [coughs and laughs in her sleep] Spray her down? Time to get clean! You have to use chains? Let's get this show on the road. Dwight! No! No! Stop your belly-aching and hose me. No Dwight! No, Dwight! No Dwight, I won't- [hoses Dwight] [grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub? I feel like a show pony. You're welcome. Would you like some stew? Mmhm. Is it any good? Alright. So, tell me all about it. It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight. No, Dwight. The Senator. I can't be your monkey, Dwight. I made a vow. I gave my word.  Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are. Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close? I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother. My condolences. OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails? [while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god. I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session... [as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place. OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball. OK. [playing guitar and singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning'] Zeke's here. 'Hi' to Mom. Will there be ghosts there? You get in the sidecar. Get... You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face. [as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that? You have a brother? [gathers and tastes soil] Huh. It's crap soil. Nothing's going to grow here. Yeah, well, I'm just saying it's garbage soil, that's all. It's fine 'cause they're not going to grow. Would the family care to say something? [approaches and hugs Dwight] I see you started without me. Blugh. Dwight. Hi Dwight. This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn. We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here. Land size? [all shake heads] [removes hat] Shirley, at 1600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area. Sharing borders with six other farms. Including my own farm. And your nephew Dwight's. [replaces hat] OK. [drives away] Oh, right. Uh, you know, I don't think we have to do this. [on a recorded video] Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life's big sunset, I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. You've all disappointed me greatly. Fannie. A single mamma in the city. After I left the army, I bought a 9-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out "worm" means something else out there. And, I am now in the business of... pain management. Or, the smoking of pain management. Snap out of it. Dwight? No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. Are you crazy? Look. I, I don't want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain... sort of sophistication. Totally. Yep. The people here are like [makes farting sound, laughs] Like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart? Uh, somehow how I think a couple of nights could hurt. That doesn't work on me. By the way, that's not... Very funny. OK. Oui, oui, oui. Oh my goodness. [after following Dwight to the chicken coop, before sunrise] Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them? I was just asking you something I didn't know. [after grabbing an egg] Are we gonna eat these today? Is that a guillotine? [referencing goat] That's a cow? [after seeing Dwight smelling milk] What are you doing now? I don't know. I don't know any of that. Not it. Yeah. What? Well there you go. That's muy caliente. What the hell?! You can have this back at the end of the day. [cut to Andy listening to the iPod and looking aroused, water is dumped on him] Oh!! What's her name? Sweet. Oh yeah. Keep talkin'. Oh. The same thing that you think. Let's go to the conference room. I bet she does. I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth. Yes. Fine office you have here. Sturdy walls. Let's talk terms. If you agree to a forty sixty split on this tractor, I'll store it in one of my barns. Esther, get in the truck. 19, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!"[reading] "He's not hawt, he's gay." [typing] "Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again." [reading] "He is hawt!" See, thank you, that's more like it. "He is butt." God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh! Standard. Hey, can I talk to you for one second? One second. One second. Don't do it. [takes Dwight's pen] Dude, we're being conned. These chicks are way too hot to be into us. Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor. Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her. I don't even know what an auger is! Hey, you ready to sign? We're gonna get him. A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours. Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way. Dwight, we need to talk. Look, we're gonna have the tractor for the same amount of work days but my dad is planning on leasing it to the Vanderkirk brothers on the weekends. So you're going to be paying more, but he's putting on ten times the miles and he's pocketing a profit behind your back. You need to tell him you want a deal based on miles or he can just stick that tractor where the sun don't shine. Mmhm. Of course. [laughs] You didn't just think I was tractor bait, did you? Hey Dwight, what's an auger used for? I don't know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, "Red Alert." "In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There's Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get." [walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can't you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee? Son, you've lost your mind. I'm not going anywhere until you fix my elevator. All right, if I have to be the good wife, I'll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I'm a better wife than that. [sighs] Yeah, come on in. I'm just on hold with another talent agency. It's insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there's more. 251. 252. I can't even keep up! [grunts intensely] I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That's final. Yes! I'm sorry I'm being curt, it's just I'm about to land a top talent agent. [on the phone] Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory. Hey, Dwight. Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next? Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a thr*at to be credible, you ha— No, you didn't. Sick of you and your—ooh— [falls to the floor with a loud thud] Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren't those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him? You gave him three sh*ts. All right. Move it! One, two, three. [grunts] We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something. Yes. Any good weekend plans? Nice. Uh, I don't know yet. I was thinking about... And then what? Well, if I may, you're a natural. That's a little weird. I know. Evel Knievel. [connect helmet straps around Stanley's head] That's about as good as that's gonna be. Catch? I can't catch him. He's like, 250 pounds. Blunt? Dude, this size of my haunches— [Stanley's body slips down the stairs and his head thumps into a wall] We should probably call a doctor or something, dude. [gags] We can't just leave him bubble wrapped like this. That's actually really smart. God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge. Hey, wait, wait, how—how are we doing this? Just say "arms" and "legs," okay? That just—that's the vernacular that I'm comfortable with. [sighs] Wha—What's a shank? It's by the tenderloin. All right. Yeah—yup yup. What? Aw, come on. Damn it. Pigeons. Isn't the client, like, best friends with his sister? [whispers] That they do. Stanley, what is going on here? Driving. Ooh-hoo, look at that baby... Very special little boy. Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, he'll go, "eee." A beautiful family. [laughs] Right? Come on! So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it? Oh, no, I'm not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up. [stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground] [grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz. Who's pumped for the quarter finals, huh? I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer. Yes! Uh huh. Oh man. This is flatter. Nice. Tom Brokaw! Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther] No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck. Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals. Whoo! Hey. Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow. [to Dwight] Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman? Oh. Is she a gambler? I believe I want to go home. Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes. Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight. We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely. [Angela looks disgusted] I guess. Smasher! Smasher? No, where'd you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city's best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts. I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don't spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt. Fireball! I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts. It's not a large room, I think they heard me. That's really ok. I'm mostly focused on the belt here. Hold it—Take a step back. Take a step back. [they bow, then Dwight thrusts again] Okay, okay. I can't—I can't do this if you're gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we're gonna have to cut this off. Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying. Congratulations. Okay. Yes, I will. [Dwight starts doing karate] Yeah, I'm watching. Just do it. I'm watching. Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam. All I'm saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager's chair. And I thought you wanted that job. You come so prepared. Aspirin. Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It's really great. No. He was maybe thinking of you for it. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Just saying. Well, hello. Big day for you. Love the belt. You know, I don't know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog's outta here, so letting it all hang out! Thank you, I appreciate that. ‘Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it. No, I just applied for more overdraft protection. [cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney. Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please? Will you be the new manager? Where? Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let's go. It's good news. What? Why do you already have this? I know. Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute— I don't think so. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on—what I was about to say was Dwight—[phone buzzes] Oh, I'm sorry, I gotta—This'll be a second, sorry. Yeah. [on phone] Then we'll get him a new set of drums. [hugs Dwight] Congratulations, Dwight. [hugs Dwight] Congratulations, buddy. Congrats, Dwight. But I fought for this seat. It's nice to have you back. So. Let's hear it. Nope. Can't accept that job. It's not a real job. I'll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I'd be proud to take. Don't get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus. Hey, I didn't get a chance to say it, but... congratulations, Dwight. This is a big day for you. Tuna, I'm a performer. And perform I shall. [sings ‘I Will Remember You'—everyone is slightly impressed] Oh, Angela. But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office] The tea in Nepal is very hot. Close. Colder. No, I meant you're getting colder. The correct response is, "the coffee in Peru is much hotter." But, that's three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol? No, no. Give me the steam. It's just harmless steam to panic intruders. I'd like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd. Go get ‘em, honey. Oh, don't worry. They'll get got. Sales form for you to sign. Aw, thanks, man. No. When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he's giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he's certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim. He welcomes you. Your agenda-taking pleases him. [overlapping] Zero. No nonsense. You can't have nonsense. Hi, buddy. my wife did it. Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It's all about Phillip. I hate Phillip. I love Star Wars as much as the next guy— I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN. Potential future nonsense. I'm gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You've got a regional manager. Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager. But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager? Exactly. Yeah, right. I mean, unless they're willing to pass some tests. Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table? Members of the office, hear ye. Plop? Still? Nice. This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that's for fueling only. No savoring. He envies you. 985,000,000,000,017. Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World. Come on.Jim & Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna—Jim & [reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went." An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right? Yeah. It's real. It's the only way you'll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She's through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful! Look at that form. You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing—none of these people are good enough. What I'm about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I've ever said. Is- The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute. I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That's it. You look really, really good. I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond. All day long, it's moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs. Dwight, I'm telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight? The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm. You threw the summoning bag at me, sir? Perform a test. Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I'm gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don't worry, he's the best in the biz. Unless you think he can't handle it. Mama. Mama. Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager's office before? Beet. Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don't know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple. Hey. You wanted to see me? I am sorry he's here today but I had— How thoughtful. If he is your son, that's a great plan. But he's not. He's not your son. Can I go back to my desk now? Well I've been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn't believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help. OK, I don't have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so. I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so cr*ck the whip. What do we got? Wow! Congratulations, that's a really big step. Right in the sweet spot. I think you're gonna be really happy. [whistles] That's a lot of pros. So what is the problem? I don't know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I've been faced with a tough decision, there's only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation. Love. no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who's gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have. Not as good as you. Oh, my goodness. Dwight? Why? [getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem! Who drives like that? Can you put that down? It's too loud. Okay, yes—yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you! And I lied to you. Phillip's your son. I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.  We're getting bonus footage for the DVD. It'll be a pledge gift. PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you. In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I'm getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there's a mini-reunion. A kind of a "where are they now" panel at a local theatre. It'll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven't seen Kevin since we let him go. Speech! Yes! Wait, why? "Get out." What does that mean? What? Dwight, you can't do that. What?! Dwight...[overlapping objections] Yeah. Yeah, I don't think... I think she looks good. Now that she's wearing sports bras, we don't see her boobs as much. Thank you. [laughing] To remind you that our wedding's gonna be wonderful. D, it's gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me. I don't...I don't know why. Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He's putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I've done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight...only good surprises. "Guten Pranken". [chuckles] Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn't going to show up? No I didn't change the number. All good though. Phone never rings. Surprise! You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town? WASSUUUUP! [laughing] Get out. No, Dwight. You'll be doing the whacking. Of course I did. OH! [all laugh and applaud after Dwight fires the bazooka] Yeah, brosef. They do. Here we go! Right there. I bet you boys have a big appetite. Mm, I know what you want. I know exactly what you want. Ohh, shh. [places finger over Dwight's lips] [Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It's o...thank you. You know what? You don't have to...oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It's okay. Dwight, for the last time, she's not a waitress. If you want her to leave, just tip her. What's happening? Oh, it's the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela's been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled. They think it was Mose. What is that? Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town? Is that Mose? If you want your bride, buy us a drink! If you want your bride, buy us a drink. Well, well, well, well, well, well. That's six "wells." Did I get that number right, Dwight? Yes. I did. This one. Now get out! Ooh. Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet. Well, w... I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow's his wedding day. You can't be anything but happy on your wedding day. You're just saying that to make me feel better. Is that all it was? Come here [hugs Dwight] I missed you! Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three. You've had your drink. Now where is my bride? Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or... It's like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It's kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn't wanna know any of it. You ready? Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um... I don't know how to tell you this, but... we have a little bit of a problem. The minister just told me that it's tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom. I haven't heard of it, obviously. But I'm out because I am significantly younger than you- I think it's definitely... Well, okay. Either way... Either way, Dwight... I can't be there for you. I'm sorry. I just...really wish there was something I could do. [looks off] That's not... Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They'll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just s*ab ‘em on in there.[After Dwight and Angela's dance] Thank you go much. Great. It was really fun. If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it's that if you film anybody long enough, they're going to do something stupid. It's only human natural. Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again? And Jim can jump back in without skipping a b*at. We'll come back to visit. But I think it's time for us to officially... Dwight, come on. Don't end on a bad note. Hey, and if you're ever in Austin... There it is.
