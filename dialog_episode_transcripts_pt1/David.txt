[English accent] Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate. English? Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct? I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi... It's called Reginald Pooftah. Michael Scott. [laughing] I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping! No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality. That's good. Pleasure to meet you. Dunder Mifflin. No, not right now. All right. See you around. Hey... David Wallace! Hey, how are you? No, got canned last week. No, best thing that ever happened to me. Yikes! Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house] You got a minute? I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin. Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today. Hey! Is it true you're buying the company? What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager? But it's- it is- it is me? Right? What? Oh my God! Wow. From janitor to manager? That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P. Can we expect any payroll interruptions? So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore? Oof. [laughs] Wouldn't wanna be a Sabre employee right about now. [laughs] I'm actually the CEO. Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess. Likewise, I'm Bob. Bob Kazamakis. I'd love to give you a little rundown on what I've learned about this place. All right, you sly bastard. When can you start? Ouch. That's gotta hurt! David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women. David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm. [answering phone] Dwight Schrute. [turns on speakerphone] Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town? Hi, David. Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don't know where I'd put you. Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There's a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing "the White Whale". Look at all that sweet blubber. So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account? Shhh! [clears throat] Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me! I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly. Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I'm gone. Yep. I resent that. I, I never lied to you. And all was good in Scranton PA that day. Oscar says "hi" all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. "Hi" "Hello" "Hola" You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say "hi"? But you're calling me a liar. By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately. Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] "Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick." Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED! This has been a really tough time. Yeah. Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard. It was like a security blan- You're not? That's awesome. David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it. Crystal.
