Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face. See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It's Clark and, um— In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop. Cause you're always taking dumps. You a sports fan? Oh. Any team sports? Phillies fan, though, right? No, like baseball. A baseball team. Why do you want this cat? How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions? Have you taken any concrete steps? I can't use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I'll be launched into space. God, you're so insensitive. Allergies. [as Pete and Clark enter office] Oh, Pete, you've got mail. Yeah, I'm alternating. [gestures both men] Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time. [looking down at Erin's desk] Wow, Newsweek, huh? This election... thing is crazy, right? Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It's not a nice letter. Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind. Think it over. [punches Pete] Yeah, industry secret. You're gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back. Pff. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then. Buy Erin some sexy, fun outfits. [whispering to Pete] Whatever it takes. Heh! Ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe Nellie's hand] [Darryl enters, sees what's happening, and quietly exits] Oh. Oh god. Tuh. [to Pete] What're you doing here? Uh, Pete, you wanna take Erin to get a burger or something? Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...I'm related to Michelle Obama.[Clark and Peter clap] It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome. Daraas! [asks the rest of the office] Does anyone here have fermented mare's milk? Azem choma! Chomakka-attun! Do not care. Ooh! [To Pete. Crying sounds come from behind Nelly's curtain] British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right? Broccoli Rob was Broccoli Rob. Andy Bernard is the Boner Champ. Buts... are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or Andy will flip out... And make it a surprise, please. [to Pete] This isn't stupid. Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen. Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. [laughs] He's seriously juvenile. Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops. Erin I gotta go![Walt begins playing] Them's my chords! Thanks for covering the phones. Fine. Does he have a flipper? He sounds like an idiot. Ok. Thanks. I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I'm helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I've ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong. Nice! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look. Fine. I will show you one... slide show. Uh! Sorry, I uh, just saw your face. I know. That's great. It just - it makes it look like there's an eyebrow in the middle of your face. A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn't bad. But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It's such a great cause. This is gonna be awful. Make it go taller. No, not taller this way, taller this way. [gesturing with hands] You're not getting this, Peter.  Make it go wider... up! Obviously. He's a sweet kid, Darryl. But he's not the sharpest guy in the drawer. That's what I'm talkin' about. Yep, yep, yep. Let's find out what I did. [talking into phone] I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so... yeah, we're good. Yeah. [exhales] We dodged a b*llet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye. [cheers and applause] Well, yeah, what can I say, a player's gotta play. What did I just say? What did I just say? Yeah. No. Jim... [wine bottle clangs on plate] [cheers and applause] Whoo! Um,. it's empty. [into phone] Hello, this is Pam Halpert. I'm calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say... your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, "Hey, kool-aid." Yeah, your mama's fat. This is Pam Halpert. You did good. You did good. Oscar. [cheers and applause] I did not know that. Wow. Right. Wait, German t*rrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain. I haven't seen it. Mm-Mmm. "now, i have a machine g*n. Ho, ho, ho." Oh, yeah, and when he takes the g*n off his back, and he's like, "Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--" Yes, you are right. Forgive me. Nope. [Kevin walks out the door into the kitchen] [Points and Pete] Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie? Okay, let's hear it. Die hard. Every line. Go. Don't change the subject. I wish my car had a bathroom. [On a computer, checking the script] Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete. [Reading the email from Andy] "What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates."[Erin walks back to Pete and sits down at the computer] So what comes next? We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense. No. No more talking. It's movie time. Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan. Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. [Texts warehouse worker, Nate, to forget showing up as zwarte piet][Nate starts walking towards the door, gets the text, and walks back to his car][Pete and Erin watching die hard on a computer] Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me? [Sliding away from Pete] I'm still Andy's girlfriend. Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete? Well, wait. You're up. You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out. Okay. Okay. [rinsing Pete's hair out] Is that too cold? I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off] I guess so. Hi guys! I usually take a siesta about now. [shouts while cutting up seat cushion - gasps upon finding playing cards] And then we had him "Like" Dunder Mifflin. Press "End." Oh, my gosh! Wow. That guy's really into paper. We did it. Youth task force forever. Yes. No, you go -- okay. Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that's the end of it. Right, Pete? I haven't told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he's always like, "Beesly!" I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- "Beesly!" [chuckles] Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it. Nope. [to Pete] Hey! Wanna play hookey today? I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend. [has an idea and reveals a frisbee from under her desk] Wanna play catch in the parking lot? Great. Hey! Hi. I couldn't do it. I'm sorry. Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army. She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about? Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first. Pete what? No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic. Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted [reading computer screen] shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh? I knew it! You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa! No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired! Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can f*re anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. [singing] So you had a bad day- ..The camera don't lie! You're being an idiot get.. Out of my office, turns out you're fired... Because you suck. And you're fired... So you had a bad day... Rut ti doh doh... Rut tit doh doh... You wrote Art and Painting, kinda the same thing. Kinda the same thing. Sometimes I repeat myself, but that's just being Pam. Well I'm kinda cute and I'm- but I'm married so...leave that be. penis. Translation? My manhood. Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in. See? We can all be friends! Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward. Pete? What, do you two know each other? That's so random. Was he like the sexy librarian? Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with? Awkward. [high pitched] Really uncomfortable situation. No. How are you doing? Is it really rough? And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch. Ok, while we're rewriting history, you never had a drinking problem. So you're dating a secretary now? Moving up in the world, Pete. I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle. What kind of music are you into, Peter? Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan? I wasted two years of my life on you, you realize that right?! I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues] My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more [Angela and Oscar make disgusted faces] I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone. Brian? You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams. [on the computer screen] I'll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy h*m*. You know what, this is completely unnecessary. You already won... What? Dammit! Dammit, god. [To Pete] Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I'm really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels. Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win! Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark. Oh, wow. But, um—Oh, I get that. I get it. [sits at Dwight's desk] Got any hot leads? I'm back. Oh, hey, look, and now it's like a double date. That means ye, Plop! We owe Andy that much. Am I right people? That's exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing? Ew, the exact opposite, actually. With today's modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it's our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were. You have to go, Toby. Yeah. I'll stop by.
