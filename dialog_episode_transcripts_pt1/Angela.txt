[screams and jumps out from behind copier] Cut! Got it! Very authentic looking. Amazing. We needed a real reaction for the scene to work and we got it. Congratulations. [To Erin] You're amazing. [To Angela] You are so good! [screams] Still behind. I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right. Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye. Copy. Thank you. It's working. I'm doing it! What? Do you have your card? Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing] And scene. Give me the punch card. That is not in the contract. Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape. Thank you. [whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy. Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss. Thank you. You, too. [steals a bottle of wine from the bar] Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model? [during curtain call for Sweeney Todd] Boo! Boo! All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good m*rder. All right, let's do this. It's okay, I smell. No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have sex. I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card] [nods to camera] Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is? Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up? Josh Duhamel. This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits. Oh. Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar. Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam? Angela as the nurse! The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever. Wow. We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people. Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all. Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby! [reaching into her purse] Give me the baby! [to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela. [gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby? [sighs] They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats. And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible. Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch. She loves me. [knocking on Angela's car window, Angela is naked inside] Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight! I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone. Yes! I have been so authorized. Okay. You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a- Drama Queen? 00. Come on in, enjoy! Roll in the hay, five dollars. Oh, our contract. Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil. I entered the sale, and I h*t enter, and I said, "dunh-duh-na-dah!" I'm pretty sure I timesed it right. What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap? Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose. [waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut] Uh, can we move this to the end of the day? Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing. Do you mind if we share this bale? There's no charge to sit on the hay, is there? I mean, wouldn't you think the ten dollars to build your own broom would include the hay and not just the instructions? I mean, I'm starting to think this guy is just trying to make money off the holiday. No, no, no, I wasn't--I was just laughing at your joke. Pay Place. That's humorous. So, if I were to call Dunder Mifflin and ask for Miss Angela Martin, would I get through to you? My wife passed away a few years ago. Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes. Oh my God, I can't look at roaches. We can move out. Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem? Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party. State senator. Who are you dating in the public arena? Oh, right. The state senator. Well... Cancel. We're canceling it. [Michael starts to throw away all of the food] No, we have to cancel the party. We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. [imitating Sean Connery] The name is Bond... Santa Bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow! [camera pans down to Angela pinning Michael's pants] Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa. Okay. Sure. You never know about the press. Could he help us with some parking tickets? Well, then he's not a senator. I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. [clip of Michael throwing Holly's Woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it] It is Christmas. And the game's over seconds later. It's nice. I know. [Angela hands Creed a pack of deodorant] For me? Thank you very much. Mmhmm. I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work. The real problem is the teachers' union. Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender? Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito. Annoying. Okay, so k*lling yourself. [laughs] I was just thinking about snot. Wow. Did your baby draw that? Angela. Who's the senator? Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'. Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman. I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it! Yeah, who wrote it? Aww, nuts. [laughs] Yes! The freaking PDA! Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them. Yes, yes, absolutely. I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because... [groans] As has Angela! As has Kevin! You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone. That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves p*ssy cats, and Packer loves- Easy no. Kind of embarassing. Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them. I did not. PB and J, my mom's recipe! [throws sandwitch at Phyllis] Mmhmm. [in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes? What's wrong with cupcakes? We thought. [walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?! Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point? Brava! Sure! Who's that? Who's that guy? [points to second guy in the pictures] I guess this could be the one, huh? [quickly] Erotic. I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop. Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said. He's good at his job. And I like working for him. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell. I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell. And I wrote my own companion piece to the "vag*na Monologues" called the "Penis Apologies." So I know a thing or two. Yes! I'm in. Someone want to sit in Kevin's lap? Angela? ...indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [Kevin finishes behind the rest of the group] Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time? I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms? Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day. Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office] Another one?Darryl and Yes! Could you turn the volume down on the beeping? Nine first. Thank you. Nice. Oh, I h*t three. I h*t three. How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system? Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met. [looks at ring, whispering] Wow... Yeah! Tell us a story. [laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person? That's not accurate. Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... [clips jumps ahead] Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though. I'll get over it. That was our dream wedding. [looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela. What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right? Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office. Wait, when did we start calling it that- Well, I am a few months ahead of you. Shhh, Pam. C'mon, don't be such a right-sider. [door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch? Night. No, guys. He's fine. No he hasn't. No! She looks at it when she's on the potty, and she makes the faces. I flipped through it. Yeah. That sounds nice. Um, what should we talk about? Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help. Angela, that's pretty transparently me. You know it's just herbal tea. Yeah. I think you should call social services. You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we're in this together. Oh, thank you. Wait, wait. What's this? [holds up clipboard] It says "Lotto Pool", right on top. [points to obvious title] I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy. Nope. Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier. Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather. [giggling] Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather. I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress? I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert! Oh, I put those up. I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so... Oh. Yeah. I'm on it. Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made. Got it. Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty. Nuh uh. Andy. [alert sounds] 45. There's only 15 minutes left. [gags, coughs] Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is- Who's spotting who? Don't use the bike in the corner. That's Bruce's. Jeremy says... How can we do that? She's simply wonderful. Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist. Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute. I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply! Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks] Whoa. Yes! [they high five and jump in the pool] You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets f*re to paper ring boat] Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door] Hi! You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby. I'm going to call him Little Kevin. Is he really five pounds? No, no, no, he's nine pounds, seven ounces. Well, if it's anything like that gorgeous wrapping paper, you h*t it out of the park. Again, it may not be the right size. I can return- stickle. Honestly, I can return this for a larger size. The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate. [giggles] Little Kevin. Angela. I knew that, I knew it. Chicken marsala. Mm-hmm. Yes I did. That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine. Oh, that's my cue to leave. Still. Still. Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me. Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding? You said that Robert was not fulfilling you- -and I said, "I bet I could fulfill you," and you said, "I'd like to see you try," and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls. And then I inserted my penis- Into your- vag*na and- Admit that there is a chance. Admit it. Admit it. Mmm. Before I go, may I? [laughing] Well, it's not exactly a vacation. What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago. Angela, you look amazing. Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too. When did you find time to do all this? Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good. Hey! Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch. Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us? Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby. Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course. No, three-month-old humans don't do that. Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again. Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no. We're good to goooo! Say- Eight Cases, bright white inkjet. That's messed up. [in voiceover] Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past. Hey, I was on the can. What's this about a black guy in the office? No. And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area. Look, I don't feel safe. I think we should call the police. It's interesting that you're drawn to the point of view of the attacker.  You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu. Okay. Good point... I was a twelve year old bully. Yeah, that's not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression. I don't know if this is gonna help...Uh... He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever. Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful. No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed. Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager. Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face? Phyllis! Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone] Listen to this. Or what if... We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean. No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst? Cheers. Angela! Dock Andy's pay one hundred dollars. Angela, two hundred dollars! No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis] What is this? I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help. That was really cool. [they make out] Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing. Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's? Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine. Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see. Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me. Oh. Oh, I'll tell you what he does. [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don't worry, I won't lay an egg. Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs] Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel? Hello, Erin. Hello, everybody. [laughs] Yeah. Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela. Sure. No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day. I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with. Oh, thank you. Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me- Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well? Oopsie, did somebody make a boopsie? Okay, shall we take a few more? Okay. There we go. Gosh, I hope so. Hi, Angela. I'm not supposed to say. Hello. They're testing it now. Seventy-two hours. Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand] Mr. Schrute, the results are in. You are not the father. In a way it's like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they'll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I'll have a grandson. Angela's cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can't eat cats. You can't eat cats, Kevin. I'll take him. I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle! No, I'm a dog person. You should ask him. It's a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy. Definitely no. Come here, I'll show you. I don't want it, really. I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night. Why are you getting rid of it? Your husband? You know what? I will take Comstock. I'll come by after work and pick him up. C'est la vie. American Diabetes Association. That's all right. What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie? [as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos. Uh-huh. [while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie? Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or... I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol' family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States. Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela's throat] Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying] Oh sorry! Sorry. It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest. At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare. Everybody! Hang on! [Dwight pulls out quickly] A jitterbug. [giggles] You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions? Not a question. Spring sing ‘95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way. Nice to see you Oscar. Ouch! Right on target. Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome. What happened? Yeah, I think this day could get worse. Ok. [signs paper] thanks. I... did not. [laughing in Oscar's direction] Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom! Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper? That's a tough one. Please, stop. Please, stop. Well, I am sorry Kevin. You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters] No. [to passing female pedestrian] Smile if you love men's prostates. Hi. More like fall cleaning. [chuckles] [dropping desk drawer] This doesn't... I'm sorry. Wha... what? I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela's husband spoon me back to bed. Oh, I'm sure ...that's nothing. Angela, Blake's also a guy's name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake? I just never heard about the senator and yoga... From you. I'm sure it's probably nothing. But what's with the yoga already? And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out. Little of this, little of that. Angela! [whispering] Angela. There. [whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her. She's repositioning his hips for downward facing dog. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... [whispering] I'm so sorry. I hate this. You're better. [stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs] [whispering] Please. It's Robert who's enjoying it. Uh, what does -- what does that mean? I don't know, Angela. I'm dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go. He's making a phone call. Good morning. [clears throat] [whispering] Of course, ask me a que--  questions. [hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes. It's the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I'm gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I'll just go downstairs. One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they're in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information's already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to "chillax," and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don't give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house.  Fight the power. Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you. Come on in, the water's fine. I know. That's not why I'm naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks] Oh, I'm sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I'm not in your panties, I don't go vigilantes. Why don't you ask your husband? [sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping? Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force. I can try. I'm gonna use SMS text. Text went through. All we can do is sit and wait. Huh? Get in the van. Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don't see them so I think we're good. I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out, I'm damn good at it. You tell me. It's the receipt for my g*n. And that's all off the books? Nice. No taxes. So what's the job? You can't have someone m*rder. What did they do to you, Angela? No! No! That's very effective. I've been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. It's devastating. No! You're not helping, Trevor! No. Angela! What are you saying? I'm trying, but what you're asking is-- I brought you a cookie. [chanting] "Pam!" The target-- it's Oscar, isn't it? He and the senator are gaying each other. Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you're engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils. Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger's knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend? I can't even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me. What do you mean? I am Oscar Martinez. Wha-- wh-- You hired someone to h*t me with a pipe! What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him! Angela, until you face that, you're gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won't stop you. h*t me. you have my blessing. h*t me. Angela, it's a lead freaking pipe. Aah! Yeah! You're not stupid. Jazz is stupid. I know. You're gonna be okay, Monkey. That is-- that is a loaded question. He said that? I-- I don't know if there's truth to-- to, uh, to that. Oh... uh... We heard it was called red-vining. Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone! So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us? Well, you are the one in charge of it. No. Done, right? We already said no. I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy? Yes! Phyllis! What does that even mean? Where would your name appear? [Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. "Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany." We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.[Kevin dressed up as Santa, helps Angela down from hanging lights] Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice! Stop that! Next! Lice. More lice. [Angela shrieks in disgust] Angela has lice. Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her. To be washed. No, all we need is mayonnaise. [walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!? Take a picture. It will last longer. Oh! Uh, uh I'll go. Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up. [Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela. Now, don't worry, don't worry. I'm on my way to pick her up, but you might have lice too. You know, lice can be tricky. Sometimes lice, like...[Pam hangs up phone] Meredith, I am so sorry. [Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow! You're waterboarding me! Alright everybody, who's in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don't make us come over there. Alright, let's go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela] No way. Yes! [giggles and picks up Angela] One! [as he picks Angela up in the air] Two... [picks Angela up again] That's enough Kevin. That's enough! It's insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too! Well I can't stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me. I saw the leaves twitch! Yeah! [with horns honking] Kevin, can- "Higher than numbers go." The ceiling above accounting! Oh, no, Kevin, it's not a joke. Angela's husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind. No, let's-- let's-- let's not say Creed. Let's say Mr. X. Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't you cheat on Andy? Anyone want to see the video from Cece's recital? User error. I've heard of that happening to other people. Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point. And our training included picking carrots, scrubbing tubs, sewing imitation Levi's. A lot of telemarketing. I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together... [sees mural] Oh my god! [camera pans to mural with butts painted over it] Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts? [to warehouse crew] Huh? No way. No way! Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids. Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation... [undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too. He said he wanted me there for support. Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me. [enters quickly] You need my pitchfork? What is it? I have vengeance to exact. Ah, I'm not interested. Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you? OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for coming. Phillip had no idea he was so popular. Hold on a second. Uh, Sandeep? Let's get you closer to the senator. Just about there. Great. And, Oscar? I'm gonna need you to step a little closer to the senator, as well. Somewhere there. He put me here. Yes. Sorry about that. Oh... [approaching Accounting] Hey, everybody, great job. [to Angela] Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks. All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela's desk] Who's that little fella? Uh-huh. [Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you. And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes. It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs. You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was "poisoned" by Aunt Shirley. Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was. Thank you. Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out- And there's parts of her I don't even recognize. There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap. It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know? It's a divet... ..where it was and it needs, it needs a... Oh, lookie here. It's big city Dwight. Careful you don't get mud on those fancy town shoes, big city Dwight. You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit. How would you like a mean cold slap? [slaps Angela] Ok. Yeah, trust me. Bye. Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down. It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose. Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off. Let's get to it. Give it a whirl. I need you to hose my aunt. OK you are useless. Give me the hose! Ahh! OK! Yes ma'am. Ow! The braid is too tight. Yes ma'am. Ok. And you look like one too. Thank you Angela. By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela? Would you like the stink sack? No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack. So, when's the wedding? Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you. Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse. Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey. I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you. Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine. Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart? I am. It was my rock bottom. Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right? Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. [after noticing Angela easting cupcake] Hey! [as others eat] Wait! [exits office, chewing] Oh my god. I forgive him so much. [Kevin begins making choking sounds] Whoa, is he choking? Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned? Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand. Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak. God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air. Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes. [Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction] Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots. Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper. Thank you. [Dwight kisses her forehead] Cool. Superhero. "Three PM Girl" Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it? Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified] Meredith! Hey. "You guys are k*lling it!" I mean, we're internet sensations guys! Ok everyone, turn off your mikes. Cheers. They caught us kissing on Halloween. Oh! Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy! Well, I don't like giving him bad news. You call him! Stop hitting me! Oh you? Hey, Hey Robert! Hey. Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos. Very much so. Absolutely. Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay. I think that's it! Done! Ok! Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I'll hold. I'm sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye. [hangs up phone] Don't worry. I've scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the camera together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on. [surprised chatter] They make a nice couple. Alright. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this. [holds up large check for $2,000] Whoa. Oh please. [Dwight watches Angela folding paper airplane] [cries] Come here, come here. Let's go. No. [clapping] Whoo! Come on Clark! You can do it baby! Yes! Toby and Angela. Well, Angela is the winner. After you. Alright. Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me. [To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely. [noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok? Wait, all of them? That's—that's awful, Angela. I'm so sorry. I've never met anyone like that. Angela, you still have your son. He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt. Thank you. Yeah, and Dwight, I'd like to be the first to say congratulations. Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood! Eleanor Roosevelt once said ‘the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.' [clip of him flipping off David Wallace] I think she's right. [clip of David Wallace yelling at Andy to get out] I feel calm now. [clip of Andy taking a dump on a car] I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I'm doing the right thing. Yeah. Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don't squash my knickety-knacks on top. Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too— But I just—it's in the past. And I feel like we shouldn't... Rehash— Exactly. Thanks, Angela. You too. [whispering] You okay? Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar. Wait a minute. You're not thinking of living in a— Okay, I'm just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent. Come stay with me. I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won't be long. It's the least I could do. Separate bathrooms. You're welcome. Let's go get Phillip. Then we'll get your stuff... And get you the hell outta that place. I know. And I can't do it. No, it's neat and tasteful, like most gay men's homes. The stereotype holds up. Angela, you just were— I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You—you can't— Angela, someone wants you. [as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on? Why? Andy. What's yours? Guys. Guys. Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says "bold front" instead of "cold front"? It's insane. Seriously, Kevin. I'm just gonna have to go to the store. I don't care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though. Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise] No, I don't need this! And you obviously don't need me. He just won't go down. It's as if he's excited by all this paper. Okay, I guess, it's just that Phillip got you something. I think there's, like, $7 left. That was a really cool move. What a chubbers. Whoa. I'm losing my balance. No horseplay. You wanna play with the cactus? Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer] Door. Chair. It's about Phillip. I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal. Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let's face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet. Very well. All right, Meredith. Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother's, and I'll meet you at Poor Richard's in an hour. She doesn't know I'm living with a straight woman. I don't want to get her hopes up. [in bullhorn] Pull over! Move to the side of the road! Pull over! What do you—Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over] [on bullhorn still] Shut up, woman! Listen to me! I love you! And I don't care that Phillip's not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you! This expresses how loudly I love you. [puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites. I love you! What? What? Why would you say that— [excited] Get out! I'm a dad! [whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding? [after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for? Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old g*ng gone. Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him. Where's my angel. No, this is my big sister Angela. [speaks in a special language] Whoo! Angela's special repairman is here. oh, wowee wow. Whoo-hoo...go, Meredith's stripper son. I don't know! I don't know. Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela] Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey. What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right? It's just the wind. Okay. [opens door] It's just the wind, see? Nothing. Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk] Let me help you us. Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high. Hey guys. What about the honeymoon? I still have my medal from that. [whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding? [after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for? Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old g*ng gone. Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him. Where's my angel. No, this is my big sister Angela.
