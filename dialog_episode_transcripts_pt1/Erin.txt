32[ The Third Floor, Webisode 01 - "Moving On" ][music playing] Thanks Erin. But you know it only got two views. You know what I think it is? I think that music and dance are dead. It's everywhere. You know, I turn on the TV and someone is just like, singing in my face. Lady Gaga or some four-year-old is crying because Lady Gaga won't be their mom or whatever? It's just too much. I think it's just time that we move on. Oh, I'm not giving up on fame. I mean, we're gonna still be famous. Performing isn't necessarily the only way to express yourself. For example, I write poetry. In a book. No more singing and dancing for us. [singing] We've got our outlet.[ The Third Floor, Webisode 02 - "Lights, Camera, Action!" ] She gave me a heart att*ck! But it does say that you can not bring w*apon into work... Hello? Is anybody here? I have never seen anything like it. It has the right arm of Lizzie Borden, the left arm of Jeffrey Dahmer, the heart of Jack the Ripper and the legs of all the serial K*llers who ever got away. You can't bring w*apon into work, so... Haven't you heard? During renovations, we added a basement, making this the third floor. No, no, no, no! Oh God No. Oh, Thank God. I'm safe. I'm safe. [screams] Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there. And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher. I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite. God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son. Because I wanted you to come to me and say, "Wow, he is so great." And I was gonna say, "Well, it's in the genes." And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is. Let's just make this kid open this damn car. This kid's costing us sales, Michael. We should start our own mall! Who can I speak to in this office about saving on window treatments? Thank you. Dwight [snaps a picture with a disposable camera, then drops the camera in the trash can] Yes! [as other costumed actors come in and join Andy in song] No. Steven Sondheim. Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton's Miss Fitness pageant. Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men can't resist a man singing show tunes. Everyone. She's babysitting? [excited] That's really irresponsible of Erin. She's a terrible babysitter. What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way. Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or... You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. No, we're good. Thank you, though. Are you ready? [pretends to slit her throat] Ah! Blood everywhere. Yeah, me, too. These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here. Awesome. See you later. [walks into the office with a large, fake mustache on] Good morning Erin, any mustaches? I mean messages? So, guys. I've been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we're better than that. Ok, now I'm going to show you a picture of genitalia. [grossed our remarks from around the office as Andy holds p a picture of a nude man] Ok, umm. I'll move that. Thrill of risk. Yes! Thank you! Such as? The Sting. The Sting. Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave. [pointing to Danny] Don't leave. Don't let him. The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore. I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a b*llet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now... Okay. We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that? If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be? An asset! [reaches over to pull Erin out of apple bobbing water] ERIN! One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough. Gah! [getting off the bus] Wait for me! [bus drives away] Don't say anything to my parents. Why quick? So it's faster. Is anyone still at the church? What? Shut up. It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies. Can I come? [silence] Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco. [collecting pebbles off the street into a jar] Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught? [old man voice] Well kiddo, I was there. I was there... And I'll tell you what. [shakes jar of pebbles] You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship. Walk with me. [confused] Okay? Cancel it! Are you still here? [to Erin] MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I'm a very busy man. I don't have time for your TV show. I'm joking. I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry. [Erin laughs] I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek. You know who my favorite character is? The invalid. [Jim makes a face] I am coming to your party. [to Erin] You're having a party at Gabe's apartment? You would? Try and keep me from coming! Try and hide it, I will track this party down! Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss? Uh huh... Big... Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night. Oh my God what song was that? [texting] What song was it? This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now! Really? Oh... Then here we are. I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! [clip of him doing pull ups in Gabe's doorway] I feel exactly like a seahorse! [Seahorse impression] Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub. So these are pizza dogs, they aren't pigs in a blanket per se. Well... He's the longest baby in this room. [confused, rushes out of the room to the room Erin's in, picks up phone, talking fast] Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it's here. Oh if it isn't the bell of the ball! [queasily] You throw a lovely party ma lady... Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose? You're four seasons in a day. [heaves] You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- [heaves again] Put if you put on a blue... [stops, is struggling] It's Spring Time in the Rockies! Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now? And I imagine things are starting to heat up? Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical. You know what Pam just save it. No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah. What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not? Why? I'm not your father. [Erin looks sad] All right. Go to your room. Go to your room young lady! You listen to me. You listen good. You are arenot, to see that boy, anymore. As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say. Oh do not raise your voice to me! Gahh, I will pull this car over! Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time. [getting copies from the color copier behind the receptionist desk] Thanks Erin. Sure. Mm-Hmm? Okay. Oh, it's okay. [colorful poster with numbers] Check this out. [examines items on the reception desk] Mmhmm, China. China. They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir. You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles] What? So much for keeping our secrets up high. Alright. What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all k*ll him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you? No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine. This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could f*re you. Yeah. [clapping] Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by 'three'. How's everybody doing today? Yeah. That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future? When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her. She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know. Hi. Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please? There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake? Would you put those out? You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life. Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away. Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you. And we did this whole stupid party for you. Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us! Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please? Hi. I'm, uh, I'm AJ. I'm here to see Holly. It's kind of a surprise. [filming video] Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly's engaged to another man, and you want to k*ll yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it's not. I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right? Happy. Sad. To soak up my tears. Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin. Sad, something to break. For you, job well done. Both sad. I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. "Hey, you think you can do my job better?" I don't know. "What's your name?" Michael. Me? Okay. I'm good. [whispering] Follow my lead. Hey, want some company? Oh, really good, I went to Portugal. No. The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it. Intercepted! Just do a cartwheel! Hey, Ryan. [taps board, makes farting noise] Yeah! No. Yup. Bye-bye. What a nice guy. Last year, I went to a seminar called "The Ten Secrets of Real Estate". Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients. [enters] [in a gruff voice] Hello, I am here for the small business seminar. Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos. Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that. "Jelp?" J-e-l-p? I don't think that's a word. I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game. You want some help? Mm-hmm. It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play "moo"? Okay, but look, you could have h*t "mood". Would have played a... A triple word. Or moon. A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that "q" right there. I picked out our movie. It's called "Suspiria". It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down. Ooh. Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes. [pulls phone back] Ah. No! [laughing] [hands phone back]. Although I must say, I will have "apoplexy" if you lose. Do you understand? "Apoplexy" is what I will have. Yes. Got it. [plays word] Oh, Oscar. Oscar? So, I won. Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch "Wall-e". Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it. Nice guy. Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement. Bye. Ok. Oh no no no. I'll be fine. marsupial. Pam, this isn't a shopping trip. Hey. There's too many brands. Where's Holly? Tootenbacher. Orville Tootenbacher. That's Michael's millionaire character that...Dwight and Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian... He just left. Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe. All right then. Someone propose a plan. Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him. And what do we have here? I dominate Valentine's Day. I practically make romance into a science. Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck. Well, get to work. The puzzle is the clue. No. What's up? Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing. But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably... Well, okay then. At least until Stanley calms down. D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy] God! Kevin! She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there. Hey, look at that. Done. I wish you well on your quest. Aww, I mean... Okay. [snorts] Ew. Okay. I'll keep working. Whoa. [softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad. [softly] That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level. Darryl is a jerk. Oh. Okay. The temp at night? Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night? Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights] How romantic is this? Right. Do you see a clue or... Oh, my gosh. Hey!Andy and No time to chat. [chuckles, sighs] Hey. I know. B-9. Maybe it's just more like, "be mine." Mm. Erin... what are you doing? I have very little patience for stupidity. I'm such a klutz! I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right? [looking at his computer, gasps] Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! [no one moves] Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. [watching a sailing video on his computer] They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. [computer is frozen, taps the top of it] This computer's a hunk of jjunk. Where did you get this?! What? Erin is that true? Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me! That's certainly opinionated. So I'm less funny than not funny at all? Honey, he's a jerk. Sounds very interesting, thank you. Why do you use your name when you use the phone? Try it without using your name. Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you? Is that good? Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work. [whispering] Change it. Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call... [laughter] Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about. Little click... [walking into the office] Good morning Erin. You have big plans for tonight? Yeah... [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay? Who's gonna see us? Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat] What's wrong? Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend? I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better! I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me. Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds! That is bull! [throws her Dundie] What? Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call.Kelly and [disappointed] Okay... [Jim is confused] I need to talk to you! Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls] Not cool man. [walks out] Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room. Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one. [leans in for a kiss] Wooo! Yeah! [parades in circles with the dog, pretends to whack Andy with it] [giving it to Andy] Okay, again. Kevin? Ahhhh... Maybe neither. Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. [Erin is smiling] And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. [kisses her head] And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime. N- Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand new executive assistant? [ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what? Oh my God, are you alright? Erin, will you call 911 please? Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself. That's on a need-to-know basis. In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so... He means the ice pack. I'm sorry. This can't wait. Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback] Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail? Well... it's just... [ringing] it messes up my rhythm. Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the g*n and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump] I think I should go the hospital. Really? You did? What hand was I holding the g*n in? What did Andy's tie look like? We have to clean this up now! Hey, guys. [puts up a poster in the break room with "IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY" on it in bold lettering] The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace. Don't even... [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!! In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with. It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child. But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out. Mm. [grunts] Augh. Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then? Bestiality. Yeah. If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle] I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them. Thank you, bye-bye. Huh? Well, I'm not saying you must hire her. If you find someone who's clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Don't mess this up, Jim. And give Dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy. Erin, what are you doing? [giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you? [giggles] Yeah. Low blow, puppet. It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F... Silence? Hey, Erin. Where'd you learn how to puppet like that? [stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes. Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That's it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet. The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he's gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it's not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It's strange. Hello. Describe your day so far. And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. It's a waste of your time. That's how every day's g*n, for everyone, since the dawn of man. can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don't know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client. Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen? No. No, no. Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one. [To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night. Erin, you don't need to call him that. It's ok E-Dog, just who called? Hello, Andy. Excellent tie. Oh! Thank you. Uh.... You can just put it down. That is very cold. Why would I.....? Why don't we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this. I've been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. [sips] Mmm.... Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman's? Looks good. Can you believe this? Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in? [Erin raises hand] [Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses] Right. My mom- So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea. And? I don't know. That's OK, we're good. Erin, how long did we order those billboards for? I wouldn't have missed it. I'd like to make a toast to the troops. All the troops. Both sides. Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin! If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through? There you go. Thank you. [faxing, Erin watching over her shoulder] What are you doing? Oh. [sends fax, Erin nods] Are you... Oh, Erin... Um, 2? No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right? Yeah. Oh, look, Pin The Wart On The Wench. How did you know I was bringing my son? So great.[Angela takes the pumpking decoration off of the window] I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y. Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it? Yeah, but no nipples. Hey. What's up? Yeah... Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG. Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call. [pretending to be on the phone] Yes. [laughs] I don't know. Mmhmm. Sweetheart. Ok where does Gabe factor in? I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine. [laughs, eventually Erin joins him laughing] Oh that would be scary! [screaming] Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!? Witch's brew? This party's tight. The fog is cool. It really looks great. You did a great job. 45? [Erin nods] Cool. That was awful. Robert I apologize. Why didn't you simply ask Andy to clarify? Asking is a very easy thing to do. You're obviously very close. [Andy and Erin look awkwardly at each other and Robert]. Oh I see. This no longer seems like my business [Robert sits]. Ok. Erin I think you know I've been dating someone. And it's getting a little more serious. She's never come by. No I didn't want her to call because I thought it would be weird. But now it's weird that she's not calling. Thirty-one. Is she Asian? Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest? [Flickering Lights] Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here. [Plays radio and the song is Closing Time by Semisonic] [alert goes off] Oh, there's one mistake. No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?! Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative. Ok, where is he? Uhm. It's not that funny. Yes! Erin. In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I'm not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me. Nobody. Just say that I'm- Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I'm going to refuse to take it. Just make up a phone call. It's not a real call. Make it up. And come and tell me. Doesn't matter what it is. I'm not going to take it. And then he's going to be like "whoa this is a really important meeting". Uh well we've been going with... Yeah. I'm sorry – I'm with a very important client. It'll have to wait. There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting. I don't think she's dead. She's not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls. Yeah. Um line 1? Okay. How do you feel? Why even read business books? We should be studying w*r. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that? You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me? [passes out hats] One for you. After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch. Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre... ...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms. Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better. No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth. Not by a long sh*t! Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar. Hunger for hamburger. Hi. Reception. Your classic one-man operation. It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable. Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her. Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer. Yeah, he's in a ladle. Let's get Jim in here. [Jim shoves out of fram in his chair, Robert looks for Jim] Where's Jim? Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual as*ault, and don't go near Gam-gam. I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be. It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her. Hi. I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy? Oh! [laughs] Oof! Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr. Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office. Oh. Spontaneous scoliosis. [both laugh] Erin, what can I get for you? Yes. Mmm. Wow. Jiminey Christmas indeed. Whoo! As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe. That's right. [laughs] Edgy impressions. How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home. Whoa! Maybe you should take a break. What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.[Dynamite by Taio Cruz plays in the background] [laughs] Thank you. OK! Yep. [leaves Jessica to talk to Erin] Hey! Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes? I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk. Ah, OK. That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something. You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something. Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back. Hey. I'm trying but you need to- Yo. And that, is how it's done. Your heart is broken. So is mine. And what? No [laughs] my god. Erin, it was great fun tonight. Take a few aspirin and a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning. Okay, done. How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about? What? What? Princess Ding-Dong, do not h*t that bell unless- We'll never have to buy meatballs again. [phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear. I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine. You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift. It's no problem. You live right near me. Andy followed you home after the Christmas party. He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you. Oh. Come on. No, I'm good. Hi. It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage. Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes. Hey. Hi. A minute would be cool. What- I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her] Where... [finds pants, looks for ring] Oh really? I don't know. Maybe not. Just come. [laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh? I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up] [giggles] Oh Dwight! You stop. No, you stop. Okay, you can stop. No, you can stop. [he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah... Damn it. We can get some chicken fights going in the pool. You're in my way! No thanks. Yeah- oh! Woohoo! Yes! I know. I could just bang you right now. [to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break. Okay. Yeah! Great! [others cheer and clap] Go! I cannot believe it either. [coughs up water] Erin, did we win? You're lying. We didn't win. Kelly, that is mine! This is mine! [Val, Erin and Kevin play with pool noodles] [Erin swims up with ring] Wow. Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine? Duh. Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night. Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you. Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, "Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance," and then you have to be like, "Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!" And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. [dances to Kenny Loggin's Footloose] Sex also works. Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system. Uh, h*t and run. I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened. Oh, did I win the pool? Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month. Got that, bimbo? Yes, he's substantial. No, you will not. Mm-hmm. I want to see the baby. Hey. Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, "perfect pork anus" which I don't mean. And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes. Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one. Uh yeah, look at that. Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later. Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too. [Andy laughs, walks away, Erin throws away her pin] Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact. Really did [Text bleep] He responded L-O-L. Well... Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee? You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality. Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in.. Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene. You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it. Safe travels. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way? Stanley! Wake up! You've got to wake up, the hotel's on f*re! [lets go] Good morning. Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man. Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car. I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming. Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it. Yup. Tallahassee, let's go. Oh! Who called it? Nothin' but net. I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in. Who's doing the presentations? Damn it! I got the surgery, what else is there to do? No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks. I don't feel like it either! What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is. What are the three pillars of retail? Ingredients. Burgers. Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies! [everyone goes for the cookies] Is it oatmeal with no raisins? I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please. Sorry, no waffles. A waffle? No. Oh, no, I didn't know. Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey. Stanley. Uhh... you know what? Just bring back those bottles! Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off. Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me. Hello, what do we have here? Right. Got that. [Metallic thud] Get down. Hey. Hey. Hey, this is fun. I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day. Yeah? Really? Yeah. We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots. Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening. There's plenty. Don't stampede. No need to stampede, sir. Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. There's plenty of Pyramids. God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I'm trying to be a good girl for once. Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here! [to Dwight] Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it. It's okay. I'll go to the Costco and search for handsome men. [laughs] Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away. Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him! [exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin. [rises from chair] Oh, here let me help. [spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred. When can I introduce you to my grandson? He's a wonderful swimmer. Shallow end, deep end. He does it all. [takes mug] Thank you. [takes a sip] Oh, what kind of tea is this? Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch. Just open the program and type in his user name. [after briefly typing] Here, type in your password. That's a terrible password. And you don't 'make a video chat', you video chat. [video chat begins, Andy's head enters the screen from the side] Hello? Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other] No. I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you. What? [waves] Hello! if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded. Good morning Erin. [driving by delivering newspapers] How are you? How's your family doing? Bye. Erin, you got a package. Did you wash your hands? [singing] Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours! Where's the ring, Lancelot? Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn. [whispering] I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause he's not that handsome. Erin, you really nailed the hot dogs today. Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know. All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you. [on phone message, singing] Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na- Touch me and I'll sue. Yeah, if I had my own-- --sorry, you go. Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say? You broke my heart too. I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time. Erin, I think you're making a big mistake right now. Andy is a nice boy. I was protecting you because I thought he was no good. But I can tell you really like him. And he's willing to lose his job for you, in this economy with Europe on the brink-- We're not your concern, sweetheart. Besides, Glenn's going to sue Home Depot. That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it. Erin! Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street] Okay. Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff. Like your toothbrush and stuff. You don't have a toothbrush? How do you not have a toothbrush? You just use whichever one is sitting there? [sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life. On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania. Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy. [sings] Time to have a little kiss! Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official. I believe in that. I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important. ...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you. Consider it nailed. Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know- I just need you to know- Oh. God. Nice to meet you. [Erin gasps at another girl outside her window] Well, Jess went out for a run but she'll be back soon. Hey ladies, Andy's here! [pops balloon] Suck it! [cheers, applause] It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis? These are delicious. Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, "Have you heard my originals? They're terrible." They said, "Even better." I said, "I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie." Oh! [laughter, murmuring] Right? Rough scene. Oh... at least we can kiss now. You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time. Yeah. Oh yeah. You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth? Don't come back. [someone throws food at the car] [singing] My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-Andy & ...my girlfriend's back! Welcome home. I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago. Two... [Andy runs out of the room] one. There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date. Oh, yeah, I was just tired. Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night. I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change. Yes? How? Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never. Okay? Washington Monument. Eiffel Tower. Dwight told me about it earlier. What? Wow, what are we talking about? Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional. Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses! Why don't you take a seat, you idiot? [throws chair] He does not like that wall. I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive. Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it. I... Got... It. There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot. Hey! It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week. No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that b*tch home! That is a female dog reference. [Points at himself] This b*tch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference [grabs dog] thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends! I am so great! Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times! Morning. Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot... these. You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone. What's this? Is this Robert's attempt to embarrass me? Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute? [Erin opens door] Erin. Who is it? Heh. Oh come on, Andy! A delicious moment. Well, but it- No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk... No. That is not the deal. Calibrate. Stop saying my name. Thank you, Erin. But have you ever actually seen him yourself?  Enjoy the snow losers. Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don't think anything's gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there's just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time. No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith's face. And if that makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim. A wheel is supposed to spin. This sucks. [to camera] Just... so weird. Really? I got something? Well, you know, I'm also Customer Service. [sarcastically] Yay, another person yelling at me. [referring to the letter] It's open. [talking on phone] Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on. [covers phone's receiver] Erin, do you know anybody that might want... [has realization] Oh my gosh. You love the news, right? He's looking for on-air talent and he'd k*ll me if I didn't get you on tape. You'll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we'll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. It'd be really tasteful and it'd really help me out with Duncan... with my friend. [Erin considers] What do you say? Huh? [Pete looks on disappointed] Ok. No, Clark's not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don't know them. [in his office] Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment? Has she done the pageant circuit? She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen. No. It's gonna be over before you know it. Um, where did you get that story? I love it. It's fantastic. Now, tag it with your name. Pause after 'news'. Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy. Wha, it's- Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how Erin relates to the other people on the news team. The weird thing is Erin is doing the audition alone. Now, I'd say Clark could be your co-host... he's already doing camera. Sorry, man. Andy though Erin needed a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied. [also as anchor] Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody. No, we got it. We got it. All right. OK. [to Erin] I'll call you later. [to Clark] So this is a single. Oh my—! Oh d—! Oh, how did—? [gasps] Huhhhhh! Oh, ok. Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let's knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. [pauses] Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament. Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat. I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French. [exclaims] Atherozar! My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama. I throat-rip. You throat-rip. He/she/it throat rips. More of a, barbaric growl. Louder! You're shouting it from the back of a horse! [snaps his fingers] Right on, brotha. Wurddd. Daraas! Hey Erin! [to Erin]. Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here? So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today. Not my slaves, my ancestors'. Maybe. Probably not. That you're learning a made-up language from HBO's Game of Thrones? I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out! Fonas chek! I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith. Oh my god! Lose weight. I'm trying. Sorry. Oh of course, you were adopted. Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..? Oh thank you so much! Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving. You got it. He's fine. He's indestructible. [laughs] Well, I have considered kidnapping one. Never say that. This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween. At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right? Hey. I'm an oncologist and you are a dog. It's Okay. Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys. [to Pam, under his breath] Can I have your sunglasses? Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I'm eating Jims. [laughing] Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink. Oh no, I'm spilling Jim all over the carpet. [laughing] They didn't know about the snowman story, and when I told ‘em, they were not impressed. Right? We don't know it. Look, I know it was big with the old guys, but-- Wha...? The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it's kind of pathetic. But when you're with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love. That's real. 'That'll never change! This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell? I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time? Duh. I know. That would be insane. It could totally work though. I don't know why we wouldn't. Oh my god are we doing this? If I am not Boner Champ, I don't know who I am. Make a donation. Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom. [on phone] Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. [pause] What?[HTC singing Cornell Alma Mater] [to Angela] I don't know what you're talking about. [Thumbs up Oscar] Guys, you don't understand, this boat's been in our family since before I was born. I worked at a Jiffy Lube. Fax? Cool. He's like 40 though, right? Iris, thank you so much for having me. Uh, did you need something? [Drives away waving, then screeches to a stop and runs from car] Look, it's not that I don't want- All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said "You can't be a skipper until you're a man." You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance. Tonight. Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now. Yeah, ok. Seriously? Alright. Let's do it. My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace! That's the family boat! Right? Ok. Geez, a little bit. [to boat] How you doing old buddy? Missed you. It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing. Really? Good stuff. Nice stuff. [begins raising sail again when guy leaves, but he comes back and smacks Andy's hand again] [bleep] Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah. I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it. Fine. But I could have. I am the captain. Right? I'm taking it over from here. Oh, Mr. Shrute, there's really no need to, um involve Mr... Wallace. I didn't. I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat. But I've decided to sail it to Bermuda. Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you. Do you realize that? You're the best ever! [pulling away from dock] Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy! [waving from boat] I'll see you in three weeks! Hey. She's back. Yeah, no problem. How was it? Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper. Oh. Nope. It's not that, he uh, uh he flipped a table one time when he was drunk. Yeah, he is. Ok. No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes. They're like two flaming meatballs in my skull. What else can I show you? Oh, damn it! [on computer] I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains. No. No! Nooo! [computer falls into ocean] I'm gonna need to put you on hold for a second. [presses hold button] Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where's Stanley? Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it? Yeah! Okay. [presses button again] Hey David, I'm back. Hello. No, she is the boss. Okay, this isn't working for me, ‘cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss. Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I've commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking color schemes and the major themes we want to h*t. Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper. But not in a child labor-y way. I am a person. Erin, did this call... What? Oh, I'm sorry. It's for the thing. Wow. Uh-huh. Yeah. Sweet. Nice.  Pretty soon, we're gonna be at the ceiling. Can you hand me a card? No! No, Oscar. He's a friend. He's a friend. Okay.[phone rings] You did it. Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning "Love," and adelph, meaning "Adolf." "the city that loves Adolf." Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.[Pam looks at Jim and nods her head in agreement] Is It? I'm just hoping German t*rrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses. Die hard reference. You haven't seen die hard? Why haven't you seen die hard? Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it. "Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs." No, it's not. My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it. Hear what? "You don't like flying, do you?" No, that's the-- "Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that--" That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes. I don't know. This looks pretty legit. [Erin's cell phone chimes] Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they h*t land. Hey. Everything okay? Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, [Pete stands up] "After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--" Or we can just sit and talk, though. I mean, are you sure...Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car. Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy? I'm gonna tell Jim to go [Bleep] himself. Yeah. Definitely. [Erin starts to cry] Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. [Starts to put his arm around Erin] Hey, hey. Come on, huh? Oh, yeah, of course. I know. Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home! What? Hurry up already. [checking Meredith's head] Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times. Make way, nope, inspect me. Dwight! Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen. Ew! Oh. [checking Stanley's head] Ooh yabber, lice! No! How? I'm so clean! That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day. Get off me! Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's k*ll or be k*lled! To be b*rned! I'm not gonna lie. Lye! She's right, it works. I would imagine. Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the b*lls to show them lice who's boss. I love it. [swings the scissors around and puts them into his pocket, putting a hole in his Hazmat suit] Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No! Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay? [putting mayo on Erin's head] How's that? Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...[Dwight drops the grenade and it goes off inside Andy's office] Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. [Dwight collapses] [shoving large amounts of bubble wrap into the baler, as a warehouse worker passes] No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay. Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go. Okay. Ha ha. That'd be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get... What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn't I think of this? Andy's not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I'm expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that? A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything's in order. Then looks like we have a deal... Son [holds up a suit identical to his] Hey, look who it is! Try this one. [handing Erin a cup of espresso] Thank you! [leaves the room] Let's do it! [to Erin] Stocking pens, huh? You're like the new office administrator. Pam! Pam, look out! Erin's g*n for your job! Pam, look out! [shocked after seeing the torn up carpet] Hey... What happened here? So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative? Wow. Oh. Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them "Like" Derek's "Likes." You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together. All right. Oh, check it out. This is our first real "Like." Oh! All right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific. Well done, you two. [doing a series of hand bumps with Erin] Bap, bup, bup, bap. Wait. Did I go first and then you? Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy. Well, Andy's cute, but he's too vanilla, whereas Pete - he's just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird. People, it's 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man? [groan] Hey. I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force. Well, okay, then. yeah. It's fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you. [phone rings] Yeah, mostly. Have you seen Darryl? Mmm. [exits, Erin smiles deviously] Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. [checks for anyone around] Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies. Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun. How much did you pay for that? Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it. Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house. [to everyone in conference room] I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it. Yeah, but this is different. I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So... And, poof! He disappears. [Jim snaps, playing along] Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind? We can do anything you want. Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'. And on his last day, we did everything he loved. [slightly surprised] Sure. I'll get my coat. I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived. Hey! Sweetheart! [approaches Erin] I have missed you so much. [attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment. Me too. So much. I'm so happy. I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe. Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover? Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her? All right. Everyone! [waves to office and exits] Yeah, I guess. Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish? What? OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here. On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time. I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun. I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years. I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again. OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly. Hey, you OK? Oh. Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK? [Erin smiles and kisses Pete] Good morning. Ok. [Andy continues moaning] I'm still the boss! The answer is yes. Are they from you? Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it. Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing. I don't want to talk about work right now. Then I want my big blue sweater back. Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now. Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now. Yeah. Hi. I'm here from BCI Marketing Consultants to meet with Andrew Bernard. Fresh meat! Fresh meat! [Making kissing noises] Nice to meet you. Cute sweater. It's uh, been a while, huh? Yeah. We uh, have a history. History. Wow, ok. We dated for two years. Well. Is it? You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin. Yeah. He told me you two broke up. Good night, D. I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship- Yeah you're also supposed to go to classes, so there's that. [laughs] Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out. I got a tattoo for you. How's that P.E. degree coming? That's what he wanted to be. His dream in college was to be a gym teacher. Erin, are you even hearing this? Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night. Give me one night with you... I have shaved everything... Shove his sashimi! [notices something new about Dwight] New glasses. In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil. I didn't really see a better parking spot. [drives into the dug grave] Whoa! Look what I did. It's a rental. [Dwight approaches and hugs him] You wanna go in? [both attempt to put the other in the dug grave] Good morning, Erin. Did I tell you about her teeth? Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV! We need to know more. Did their sh*ts have sound? What exactly did they get on tape? [humming] What the hell? No. This is NOT happening. Didn't you get the memo? It's Stairmageddon! [claps and opens the door to the stairwell] Come on Stanley! [claps] Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both ment*lly and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It's a... "Mageddon!" [growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they're making me climb Stair Mountain! This is an abomination. Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation's Lisa Loeb. Oh! Which public figure? That's kind of an impossible question. Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin' movie star! [kicks trash can] Oscar is the one who opened my eyes to who I really am. For the first time—  Quater finals in an hour. Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight. Did you? [pushes pencil cup at Erin] I'm pumped! I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense. Oh, wide wings, interesting. Hey. Why don't you back off?[looks at Pete]...I mean best of luck to you in the competition. Angela advances. Whoa! We've still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil. Erin! Erin! Just stop. Watch and learn. Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars. [throws plane far] Yeah! Ok! b*at that! [Erin throws plane, loses, Dwight laughs] Whoo! Ok. Yeah. [Erin kicks box] Whoa! Ok [tries to help her] Hey hey hey, whoa. Hey, Erin. Is Andy in? Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said "is Indian" and was like, "Is Indian what?" Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way. Lately, I've been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy's calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic. Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That's something you can't take back. Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor? See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward. Wow. Cause, uh [gestures to him and Erin and then to Pam and Jim with sound effects] Yeah, we should do that for real sometime. That's true, yeah.  increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they're protecting America's real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day's security codes. Something that's been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It's not the KGB, but it's a start. But the coffee in Peru is far hotter. This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter? The coffee in Paraguay is colder? Ah, much, ok. Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager. Uncanny. [everyone applauds] Oh, hey. Hey, what's up, y'all? That's totally uncool. I don't think I sh- He ain't coming. Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get. So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we're gonna be best friends. He's a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you. You chose one thing? You want to dance? This is what you want? Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we're gonna do this right. Thank you. Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor's up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. [Dwight kisses Creed's head] Oh! College baseball is on. What's it about? Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef's special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won't work. That's no good. Oh, boy. [screams] Stanley! I have a question for Erin. Yes. Um, the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother. So my question is, um, do... don't you hate her? I mean, I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her. Erin... Um...Oh, Erin.. Where'd you learn to dance like that? [still playing and singing] And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before. Okay, what are you doing?
