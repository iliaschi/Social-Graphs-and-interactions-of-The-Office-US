[song ends] Toby, how did we do? Yes. Of course. Okay. Wait, what? I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door] Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell. I know what you want to ask me. "Did your mom ever see you naked?" You don't want to know. Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now? One hour. One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today. No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time. You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me? Tell me! Toby, can I really tell you anything? And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? [howls and growls like a werewolf] Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? [pause] Three hours. We're half way done. Yes. Absolutely. Right away. Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today. This is plenty complicated. I've played it once or twice with Jeff. Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married. Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though. Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager. Yes. Don't forget the pipe. I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid. I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better. Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly. When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so... Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a g*n. Son of a b*tch. Wow! Ok. You. b*tch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game? You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry? Ok. So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation? That is not how it seems to me. You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior. You forged them! You forged the forms! Yes. Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake. Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the r*cist brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing. It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that. Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right? Kelly! Great costume! [handing out cards] For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prost*tute are from Cabo Corrientes. Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals... Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement. Hi. Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you? Death to Toby! What's the case, Toby? Is it criminal? Have we heard of it? Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex sl*ve? Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail? Oh, Scranton Strangler! [all react] That was the worst joke ever. Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye. What? What? Hold on, Holly's coming back here? Oh... What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse. That scowl. And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions. Okay. Hey, Toby. No way. That's increadible. You know what's crazy? What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting. So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out? And impressions! Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! [Toby comes up and take the mic] [hangs up and composes himself] Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. [looks at the list of members of the office, with some names crossed out] And I have said goodbye to half of them. [grimaces and nods, Toby nods back at him] Okay. Okay... [walks out embarrassed] I can bring him a welcome basket. I'll surprise him. Does he like jams? My shelves are over flowing with preserves. Change two, Toby, you're gettin' a new chair. Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting- Okay, sorry. I have no way of knowing if that's true. Okay, really? Come on. Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office? Nice try. Did you just trademark that... The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize. You don't work in sales, do you. You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don't be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don't ever think there is. There is only... sex. Everything... is sex. You understand that what I'm telling you is a universal truth,... Toby. Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke! I thought that was your job. You guys pay for relocation, though, right? I'm having a bad time. [chuckles] Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone. First, I'll take down the cubicle walls. I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby? Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about- The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling. I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport. Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. Alright. [hangs up] I'm the valet. You have to give me your car. I'm the... I'm the valet. You have to give me your car. Give me your car. Give me your car. Get out. Have a good time at the thing. Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault. And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do. 1, 2, 3!Gabe/Kelly/ Fine. Yes. Dying alone, that is very scary. And how are you, Toby? Toby? You're fired. You heard me. Pack your things. Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship. Yes. For Gabe. Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse. I'm not technically seeing her, but uh I've seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So..[holds up fist] Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know? Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays... Toby I'm going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she's going to be screaming it tonight. Hey! Watch it. Well he's probably a drug dealer. That's the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow. Pam you look more beautiful now than ever. Really well thank you all. Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing? That's okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time. Who walks around with their passport? Have you had any? Ah! I've been att*cked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer! Hmm... You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A m*rder for framing. Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective. Andy, you've gotta be kidding me. Um, it ta-, um it depends. Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine. Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right? Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club. I would love that. To both these bears. To madness. [Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine! [demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually. Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too. Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas] Hola Toby! [mimes choking] Uh- Thank you. sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby. Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why... Toby is giving us self defense training. Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense? We are closed! Come on. Ow. What the hell, Toby? What if you're being att*cked by a ... smallish man who happens to not have a groin? Why don't we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man. So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself? Can I please leave? I have a r*pe flute. Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink! So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- "How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls." Yeah.  Thank you. Thank you. Whether it's a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity. Good point? What is a tub of electricity? Good. Let's go. Let's go Kelly. You think you're so pretty!  Well you're not gonna be so pretty come Prom time! Take that!  Not so pre-violent anymore! Damn it. No. No. I been selling here for five years. This is my spot. You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting. I know. But sometimes you still get a little something. You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport. I do. [to Toby] Huh. h*t the road, jack. [looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me. Thank you. No, no, no, no. It's not worth it. Hungrier. [in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex. I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens. Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony? This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child. How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation. What? You messed up saying your name? Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff? [pointing at Toby] There he is. That's Lloyd. Where do you get off crossing state lines? Now, we're actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe. That's true. That's true. There's no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands? Stay out of my state. It's in your best interest to stay out of my state. Just stay out of New York, Lloyd. Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh? Oh, get out, skeleton man! [his phone rings] Huh? Hold on. I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy. Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace. An Altima or better. [tossing out winter coats] I don't need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan. I'm so happy for you Kelly. Helpless. [Playing computer game with Toby] You're looking good. Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive. Yeah, I gotta go David. [hangs up phone] Why is Nellie still here? Mm, then I will make up a cause. Then forget I just told you that. But your mouth is ble— What? Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity? Pam's first celebrity crush. Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to- Johnny Depp. [everyone looks confused toward Toby] Totally. George Clooney. OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please. Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall? What? Hey Toby. Yes. Yeah. I... Yes. I thought I'd you know, be you. [looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake. So... Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that. Those figures I gave you? They're false. I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively. Yes, he's innocent. What are you talking about? I just did this now. Sure. That's gotta be tough. Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh? I have very fertile hair glands. God! We even go to lunch, pick up babes. [sound effect of throwing ball] Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted? My pastor said it can come from breast feeding. Well, he didn't fight me hard on it. What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet? Is it called red-vining? Where are gay mens' vaginas? What? When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person's penis? Things? People?[Jim chuckles nervously] I'm sorry, the--Uh, the Scranton who? [Gasps] Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.[Stanley gets up and leaves] [Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he's walking by her] See you next Christmas. Okay. Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there. Very impish.[Nellie and Toby back in the kitchen, Nellie looks bored and standing against the fridge. Toby walking around] Shh. [Puts her finger to Toby's lips] Shh. [Put her finger to his lips again] Shh. No...more...talking. Fun. Oh, thank you. I don't know, I sort of thought-- Oh, I don't know. Okay. Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one. I didn't really think about it like that. "What we have"? Yeah. [to Nellie] Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. [Nellie nods] Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn. Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that? The first 'sorry' sounded sincere. Toby? No. Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge. They already have a contract? [Reading] "Mutually agree to-" Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch. Well, I'm not signing away my rights. Ok, well we'll see about that. [crumples paper] This is not an office so much as it is a uh, rec room with a bunch of computers in it. Frankly, if I had my way, I'd toss the computers in the gar-bage. But unfortunately we use them for practically everything we do. So. That ain't gonna happen. He's a temp, don't worry about him. Alice! Alright, stay awake ok? Um. Oh no. No no no no. No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes. Thank you Angela. Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name. She's looking good. Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb. Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and f*re her? Of course. Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question. It's a little, uh, personal. I wanted to talk to you about your divorce. Sorry. I—no, no, no, what I meant—what I meant actually was— You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it. Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple's counseling. No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we're just starting couple's counseling. Uh, which doesn't sound any better. My mistake. So how does it work? It's like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or... Mm-hmm. If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I—this will be so huge for our family. What do you mean? That was exhausting. Well, they deserve each other, then. That is for sure. Oh. Hey, champions. We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill [cut to Kevin flying paper airplane], others relied on showmanship [cut to Dwight throwing airplane at Nate with an apple on his head] others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. [cut to Creed throwing a melon] And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster. Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep. [Pam's plane h*t Toby in the eye] I didn't see you! You should have yelled "Crossing!" Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols. It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt. And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two. Go away, we're running lines. Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. [moves to lift Toby's eye patch] Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go. Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all. Yeah, but here's the thing. I can't have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I'll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners. Seriously? Come on, just do it. All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. [starts touching Toby's thighs] God, Toby, don't—stop blocking my hand. This is your—you brought this on. Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone's ever been fired, Toby's blocked it, so... Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I'm looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can't wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone. Oh. No. How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me? No. And I thought I unfriended you. Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab? Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody's actually filming you anymore? I don't know. I've just always been really good at dancing. Is it me? Is it Nellie? Good night. Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby? Come on. Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone's ever been fired, Toby's blocked it, so... Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I'm looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can't wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone. Oh. No. How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me? No. And I thought I unfriended you. Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab? Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody's actually filming you anymore? I don't know. I've just always been really good at dancing. Is it me? Is it Nellie? Good night. Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby? Come on.
