Coffee Monkey's arrived. He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. [starts drinking coffee] Ah! It's not cappuccino. Luke is my nephew. No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't? I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you. No, man. There was no list. Uh, but I got bagel chips. Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project. Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony. Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half. A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that? Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right? I get paid $40,000 per year. Maybe $50,000. No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500. Really? It was like amateur hour. I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs. No, that's... What? Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know? It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok. Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye. Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall? You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease. I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you. Look at that. Nice! Can't b*at a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself. Oh, look at that. [pushing bike] Smooth roll. You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike! Nice. Oh, god! What? [everyone finishes listening to song] Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar? You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and- Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay? So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can. Stop it! It's gonna be great. And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it. Hola. Que tal? No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me. Night, everybody. Thanks! Public School, at exit 11. Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination. How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days? Oh. [walking down the runway] Raaah! [waves sword] Wait, wait. She hasn't moved in awhile. You could feed the hungry. Us. Really? [cheers, applause] Thank you. All right. Okay... Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it! You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from... [changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.] Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores. We're behind. I wasn't recording it. Wait, why do you have to record it? Oh, God. Hold on to your wallets, ladies. Fun, communication, connection. Well, it's tight, as with any start-up. I'm sorry, nine days until what? Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend? [gasps] No, no. That is right now. In terms of land, not population. No, no you're wrong about this. I'm on it Jim. I'm on it. Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael. Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order. I have a computer question. Hey Oscar? Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael? Try 'Control P'. Oscar it must be k*lling you to know that Michael is smarter than you. I said see you later building. Hey. Mmm. Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Did you know, that China has a new m*ssile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast? China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us. How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%? Reply it! Yeah, I figured that. Wait. You forgetting something? Here we are. I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to b*at China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation. Raise your cups on high. Case closed. Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that. Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes? I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator. I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena. Oh, that would be impressive... ifanyoneknew what a comptroller was. Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so... Hi. Oscar. A pleasure. Merry Christmas. And Merry Christmas. Wow, that's awesome! You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans] An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters. Make time for romance! My boyfriend. No! You can't have any candy! K-a. "Ka"? What does "ka" mean? Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing "moo", I'm playing "milk". Whatever it takes. Uh... Like the cow mood yesterday. God. The cow jumped over the moon. That brilliant little b*tch. Wait. Why? I think there's better... You could have just told us what you were thinking. There's no yelling in that, either. Maybe. Only maybe. Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself. Yes. Apoplexy. No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married. Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good. But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line. What's it say? Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island. Yeah? Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for. Seriously? Go get 'em. Start quipin'. Umm... "You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here." Ha. Tasteless? Yes, well done! Oh. [rubbing hands with Holly] Are these numbers correct? Okay. Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out. I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA. Uh-huh. No one is more thrilled for them than I am... Obviously, so happy for them both. No, stop! Just don't. Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem. So we kiss occasionally. Okay. Fine. No more PDA. Anything goes. I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it. Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! [claps] Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend! I do. Suck it, Oscar. This must k*ll you. Congratulations. I am sorry that I have to do this... [starts choking Oscar to death with his towel] [muttering] Sometimes you over react. Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh? Michael, she's perfect for you. I had a great idea until you ruined it. Dallas indeed. Yeah. I saved 3 years salary. No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect. That guy's got more than he can handle as it is. Did that? Did that just happen?! [runs after Michael] We should.. we should write a movie or something! I'm serious! It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice. You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something. I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go! [throws sandwitch into Kevin's open mouth] No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. [disgusted comments by co-workers] No body go in there. Stay where you are. Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning! [laughing] I'm here. [DeAngelo gasps and turns around] In a good way! I've been here the whole time. I watch you when you sleep. No it's not. You gotta play along man. [quietly groans] Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. [takes a sack tied in the upper middle making a crude head, with a face drawn on, obviously the product of poor craftsmanship, Oscar pretends to like it] How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator. Mmhmm, bravo! [Andy walks by with DeAngelo, says quietly after he leaves] Walk away b*tch. My last pay check? No. Don't thank me! Hey, don't thank me, guy! Okay? And I don't care if you like it. Oscar? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation...All but Aah! Aah! It's so loud! [scatting off-key] Something's definitely wrong. Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD. Seven, two... Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief] Okay. [looks ashamed] The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid. And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids. Did you see him at a bathhouse? The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins. Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there. You're in the gay mafia. No. Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. [smiles] You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while. No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat. Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise. Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot. She does seem happy. [hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh! I've been turned into a puppet! Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?... So now anyone gets to talk at any times? What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed] Yes. What a surprise! Minorities sticking together. Oh, for God's sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb] Yeah, she does like Elmo. Bye. Yeah, alright Kev why don't you come with us? No, he's fine. I mean, he's gotten worse over the years.... I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties...and tie clips. Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN? [interrupting] I'm afraid you've lost my interest. This is what's under the blanket. Ooooh! ....back orders and you never called them. There's a dog in the car. Do Snowboarders hate animals? Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time. Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Alright! Nice job, Oscar! So...ah, who's gonna take the dog? What if he jumps out the window and runs away? Whoa! Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog? When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ... playing my birthday. We're lookin' at at least one su1c1de and one weird sex thing. I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement] Are you volunteering? Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy. Definition. Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong? Oh, he's plenty strong. It's simpler this way. I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up. How's it going over here, guys? Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table. Well, technically FOR Andy. I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too. Rosebud? I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed. Um, cheeseburger. Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour. Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello. I'm only scared of real things like serial K*llers and kidnappers. Not things that don't exist like ghosts or mummies. Pam do you think anyone's going to notice I've worn this costume before? When I wasn't pregnant. You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits. The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement. The most well known film in the genre is an hour long sh*t of a squirrel with diarrhea. What's the story? How did you get in my car? This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Oscar, use a calculator. [Oscar shakes head] You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right? Six-seventy, six-twenty. yes! What does this mean? What does it mean! No! In the box. [hits it straight into the floor] Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'- I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy] Haho! It's going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office. It's going to be good to have someone hot at Pam's desk huh? I'm kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She's obviously super cute I get it. But I'd like to point out there's 50 pounds more of me to love if that's your thing. Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you're saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman. Yeah. Drive carefully! Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil w*r. Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written. The truth. Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed. Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this- Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil w*r? No! No, it was not! No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern? Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle! Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut? Yes. I am an accountant. Really? Schrute Farms did you say? That is a fascinating little chapter of the Civil w*r. [on film] You have to understand. Poets, artists, dancers – these kind of men preferred peace to w*r. These delicate lovely men found a place of refuge among the Schrutes at Schrute Farms. Amidst the macho brutality of w*r this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight. I like to think of Schrute Farms as the Underground Railroad for the sensitive... and well... fabulous. I've seen enough. Oh yeah? Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion. We have a gym at home. It's called the bedroom. [sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away. Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?Andy/ I am not asking, I am ordering. No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing. [grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle? That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle? Is that ladle stainless or... Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup. [Jim chuckles] Aw, let me see- How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you? Yes! Yeah! [laughs] I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though. Dwight. Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it's a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like... What? Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar, you're in charge of the bar. [yawns, "Idiot" is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin? Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper. Books! Excellent, Jim. Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to "play ball." Those were his words. So make that error! Hey! I can make that error. It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say? Oh. What? It's a command. You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you. I've got a quota to h*t. I don't care how I h*t it. Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay? No. Nah. It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. [Oscar's friend walks up] Not anything. Aesop's? This 2001 masterpiece from Gilles Paquet-Brenner explores the intricate dynamics of a family in disarray. The Einsteins win it! [applause] [Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though. Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs] Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me? Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you're simply a penis, a vag*na, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a Pilates studio. Wine collection. [laughs] About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers. Good night. To the kitchen. Onward! Note? It's a symphony. Bears. And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like. Ah, no. Right month, wrong year. Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work. Everyone, our very own Angela- I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants. Yes? Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here? Phillip is so fat. [sighs] I don't even know what the truth is anymore. Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many dr*gs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring? Aw, preemie pajamas! I got Little Kevin Call of Duty. Shh. It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio. Really? Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago. The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata. Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock. And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious. Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe? Okay. [sits] Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now. So don't. What? How long before? Damn girl! Your body! Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back. I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons. Stop. Stop it Andy. Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it. So cute. That is where we disagree. Angela is such a liar! It's maddening! No one said "you must have two" Unbelievable! Stop it. One order. How you doing, Val? [Val and Brandon kiss] Oh no, I'm not actually Jamaican. Thank goodness he was there. Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don't want to leave yet. I haven't had so much fun since seeing... zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun. What if you're being att*cked by a 4'11" man who is penisless? What? Poor Andy! First you got b*at up by a g*ng, and now she kicks your ass? I don't... I don't... If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure? You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the "treasure box" and slams it down on Dwight's desk] I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees] I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone. Did a good job, Buddy. Now it's time to come home. Yeah he does. None taken. Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans] I know, right? It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party. Pam, we have a great idea. I knew she'd cr*ck! I wanted to leave you out, you know. What are you talking about? Yes we can. Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult. This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent. Why thank you. Oh, the plants are gonna love this. Tell me about it. It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male. What are you doing? Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is. Oh, no, no, no. This poem would crush you! Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing? Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people... You know, Oscar, I really had no idea you were so passionate about animals. really? Well, if you want to get involved, call me. This is my cell. I'm more likely to pick up night, say after 9... Excuse me. [Walks away.] [waiter is cracking pepper into Andys salad] Oh, yes indeed... When! [Waiter begins walking away.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] When! Oh my god! Wait, what? Come on! Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter? I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes! Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.] Or you proved that he thinks you're gay. Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar. sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here. Oscar! It was lovely! And don't forget to call. Robert?  Oh. ...with you. [chuckles] Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam. I'm throwing out all my mirrors. No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist- Put some ice on it. Oh, Andy. I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back. Hey. You didn't call. Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I'm not that good at puzzles. Oscar, Oscar, will you take him? If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person. Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn't given me a definite yes or no. [bleeding heavily from the mouth] That's not true. Just give me another chance. No, the baby. Please, it's my husband's favorite cat. He's broken up about it. It's the only time I've seen him cry other than our wedding night. Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you! Please don't teach the cat French. That Clark, huh? Errr [punches palm] Ca! Who was Pam's first celebrity crush? Yeah. News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy. Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride. Whhooooo! [laughs] What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it. [chuckles] I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! [Mimicks smacking everyone with a whipl]. Why? Is it employee's day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays. No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it's not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it. Might've done. And how... do you figure? You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.[ringtone of Dixie plays] Okay, Kevin did that. I do not wish I was in Dixie.[answers phone] Hey mom, how are ya? Did any Bernards ever own a plantation in the south?[to the group] She said no! Take that![gets back on phone] Follow up question. Did any Bernards, ever, make money, in an unsavory way?[speaks quietly into the phone] I just asked you! Why didn't you just say that?[continues speaking quietly] Oh, stop! Stop! Stop talking! Stop taking! That's—no! I don't wanna know that. Ok. You're interrupting a meeting I have to go. Love you. Bye.[faces the group] Well, turns out the Bernard's of yore did not own slaves. Fail. I'd like to take a solemn moment to remember Jerry in the warehouse who passed away this year.[Screen flashes 'FAIL' over Jerry's face, accompanied by fart noise, repeats twice.]Well, that's all folks.[photo of Andy watersking shows on screen]Ski ya later everybody. Thanks for a great season. [Group claps halfheartedly] [Gasps] Oh my god! [on phone] There are a hundred packs.. Shh! Ninety nine cases..yeah. Wh... 314 pies. Dwight, what the hell? We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim] I insult you, Oscar. I insult you! To your face! Then why don't you do something about it? Role call. And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator? So Oscar, you're a dinosaur. God, it's just so good to see you.  [to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute? Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so, [bleep] him. That's beautiful. No, I totally get that. I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that. Sounds great. What does that mean? That doesn't surprise me. The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out. [Getting up to leave] I can't, it's too much! [laughing] [holding hand over phone] This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me. Yeah. Kevin. His gambling problem must've resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation. [on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion? Hi. Oscar, we're in the middle of talking. What are you doing? How? So you set him up. I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible. A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler.. I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict. Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information. I just had a little intuition that someone I loved needed a little bit of attention today. Oscar, you're looking very healthy. Getting lots of vigorous exercise? [touches Oscar's shoulder. Oscar jumps away quickly] What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't mean any offense. I was just trying to be friendly. It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A! U..s..a. U- Hi. Spring cleaning? [whispering] I think the senator is having an affair. I think the senator is having an affair. When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile. And he's always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it's Hot Yoga with Blake. I don't know. Right. Right? What? Which one is the instructor? There all fatties. Where? Oh my God! She's so stunningly tiny! She's like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they're doing. [gasps] I've heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I'd like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let's go. Ow. [whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let's go. Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can't get enough of the show? Your jollies are all on f*re -- What? Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay? Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing? [ducking under table with Oscar] Oh. Oh.  Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I'm having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she's cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it's business as usual. Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question? Is it cool in here to you? I think the thermostat is acting up again. Thank you. No, thank you, Angela. How much wine do you have? Oh, thanks, Oscar. You're such an angel. Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me. Come -- come with me. There's no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps. What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who's the father of her child? I'm sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, I'm gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- Stop! No! If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend. See ya later, Trevor. I just saved your life. You're welcome! You deserved every bit of it!  You made my husband gay. No. No. Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you. God! [kicks Oscar] You were supposed to be my friend. Don't blame me for something we all forgot. Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot. Please just take my name off of everything. This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces. No. Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia? You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year [looks over at Angela, then back to Oscar]...as impish! [Smacks Oscar with a stick][Angela smiles smugly] Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault. [checking Oscar's head] Oh yeah, big time lice. Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos. Oh. Okay. Oh, thank you. Oscar, do you want to be my partner? Oh God. Stuck with the weirdo. Wow. He got to purple. Sorry. Hey, did Erin already take off? Hey! Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that's Italian. Always with the friends Oscar. Can't we just enjoy the new espresso machine? Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose. Ahh... Taste test? I'm in! What? [everyone is confused] Yeah, we're aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it. Yes! Three... Four! It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here. Actually... You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I'll take one too. Frickin' A! So long, noise! And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we're going to be in so much trouble! [reluctantly] Everybody dance now... [Darryl continues singing] You shut up! Hey, it's five o'clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot] An "X." What? Well, I'm heading out to Cece's dance recital. This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want. Yeah right. With slammin' bods like that, they ain't playing checkers. Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper]. Okay.[sound of applause on phone] Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off. This is not natural. But it's Dwight who's bring in all the weirdos. No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about. What? I'm his! His... wife. Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage. Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question. [at Phillip's party] Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck. He even looks like a mole. Yes. We're good friends. Good friends. You know, I suppose that may ruffle a few feathers. For a long time, our party has turned it's back on the Hispanic people. Well, that is not who I am. [puts arms around Oscar] I am a friend of the Latino community. And if you ask me, it's time we bid bigotry hasta luego. [guests laugh] Now, does my embrace of Hispanics make me more electable? Given demographic trends? I don't know. And I don't care. What I care about is Oscar. [slaps Oscar's cheek] My friend. Mi amigo. Oscar. [guests applaud as he hugs Oscar] LaShawn. Great. You wanna be in a photo? Right this way. [notices overweight man following] Not you. No. Let's just wheel Margaret right in front... Thanks so much for coming. Thanks so much. [to Oscar and Angela] Well. Have we all calmed down yet? It's what I do. [everyone begins to leave] No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that. Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship. No. No discount for two men. Two men are not a couple. I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something. For two hours? Really? Wow, that's wonderful! I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen. Andy! My grandfather know. Mah Jong will be here to stay. Hobbies of the East continues in a moment. You could all be doing this, just saying. Why can't you just do regular sit-ups? Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now? Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis] [after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right. Excuse me? OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face] [at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here? [smirking] Oh, yeah. Jeb, my brother. You were the aunt to my cousins. Most of your life you were 5'4", at the end you were 5'1". Hey. Dwight's sister. Yeah. We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness. No! [Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song? Oh, I don't care. What was that word they said when they showed me "Skrald mand"? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up] What about me? "Klokken tre pige" What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they've just had sex] Oh! I didn't know they were filming then! There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am. No! Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping? Oscar. I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out. Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something] [Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator? Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! [Slaps Oscar] God! Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career. Call him! Call him! [hits Oscar] Call him! Call him! [On speakerphone] You've reached Senator Robert Lipton, please leave a message. [beep]Angela & Hi honey! No you go. Hi honey! It's Angela and Oscar. Just a few quick things. Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential. Yeah. Yeah! Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it. I think we're good. Bye! Come on! [claps] Come on. You got this. Here. Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in. [drinks a 5-Hour Energy sh*t and groans] Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn't know, you didn't know, and you didn't freaking know. But I knew! [claps] Yes, we did it! --with this new self-awareness, I was finally able to find love at long last. With my amazing... Chief of Staff Wesley Silver. Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator. Little raw. Not cool Oscar. Huh. Well, you know, you can't have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what's most important. That's my new thing. Two sacks' worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house. And they're gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone. Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I'm taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever. What? So, all the numbers adding up? He was good. Night, Oscar. Well, I've changed my mind. Oh, god, could you just mind your own business? Oh, god. You don't want me at your place. Well... Thank you. Okay. Are you allowed to have pets? So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross? I wouldn't know. I never lived with a gay guy. [starts sobbing] I love him. Mama! Ok, coming. Hi, baby. Angela's divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it's Angela who's living in the closet. Hey-o. Daycare won't take Phillip anymore. Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won't forgive. So, hi. Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard's. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions. Why didn't you pack the apple snacks? Guys.Angela & Not now, Kevin. Can't you see we're busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks. Maybe forever. Anyhow— What? I'm moving the ink down in my pen, for work. Don't tell me what to do!Angela & Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true. All right. He does have a gift. Run, old man! Run! Run! Run for your life! Get off. Don't you dare. Don't get—I could see it. You were gonna get handsy with me. Not interested. I'm Casey Dean! You'll be seeing the last of me. Er, I meant you won't be seeing the last of me! [addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you. Can't hear you. I'm giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored? Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes. Phillip got this for me? Whoa. No, Kevin, no. Whoa! I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I'm gonna miss these guys. See you guys at Poor Richard's, all right? Okay, bye. Bye, Phillip. High five. Are you sure you don't want me to drop him off? All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye! No one is ready for this. You can't be ready for this. We don't even know what this is. Based...on his merit. After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. [pause] Not really my scene. Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It's..it's all over the place. I don't know what it means. Andy? Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo's here. Let's do this. Change if you need to. Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy. Woah-Oh! Haven't been in one of these in forever. They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a cliché. I'm a man. So I'm going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out. Private Room. Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success. That's how I got my new job in the admissions office. You're telling me! Oh, great. He's getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung. I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I'd love to contribute to your campaign. I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I'm exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I'm still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they're the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that. Oscar. Oscar. [crying] I think I'm gay. [sniffles] It's just that I'm so emotional. No, but maybe the reason... Based...on his merit. After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid.
