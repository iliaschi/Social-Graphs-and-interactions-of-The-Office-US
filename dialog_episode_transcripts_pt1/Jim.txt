Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy. It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay? The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man. Where? Give me that. Yes. Go get 'em. Sorry. It was really funny. Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a m*rder? Really safe. Thank you. Get whatever you want, on me. All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store. He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean. Yes, of course. What is this in reference to? Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight. I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video. Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing. They do call me that. Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor. Yeah. How ya doin'? Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building? Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers. Were you painting in the dark? I don't really think we need... Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim. Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed. We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success. No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible. What? Oh no, no, no. America is one big mall. [on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes. I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok. Tell me I'm good at sales. Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're "appearance"ists! Yeah, what happened Dwight? Yeah! I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out. Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...? That's great. Is he still doing his boycott? You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo. [fanfare] Go get 'em Dwight. 00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards. It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal. Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge. You work on commission, don't you? No, we don't. Of course, but he looks much less threatening now. Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir! You made a big mistake. Huge! Aaah! Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd'] Hey, how are those salads? Yes! Yeah. You all made it, thank you so much. Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine! We can relax. Sounds like Cece. [sees Erin holding Cece] Oh, my God! Go, go! I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home. Why are you here? I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything. Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want. Okay. Thank you. This night was a disaster. Yeah? Get it. Let's get our juice on. Yeah! My last physical when I was forty. What, is it because he's black? Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia. [Kevin is grossed out immediately. The office is grossed out] Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise. Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike. Come on, Michael! Yeah! Not the car! How do I look? Normal. Ugly. We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash. Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending. And who is this "the" Steve Nash? No. No, Mr. Jock Hipster. Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists. Danny Cordray is the worst. The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone. Also, he slept with Pam. No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing "yes, he did"] Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again. That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle. No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right? I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay? Watch this. Hey, Dwight. Good to see you. Jim, hey. Like hell you are. Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea-[cell phone rings] Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello? It's Jim, Okay? Yes. You need the big g*n, yes? What'd he say? What did he say? Oh, no, that's a male model. Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two-- Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then. Jim talked too much. What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy. You know what this is? This is a stinger. Like the movie. Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers. Thanks, hun. Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you. Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire k*ller. Shhh! Hey! That's my mug. Testify. So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too. We gotta get someone else in there right now. That sounds fake. I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father- Okay. Then make him pitch to you. We gotta see what he's got. Okay, and remember-you're not gay. Okay. Uh, Manuel, cleano el window. Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in- No, no, no.... No! We're not- Gotcha. [they go into Michael's office] Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates. Yeah. Way ,way, way back. Oh. She was not into me. You snubbed her. Thank you. What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now. I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours. People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings! [has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me. I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on. [places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye! Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam. We were basically Romeo and Juliet. Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates. But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor. And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please? Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party? [removes teeth] Creed's going?! Can you imagine? It's just crazy. Exactly. No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so... Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back? Hey. This is some party, huh? Are you serious? You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and... Halpert, you lookin' for someone to bang your wife? I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it. Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago? Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky. No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company. Oh, wow! That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what- NO, no, no. They will cost you your life. Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger. Yes. I would welcome it. Cece's getting christened today. Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that. But I'm the Godfather. Are you talking to me? [looking at Cece's diaper] Somebody needs a change. Well, she can't bring this up with her. Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip. [seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What? Honey, no. No, no. We have an extra outfit in the bag. You said you checked it. Before we go, I'd like to remind everyone that the "Halberts" have been kind enough to host a reception next door immediately following the service. Mm. No. Wrong on both counts. I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people. I'm Doug Mcpherson, Davey's uncle. Davey. [to Cece] Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you. I don't know. I'm just hungry. [holding up an empty serving dish] What was this? You're out of it. Who the heck was that? We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas. No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month. [standing in the church sanctuary, talking to the stained glass] Why you always got to be so mean to me? I don't know. I lost the purse too. No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus. Jim, Jim, I want to give a toast. Where's the little girl of honor? I don't mean to bug, but do you know when those subs are due into port? I got a hungry bunch of Mcphersons over there. I think maybe some blonde lady had her. Smaller than me. [holding the baby, walks up to Jim] Hi, honey. I was just changing the baby. [walks up] Honey. Did you think I stole your baby? Did you lose Cece? It's pronounced wacko. [obviously faking being serious the whole time] Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat! [walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life. Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe. [pours powdered seahorse into his wine glass] Jim what are you doing? Flip it back please. [grimacing] That's what she said. [leaves] It's a miracle. She loves him. I do. But you married my worst enemy. From Jim. Do it! [referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth. I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading. I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced. Yeah sure, Jim could go see her. You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues. [to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please. [as the power and lights come back on] My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet. Uh... try "password". Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero. Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one. Um, everyone was getting their driver's license. You're typing "Big Boobs"? Try "Big Boobs" with a "Z". So, uh... [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales. [on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background] Commission comes out to... dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero. You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero. Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love? When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean? Nudity makes me uncomfortable. No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles. Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now? Did you prank Dwight? Well, you like that. I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own. [singing] But it just may be a lunatic... [stops singing] No. Hey, kid--hear you're looking for work. Can you at leasttryto look busy? [Jim Exhales] Thank God. Now, I love reading, and I hate being interrupted. Shut up and listen, you gay bastard. Chapter One. I was born, not into luxary, nor poverty. [Gabe looks through Jo's book] But into adversity, and for that, I thank the Lord. My Father was a man. That's all we can know. After I learned to ride a bike, there was no stopping me. I would ride up Magnolia Stree and down Azalea Lane. Which would later become my-- [picks up pencil between his toes] [typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear. [lifts cup up with toes] [spills hot coffee on himself] Uhh, aah! Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner. "Which is you" is not a sentence. Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar? Suck it Oscar. So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours? Not really, because I found one. Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room. Good. Actually, it was. Sure. Coffee Jim. It is not just coffee. Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary. Pass. I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs. Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II. I don't need to cheat. I lied about some aspects of the building. There's no building... it doesn't exist. I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna... Fail. I don't want to fail... again. And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales. Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it? People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one. One, two, three. [everyone jumps] Still some people not jumping. It hardly looks fake. It's so lush. I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking. [mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful. Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here! You apologize to me right now. You apologize right now. Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter. Okay. Hey. Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year. I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good. I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking. Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! [dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off] [as Marge] Oh, Homey. [they both laugh] What kind of g*n do you have? Six-sh**t? [turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally] Oh, no. Oh, no! Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath! Huh? You like that? Huh? Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone. Oh, Jim. Hey. There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse... Who looks exactly like you. Yeah. No, it's uncanny. What? I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress. Why would anyone frame you for that? [laughs] I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids... Okay, hey, hey, hey... Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something? [Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe. Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it] [lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God. I love it. Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that. Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder. Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] "The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert." Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter. Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall. I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent. You h*t Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch. Hey, sorry. I'm ready. Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker] I'm sorry. I had no idea. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. What? Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey! Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels. One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us. What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader's voice] Dwight, don't be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim. Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim. Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them. Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag. It was pretty cool. It was pretty awesome. Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best. Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous. No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy, If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night. I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at. What's going on? Do you know that guy? Hey. I played "ape." You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close. [entering conference room] [as Mikanos] What is taking that guy so long? I don't know. They're still in there. Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom. And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group. And Tom... And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence. Right. But how'd you say it? Hey, you think it's cool if I grab a soda? Hey. How's it goin'? It's been a while. So you work here, huh? Must be a front for some kind of famous laboratory. [laughs] 'Cause you're so smart. Oh, barely. I'm so dumb, you know, stuff goes in, stuff goes out. Not like you probably remember every paper sale you ever made. Paper salesman genius. Yeah. And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand] Bye. I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you. Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny "Jim" game. All right, what'd you do? Where'd you put it? Let's go. Say it. Where? The fridge. The fridge, got it. Let's go! Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts. Just drive faster. I want to get back. Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit. No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim? I need to pee. Yeah, I do. My word against yours. What part of "I need to pee" do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car. Well I hope I make it. Hi Jim, it's Helen. Everything is fine. Baby's fine. She has a tiny fever. I'm taking her for a check up. Nothing to worry about. A tiny thing. I locked her in the car. She's smiling. She's happy. Jim, I don't have a spare key. This is Pam. What's wrong? Jim, what? Oh God! What?! Ok. She's ok? Understood. Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a "Ask Pam Beasley". ... Did the phone cut off? Alright, just call me after the doctor. I jus... I just need a signature. How much did you give him? Wait. I don't have my scarf. I'm missing my scarf. Oh. [both laugh] [loudly] Yeah, lunch was wonderful! Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there? Yes. Never found that bottom, did we? Andy. Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat] You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine. Oooh. They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife. Yeah! That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right? You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him. Sorry. No. No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here. That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die. Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office. Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed. I just told them to do it! No. That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth. We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie. [Jim, with his face painted with metallic gold paint] Oh someone's coming alright, the only man who would care. [Goldenface turns in his chair, holding a golden g*n] Michael Scarn. See I'm gonna lure him here, then I k*ll everybody, then... I'm gonna dig up Scarn's dead wife, and I'm gonna hump her real good. [malicious, deep laughter] [as a drunken man in the bar] If doing The Scarn is gay, then I'm the biggest q*eer on Earth! [turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains] We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states. Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why? No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken sl*ve! Jim will be made a w*rlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months. Could be. I can see that happening, yes. That's a realistic time line. Perhaps. I can see that as a very real possibility. I can see that happening. Whoa! Yes! Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff. Awwh, you're welcome. [they hug] My pleasure. I just helped someone out. It feels good. Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk. Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair! That's how he gets you to take off his panties. Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done? [to Jim] So you two are married to each other now, right? That's sweet. How's the sex? 'Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife. I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Viva A Fox. [winks] [interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second? None of your business. It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this. Really. I know. Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate. [mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff? Who is Justice Beaver? Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that? [to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper] eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point- Well thanks, will do. That sounds weird. [also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World. What are you doing? I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why? He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him. People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1. What is this? Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes? That's a common swindlers trick. So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs] Jim, put those away. just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans? She's the one. How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.' It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring. Where was that. At a gas station? Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever. I know but I'm still scared I don't know why. You were scared? Nice. Can't really tell the... I know right...[sees Jim's beans] what the? That... that's impossible. All right, I'll take them. Probably. [walks away with beans] This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives. Congratulations! Yep. But, no, but we are a family. Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss! Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable. Da-das. You know what, enough about your baby, ok? I'm sorry. Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot. No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No. You'll figure it out. That's a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable. Very cute. See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand. Congratulations! You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards! [holds up a camera and DeAngelo meows] Here we go! Have Pam come down. What's going on? Uhhh, you sir! [points to Jim] Are we having fun tonight? Oh good! No, no, no! This is the performance of your life! THE DUNDIES! Get away from the car, he's gonna see you. [desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in! Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time? What? Thank you Jim. [Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records? Fall asleep right after sex. Huh guys? There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! [Dwight plays a celebratory honking noise on his keyboard] Well done. You didn't think to mention me huh? Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please? So what you're saying is you kinda like it? [Phyllis impression] I've fallen and I can't get up! [normal again] That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good. That got a big laugh. In costumes! [Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies. [weak] Hi Tuna. I'm going to! Nah, I'm almost done. I know... go big, or go home. You go with This guy, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life, OR, the biggest, Good decision of your life. It's either gonna be the best thing you ever did, or the worst thing you ever did. If you want some boring, white bread clock-watcher who's gonna get you your paper when you ordered it, for the agreed upon price, [Andy looks hopeful] Andy's not your guy. [Andy deflates] You ever play Russian Roulette? [scoffs] Time to spin the chamber horse. By signing up for another year. [hands the client a folder he needs signed for another year's contract] [looks at the clock to see it is three o'clock] Jim where is Pam? [the office looks up expectantly] Ummm... Hm... No. [changing his mind] No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. [walks out and then back in, now using a Vietnamese accent] Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! [the office groans] And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! [only Kevin is laughing. Stanley tries to leave. Michael hugs him] I ruv you all! I ruv you very much! Sure. [Ping accent] Be right out! [sad] Ohh... [holding back tears] Okay... Maybe. Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing? [pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man... Oh, okay. [hears a taxi honking] Oh sh**t! That's my cab. Alright. I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright? I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am. [entering his office] Hey dudes! Oh my God, he hates me! I know. Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings? Oh, there's an inner circle. Oh yeah. [sh**t mini basketball at hoop on office door, misses badly] Is that ball lighter than usual? Is that a Chinatown knockoff? Yes. Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes [starts to run out of the break room] yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes! What's wrong with juggling, Darryl? I'm a big juggler. I actually perform a motivational juggling routine. [imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling b*lls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands. What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him? [to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it? Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office? And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye. Snip snip. Am I right, girls? So what's up? Yeah sure. Let's make it a meeting. [Darryl, Kevin, Gabe enter office] What's the big secret? Why are you even whispering? Come on, it's the guys! Hot! Damn! Are you serious? Who feels this way? Umm, Pam? Guys. Hold on. Doesn't matter who, okay? I'm just happy that Jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had - I had no idea. Absolutely. [heading into Deangelo's office] Jim, you coming? Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand. At least he likes one of us. Internally, for office use [Jim quietly enters Deangelo's office and sits down] where do we get our paper from? Do we go - [staring at Jim] Hey Jim. Can I help you? So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh? Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief. Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market. Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week. Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project. Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles -- You're back in. Yeah, we'll set that up one day. Yeah, I don't know. Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership. Seems a little close, you sure that's the real foul line? Nah, that's 15. Yeah. Okay, Jimmy, this is for you. Show you that anything is possible. Alright? This is also for the troops. [backs up, bounces ball, starts running, jumps, lands in front of Kevin, jumps again, pulls himself up by the net, dunks ball, hangs on rim] Doctor is in! [hoop starts to fall] Ahhhh! [hoop crashes down on Deangelo] [speaking gibberish] Tablab. Who should I say is calling? That's true. Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand] Nope. Baskets have it. So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high. [on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently] Can't stay there all day. Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy? You'd slow me down. [quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection. Define foment. [seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist? You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion? Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist. I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him. Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The g*n is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue. The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business. Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior. Don't make me f*re you. Don't make me pre-f*re you. Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired. What? Okay. Thank God. What's jazz hands? Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down. Yep. Who is it? Shut up. [running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed... We need a new manager. Absolutely--I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits. Yeah. How would we know that, if you don't... I guess I could be, if I was... who would do that? Tell you what. I'll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part. Color-code sent documents, TM. That's a verbal trademark. That's an agreement. Can you do any better on salary? What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain't cheap, you know. No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim] Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me. That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim? [more emphatically than Jim] Yes. You do. [nods at the Search Committee, then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face] Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk. Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job. [noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that? I... I just thought you knew me. Well, I'd want to move further away, you know? Just... I don't want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office. [pulls out a tupperware from his briefcase and takes out a tupperware] I'm leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really. [opens tupperware] You know, all of 'em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just... I had to get outta there. [begins eating sandwich] Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified. I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course. [happily] Uh, 93 million miles. Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way. [walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family? Good. They good? What's your daughter's name again? Peepee? Peepa, how is she? Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim? Now, listen,... Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel. I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam... Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment. Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back] Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this. Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim] So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim] Hope it's all right. The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do? Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about. Yes. How did he do? Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke. Everyone would be known for their accomplishments. By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle. Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor. Is there a front runner? Well, there must be someone who stands out. My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves] You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves] Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning? I have no idea. [mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager. [again] Assistant Regional Manager. [in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager. Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight. [whispers] Yeah. That's f***ing crazy. [Jo and Dwight both smile] Get outta here. [Dwight leaves] What a nutjob. Okay, it's fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who's got ya excited? It's not. Let's get Kelly in here to take his place. 'Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong. I'm doing an opposites thing. How'd my girl Nellie do? She didn't mention it? Integrity move. I like it. Hmm. Dwight Schrute. You have to interview me... I demand more questions! Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it. What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique g*n was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing. Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves] [sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed. I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel. Yeah, it was a great deal. Well, we could try him out for a little while... [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in... Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager? He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me. That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet. Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad. Tuna... You're completely sane. Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice? Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure? Can I say...? I think it should be Darryl. I want an outsider. I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties. No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles] It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now? Then what was this all about? I don't care. They can just vote. I insist. I don't think I should. Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly] I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I'm telling someone how to do somethin'. I go on with a long description and then I say, "and shove it up your butt." It's stupid, but it's my thing now. [starts attacking plankers] Kids, don't try planking. It's dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] ‘Specially with me around. Because everything makes me cry, so what's the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone. Not enough though. Jim. [motions him over] What are you looking at? Yeah, it can't be nothing. What? No. We need a warning signal. We do. Okay, which side of the list am I on? Yes! Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work. Maybe it's a list of people he's gonna f*re. I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side's the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam. Maybe we're s'posed to do it with people in our group. People in the other group. No, it's not. Here's how we find out. Let's line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let's just size each other up here and left side of the list... att*ck! That's great. Let's do this guys. I love you so much. [starting to cry] Okay. [turns to computer] Okay. Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street? Sesame street. Elmo, god's sake, it's the Elmo era. Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn't you agree. I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone. Jim, shut the door. This is just gross. Night. Yes. Me do. Alright. Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital. But save time. More success. Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world. See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China. I'm sorry," L"? How on earth are we supposed to sell...? Justine. She said she's coming by later. Nah man, we get along now. Real well. Double.[Andy knocks on Jim's desk] What's up, guys? Just thought we'd have a little rap session, talk about business...see how things are going? Ahem... If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You're not making any sense. You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna. Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici's favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies. Of course. Great.[Angela walks away] That's a tablecloth. That's a crazy amount of points. Well, what do you want? Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter] Really? Swear to God, hope to die. Now let's get to work! Yeah! Whoo! [Group cheers] [hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen's bananas. T-bag bone... Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here? [On the phone] You've got to unleash the power of the Pyramid! You think it has something to do with that incentive program? Bah...I think people thought I was kidding when I said that. Hundred and twenty points. Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.] Just need a second outside. Yeah. I don't know what I'm doing. My ass is only so big, I mean I can't do this everyday. No one expects me to go through with this, right? [removes tape to reveal tattoo of puppy] It's a Nard Dog! [group cheers] That's my nickity-name! I love it, I love it! You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to "I'd rather be snowboarding" bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures. OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on. This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron] Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers] And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds] Why would we take the dog? Nein. Sits. [snaps as dog calms] Goot. [Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it. That'll work. What's that come to? Like, what did they each win? At least. I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] "Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug." And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids? And then my handsome husband... Would bring me a flavored coffee. Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters. Jim! How 'bout you? That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl. Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift] [On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back. Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday. [Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence. Like baboons or elephants. Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh. So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings.... And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France. Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy. Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again? Message in a Bottle, The Postman... Kevin Costner. You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it! It's not the greatest one either... And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in sh*t showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor] I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim? OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them. Jim? Tell them what it's called. No Jim, tell 'em what a name is. [laughing] Señor Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim. No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Señor Loadenstein. We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-w*r brownstone at the top of a mountain. Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world. Just like now. Oh.. How'd it look? What? [Stanley enters office laughing] Morning, Stanley. Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it. It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time. And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you. They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by. I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret w*apon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs] MR. RYAN HOWARD! I'm Walter, Andy's younger brother. Tuna, right? And this must be your lovely wife Pam [looking at Meredith]. Hell no. She wishes. Set that down. [grabs waitress] Present yourself. Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper. What are they doing? Nice touch. Who cares. MR. JAMES HALPERT! Stop forgetting things. MR. JAMES HALPERT! What? Idiot. MIS... MI... What are you doing? Put it on, man. Three Kings. Alright. ...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black. No! My wife does not believe in ghosts. Hey! What do you mean? I saw a ghost. It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date. [answers phone] Pam Halpert. Is it called Ghostbusters? It didn't look like that. Ok fine I'll draw him. [hangs up phone and draws] Try a box jelly fish. What are we talking about? I grew this party up real fast. Get out of here little kid party. Nobody loves you. And clean up your room! Grownups are going to use it later! Oooh! I'm using it. I'm about to play Starcraft with him [points to Dwight]. Yeah I'm serious. I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person. Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical? Really. Exactly. [to camera] What am I up to? I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim. I'm not gonna lie to her, either. One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer. End the mistakes. That is all I ask. [gets up from chair] And you can't have a favorite Iron Chef. It depends entirely on the secret ingredient. Sometimes I feel you don't know food at all. Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine. Oh yeah. P.S. We should should k*ll him. No, it's an accountability booster. Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger] No questions. Accountability booster. Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like...z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that. How about Scrantonstrangler666. Wha...what's Dwight's mothers name. Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something. Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash. I'll see you next week Will. [at the club, playing squash] Jim what are you...What a surprise. Yeah. A game or a match? Good policy. Sensible. Smart. In the box. Isn't it supposed to be, "Drive safely"? Sounded like mine. Well, it's mine. You took it out of my bag. Can I have it? Yep. [censored beep] ha, Jesus. Nah, it's good. Yeah. It's the standard one. The one everyone has. It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting? Take it easy. Nice and easy. Oo! You alright? Skinned knee. Oo, a little ice on that maybe. Hey – asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single? You doubt it? Why do you doubt that she's single? Hey. Helen Mirren. Hot? Huh. What about Cathy? Yeah. Do you think she's hot? I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive? You don't find Cathy attractive? No, I don't. Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake. Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single. I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas? Mike Tibbets, really? Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive? Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z. Yep. Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch] I'm fine, I'm totally fine. Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim. Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again] I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance. [to Jim] Oh, that line from Zoolander? It was from a deleted scene so we were both right. [to Jim] Yeah? Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it. Come on. [mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs. Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert? [mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten. Jim, are you serious? Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we? Do you find Cathy Simms attractive? Ah, see, was that so hard? Really? Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure? When was the last time you went to the doctor? Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you? It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man. But... hey, Cece's toothbrush. Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness! Never cry wolf. Oh! Oh my goodness! I'm really in labor! This is happening! Oh! And one for you. Whoa, where you going? Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists. Thank you. Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought. Exactly. Now do you know the Civil w*r soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he d*ed. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? [holds up flag] I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars. Spangler Springs is a mile this way. Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there. I guess he follows orders. Even without an audience you're still at it. Our office has a disease. And it goes by many names. Sarcasm. Snark. Wisecracks. You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes. That's what you did with this trip. You don't like the hats? Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never h*t the sweet spot. [to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums] What are you doing? Give that back. Come on! Oh that's real creative. I could, but I just don't feel like it loser. Standing. Don't! Standing. [signing his name] Andrew... Baines... Bernard. What was that? Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let ‘er rip. What do you hate about this place? Jim? Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know. That's Gerald. [hands phone to Jim] It's not that kind of ladle. Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this. [sees Jim's abandoned car] That's weird. Well, he's gotta be around here somewhere. Okay. What about your friend? So I think you know what we want to know. Yes. Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness. For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here? That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day. Jim... Answer the question, please. All right. Thanks. I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas. So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is. Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time? Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye. It wasn't either of you. I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm] Hey! Hey! Respect the hat! Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay. Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person. I will look so handsome for you, Darryl. Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room] Wow. [on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye. Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was att*cked by this blood thirsty rabid creature! Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up? Hello? Lacerated hand here folks. Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA. Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it. Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand? No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs. Come down right away! Yes, I was quilled. Henrietta. I was too embarrassed! [group laughs] Is that Cici? Oh my god. How could somebody do that? Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this? Dwight? Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is f*re-able. It's, I mean. That's no accident. What? Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as sh*ts show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!! You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends? Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends? No...I don't, hmm, I don't know. By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work. Alright, I'll tell Dwight. Christmas miracles do happen. Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?  I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah! You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane. I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter] [writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper? [gasps] Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause] There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia. It's trivia. But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase... Yeah? You like it? All right. And you guys thought this was a good idea? A-team. Okay. [leaves] Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine. That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington. All right, boards up. Let's see who got it. "Lamar Odom" is what we were looking for. "Lamar Odom" Thank you. [scattered cheers] All right, guys. After nine rounds, let's check the scores. In first place, with nine points, it's Aesop's Foibles. [Oscar's team touches fingers] The Queerenstein Bears have seven points. [a team of hairy men growl] Dunder-Mifflin A-Team has four points. Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs] Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim. My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but... I'm selling the house, actually. It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. [Jim laughs] Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim? What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard? [to Jim] Hey, late guy. Oh. DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight. You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine. You should see the whole thing. I'm just about to give the tour. Join us. You must see what you were laughing about. And Gabe-y makes three. Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it. I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan. I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears. And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness. To madness. Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl. Yes! Woohoo! Bravo! Hey! Tuna! He's back. Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap. [grabs Jim's wrist] Hand roll. How was jury duty? What was the case? Did you send him to the slammer? Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] "Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm." Not coming, have plans. Okay. Oh, I'd love to but, um- Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets? Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change. Yeah. I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story. You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's. So this whole h*t and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop... And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane? See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert! Yes! Andy, get out here. That's good enough for me. [exhales again] I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before. No, not after what I told Dwight about f*ring you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up? Do you know why you never heard of it? Covered it up. Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar? It's the empanada guy. Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets. Why? Why? [looks at Jim] We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down? I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your [bleep]. This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow. What? What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt. You won't see- [to Cece] You want a giraffe? Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here. Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you! Oh, hi Stanley. Jim. Hi everybody! How about a little visit? All right. No, but that would've been a really good idea. No, she brought you drawings. Oh! Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style? Shh. [cries] Mama, mama, mama. Oh, it's okay, sweetie. It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay. I don't know what that means. We're gonna circumcise him. No! I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier. Okay, we're going. Shh, shh, shh. You want to grab her? Here we go, here we go. [groans] We'll see you tomorrow. Hey, we'll be just fine.  So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So- ...we wanted to say thank you- I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque. Kathy. Why? Does he think you're going to Florida? Well, let's hear it. I like it so far. It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida. Total golf text. Send it. Ok, read it back to me. Absolutely. Works for me. Well done. And we managed to k*ll the entire morning. Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good. I think you need to go to Florida. It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be.. I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need? I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much. Jim is essential to th- Andy, Jim is just too...essen-... This is stupid! Cut. He doesn't even want to go. Oh my god. Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer] Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says "I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt" unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight's forehead] oh. What was that? So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate. Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store. Right. Think different, from Apple. Alright [kiss] Bye. Call me when you land. Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool! Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees "IT WAS DWIGHT" written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream] Cool, for your kids? Who says none of us are diarrheal? Very funny, Jim. I'm gonna set your face on f*re. Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod. You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins. Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. [ringing continues] Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service? How was the drive? Life is short. "Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse." That's one of my mottoes. Quick query, Halpert. You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping penis? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, [points to her head] and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. [slow clap] I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. [points to Jim] After you decided I wasn't "a good fit-" Uh. [eats antacids] You didn't poison me, it's just stress. What is the antidote? [on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use? Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over! It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate. It's whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle] Or do you only drink with your kids? Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy. Jim, are you in? Sounds like a hoot. I'm in. Dwight? [groans] Stop moving! Arrest Jim. He poisoned me. Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning. What's our presentation about? I want that vice-presidency. Aw, let him do it. Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim? Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or- That's a hobby, unless it's for food. Waste of time. That's just a verb. Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real 'Talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about. Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' [chuckles] no, no, no, no... Oh, you get kicked. Well, that's how I played it in college. Oh, that is lovely. Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.[Cathy knocks on Jim's door and Jim answers] Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here? Okay, yeah. Cool... [Jumps onto bed] Is this March Madness? I love March Madness. LeBron James. No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.[Knock at the door] My mini bar is oddly out of rum. Oh, hello. [laughs with Cathy] Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier. mm-hmm. [about to leave] uh-huh. You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] ...ahhmmm... excuse me... What?! Not now, I'm busy. Where did you see it? Describe it. Could be a bat weevil... Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy? Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured? Pshh. That's a bedbug. Everything's a joke. Check your hair! [checks Jim's hair] God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this. You are clean. Okay... One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh] Is this really nessecary? Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower. We wait. [Shower starts] Come to papa. Oh.[Packer and Nellie are speaking softly to each other. Gabe sprays his inhaler into Packer's drink.] Nope, I wasn't bitten. Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect. If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me. No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long. No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first. Such a chorus girl. Yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster... Okay, cool. Thanks... I know, I'm a pig, right? [giggles] Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously. Oh my God, what are you thinking? I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me? Can you... without running to the other side of the room all night? Okay. [Sits next to Jim.] I am so cold. Hey, just so you know, me and you... I don't think that's ridiculous... Dot, dot, dot... dot, dot.[Jim walks into his room to find a bathrobe on the floor] What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right? [wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug? [coughs and moans] Oh stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop it! [runs out the door] You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy. Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had. [at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight? Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I h*t rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn't even get a callback. The black one. I never stood a chance. Okay. I wasn't really sure which one of you is Chuck. This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog. Are you trying to sabotage this entire event? We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? "Hello. Hi sweetie. It's Jim. I'm calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape." Sabre. It's time to come home. You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea. On my God. You're so embarrassing.  My mom would say the best stuff, though. And you know that I'm capable of this. What did you think of the presentation? How long has he been in the bathroom? Jeez! What's he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates] Are there any bloggers around? I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy! You are gonna bloody ruin it. You're gonna bloody ruin it because you're a no-good half-assed cock-eyed... Jim -- Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I'm telling you... if you don't do this, [whispers] I don't stand a chance. Please, Jim. Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan's costume and check out his notes. Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long? Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner? You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.[Coldplay's Clocks] It's true. Yep. Psst. [applause] All right.  Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues] [to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh] Don't even care! Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked. Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win. [drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart] I'll let Dwight have his fun. Today will not be his day. I'm gonna t*nk the Sabre store at the presentation to the board. Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers. But, there's a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim? [Jim shakes head] They're cheap. They're unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone's wives do us. You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper. What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you? What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh] Different guy. [interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh] [on phone with Jim] He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna f*re him. Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this. Did you actually try your hardest? Don't talk to me. If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do. [straightens tie in mirror] Showtime. You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick. Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money? [rolls eyes] Jim, come on. Uh-huh. Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna k*ll the store? And he's gonna f*re me? [smiles] That's two things. Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today. You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye. [Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help! AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest. [attempting to break from Jim's grasp] Ah! [clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix- My wound hasn't healed yet. Oh, man! [trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs] I was trying to go- Ok, ok. Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you. No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie] This. Ends. Now. [picks Jim up] Rrahh! [both fall] Anything else you need to talk about? Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida? [to Jim] Hey, stranger! Aw, I missed you. Well, I guess it doesn't look that cool either. But, it's been up there a long time, so it's become a pretty big deal. I was still thinking of going back to school. k*ll the balloon. k*ll the balloon. k*ll the balloon. k*ll the balloon. k*ll the balloon. [pops loudly] [cheers and applause] Allow me to solve your problem, then. Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie? That one looks empty. Not much we can do about this until he gets here. Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim. -Right. So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo? You didn't even stop to pee? Gross. [answering Andy's phone] Proctology. Jim? He's here in Tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down. What do you mean, take my job? Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later. I like working here. Those who can't farm, farm celery. Six percent, I know my worth. Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive. I am not. Huh. Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown? Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss. Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor? When two animals are having sex, one of them... ... is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua-- this isn't very helpful. You're gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor. All life is sex. And all sex is competition. And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it? My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is? Oh, great. Jim, time for your review. Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise? Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell? I'm Tinkerbell. But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist. She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell? I do. [applause] Come on everyone... I already spent the money. Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card? It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache. Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this! [bell dings] Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him? Yep. I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible? I'm still not sure why this woman is even here. [lifting box] Ugh! Ow. Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? "Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is." Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic. Hey, what's up? [shouting] Haulin' cube! So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad. No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card. What? I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account. [finds shoe box] Ooh. I have to see these shoes. Oh! Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend. Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend. You read my mind. Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician. [walks in] Oh. Why not call... That's awful. What kind of restaurant. I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one? Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this. God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician? What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you. Jim, could you give us a hand? Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam d*ed. [laughter] So we've established- Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you're my volunteer. Come on over here, huh? no, Nellie, she- Oh! Big guy, huh? How's the air up there? Watch out for... birds. [chuckles] All right, let's uh- let's do some card magic. Now, what I want you to do is... I want you to pick a card just by looking at it. Do not say what it is. Little known fact about me. Before I was a magician, I used to work at a rope factory. Yes ma'am. I got my eyes open. Let's just- let's go. Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley. You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain? Lots of things are cozy in the rain. Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have. Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl. Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby. Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love? Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog? Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it. That a couple of times- Yeah Jim, get it out there. Okay, stop. Ooh, ooh! Boo! Ugh. Eww! You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul? "Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches." "He is a drifter out to sea." It's just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft... Smokey Robinson Pam. He d*ed like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know. Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now. Okay well, that's a relief! Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go! Yeah... Who's opening? Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this. What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it. I know! We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it. Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote. Whoa! Are you-- Twice! For real? Life is Downton Abbey. [Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So? Hm-hmm. Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes! Well, Dwight, yes! You certainly are a record breaker! Your donation is the largest we've ever received at over 34 thousand dollars! [applause] Yeah, you never get used to that. He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse. Absolutely, it's awesome-- Maybe you would think it too! [silence.] I'm sorry, it's just I don't get to be in a lot of human conversations. Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on! Yeah, I do. I have that. Core's critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One – lengthen. Two – elongate. Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who's the strongest? Well, there's only one way to solve that – flat curl contest. I love the burn. The burn is where I live. Speed set. One. Two. Oh, thank you. Five. Six. Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over] I don't need your help. Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they're rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it's a little much? ...Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that's what it feels like. Good, we have a deal? Thanks so much Earl. And they said it couldn't be done. Boom! Lot going on guys. What's happening? That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It's like a festival of poo. Yeah, and we're not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes. No, Jim, the butt, in his butt. Shh... shh... [vomits in trash can] You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one's that guy? Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to – how do I put this – steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud. Yes. They're New York. We're New York. Sate line is the dividing line. That's the way it's always been. Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside] Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first. Damn it! Wha – what is this supposed to be? Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It's got a hula skirt and a blue nose. What? It's him! Do something! Get out! Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That's it? Oh, that's great. That's like a five second delay. Come on, let's go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? h*t the nos. Yeah. h*t the nos. Yes. Got it. Go. [Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator] Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh. Ah! [Harry walks in] Go, go! Take the stairs! Now! Just run! Take the stairs! I'll stall him. Go! I'm gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We'll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down. No, no, it's not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. It's... Big Red Paper Company. Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst? Jim couldn't land me in a thousand years. So what would you do if you weren't selling paper? What? Nothing? I'd like to sell one big thing, you know? Like... a plane. One sale, I'm out. Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them. I know why you're doing this, Dwight. [Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim! [wearing janitor outfit] Hi guys. [whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you? Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping. [enters with the kids] Family picture! What? Honey, we talked about this. Yes, and then we decided that was crazy. No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember? We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child. No, no. But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them. Yes! And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y. Yeah? Okay. Oh, great. Thank you. Okay. You ready? There we go. I'll just stand here? Sir, could you look into the camera? Sir. Up here. [whistles] Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good. I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine. I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back! Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum "Suck It" to the U.S. m*llitary. Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. [drinks coconut penis energy drink] Why'd they add coconut? I miss original. Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place. For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great. Kay, well, you had that interesting thing. Yes, Jim's friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college. And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too. He said if it takes off he's gonna buy us a new car. And that was our summer. No thank you. My name's Pete. Jim, get ready for the battle of your life. The new guys. Dwight Jr is after my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub. Wait, sales—what sales meeting? The new guys called a sales meeting? There's no belt above black. Is there a belt above black? That's me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete's foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack. Sure, boxing, tennis. NASCAR. The Amazing Race. You mean horses? Ah, I like the Red Sox. I'm from Vermont. Ok. Good talk. Well, I'm still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list. You ready? Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I'm about to prove it. Dwight Schrute! A wheel wants to spin, Pam. [referencing the ‘tiny wheel'] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore] [exiting house] Thanks, mom! Yeah. I'm afraid he's only gonna have hot dogs. Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs. Ah, thank you! [embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel] [as Jim receives and declines a call] Who's that? [sarcastically] Ha-ha. Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. [wads up Nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her] Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice. Are you kidding? Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a b*llet on that one. [sees Jim's reaction] Just kidding. Thanks...aw. Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it'd take off? Yeah. What about you? What are you doing? Oh, cool. Hey bro, stop wasting time with this haircut. [referring to Jim] He's got a fifty-thousand dollar sports car. Cheers. So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you. [approaches piano] [in the car] We still surprise each other. You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with- Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was- In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] Do we know everything about each other? Tell me one thing about you I don't know. [laughs] Um, ok. [thinks but says nothing] And you thought you guys were millionaires. Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember. Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. sh**t, I knew that one. The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee] [whispering] John Stamos. Uh-huh. [as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question. [in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow! Yeah, right? OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there. OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago- I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he h*t on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know. Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me. [looks knowingly back] Just tell me. Fake Who are you?Fake You're not Jim. Jim's not AsianFake Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?Fake How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!Fake 30.Fake [to Jim] I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch. You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ‘em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching. There he is! You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon! Good. Good. And—[Nellie hits the car against the bushes] I'm done. I gotta get out of here. It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets. Like what? What kind of job? Hell yeah! That sounds awesome! I love Philly! It's not even a thought— What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man! And Pam's into it? Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real. Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I—Nellie, this is brilliant! [sees Jim] Hey! Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this. Fail! Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK? Oh that wasn't...that didn't work. That was not the right..[Group protests] [Jim rushes to open door for her] Thank you. You got it. [to Jim] What are you doing? You popped one kernel. Correct. I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way. Had 'em all my life. No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim. [scoffs] Yeah right. [Dwight moves mouse pad over his crotch] Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. [notices popped kernels in the bag] What the? Some of these kernels have crowned. Andy! [Jim mimes basketball sh*t] Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way? A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb. In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour. Whoa! Boy, I will hammer spank your rear. It's a medical thing. I'm good. I.. Oh my god! Ah! You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine. [Pam leaves work bus] What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage. It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas. Yo. Dudeces. No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site. Yes! [Group cheers] Oh! Yes! [Group cheers, Dwight moves to driver seat] Get your foot behind the yellow line. Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately? No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him. Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge? Next stop pies! I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas. That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The t*nk are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up. Hey honey, I don't think we should push him. Stop ordering me around, Jim! Pies! OK, fine. You win. Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in Jim's lap] Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie. Oh my! [to Jim] Go up and check on him. He's upset. What? I'm barren, Jim. My trouser hives are void of honey. I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building. You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank? That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs] Alright then. Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive? What position did you use to conceive? Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright. [Erin cries, Nelly comforts her] It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you. You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it. Bildenkinder. Oh! [Jim reenters bus through hatch] Hey! How'd it go? Yeah? Well, actually, rhubarb is- the one pie that I don't. Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other] Oh my god. I'm getting so stuffed. My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ... I am Dr. Cinderella. No, I'm a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen. Uh, Jim, you're not dressed up at all. So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me? Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me. You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael's Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I'm so not prepared. Yeah. I mean, listen if we're gonna do this thing, we should do it right. I kind of am. It's crazy. Jim. Look I'm eating you. So the workspace looks awesome. I've also been running the numbers and between our backers and our own investments, we're looking great for a full year on this. Oh Jim, I explained everything. So you're all set. Wow, well what level of investment were you thinking about? Welcome aboard! Hey, how'd it go? Did you end up investing? How much? About ten? Wow. Wow. No yeah. Yeah. So did everybody ... Did everybody end up investing ten thousand? What? They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars? So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player? [singing ‘I'll Be'] Talk about it now. We said some. We said ‘some.' Doesn't mean you're the best singer ever. d*ck. They lost me when they sang ‘Monster Mash'. That song obviously glorifies the occult. Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to? No I'm just, I'm saying, what would happen if they didn't sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be sh*t? No! No, I'm interested. I mean I think everybody's interested in why they have to sing it. Andy's family had a total meltdown. His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman. The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so.. [wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...[Group protests] ...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason. He's gonna be disappointed. That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom. Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled! [Jim runs panicked into break room] For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich. Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson [points to Jim]. Please sir! Spare him. Please. And you didn't call Jim - that seems significant. No, he shouldn't. Can you go instead? I can't. I have the thing. [on phone] Okay lets get started. Uh,, well you're the only one ‘on' - we're all here. That's the winter season., three months. Are you at your office right now? [laughing] Uh, yeah, that sounded kinda spooky-sexy, over here Halpert. Whoa. [laughing] I think there's been a bit of a mistake. We're trying to reach Jim Halpert, not Batman. Uh, yeah... Okay, yeah. This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun. [on phone] It was in what? Jim, we're having a lot of trouble hearing you. Where are they? Who was messing with my van? [on phone] Jordan wore them for nobody? We're not following you, Halpert. [to Clark] Do you have a valid passport? [on phone] Hey, it's Colin. I know. Don't worry about it. It's just... it's not totally working. Yeah, well, it's not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I don't know how we're gonna do this. Sure you don't want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one. Are you avoiding your phone call? What? Yeah, right. As if. Last week Jim wasn't there, and they named the company Athlead. Tell them your opening line. I think it's good. He likes fishing. [phone vibrates] Oh, look at that. Yeah, he's free anytime. Not a problem. [on phone] Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there's a crisis -- the more I think about it -- They did? Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work. Why should we help you? When is my birthday? I don't know, because we're not friends. Now we're talkin'. 00. Keep in mind, once I leave, there's no turning back. There we go. All right, let's do it. You know what? I don't know where the years went.  ‘Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don't even recognize them. Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don't know. Nice! Yeah. Don't be pushy Jim. It's tacky. No, there's wine in here. Is it white wine? [to customer] Can you help me? [groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha! I don't like him either.  And yet I really like him. [chuckles] [laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes. Shuckin' your peas. Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.  I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt. Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness? Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever. What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel. No! [Holds up a picture] This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style. I'm on it. Movie is starting. [Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man. So you sure you remembered everything for your trip? What else could you possibly be forgetting? You have never been cooler. You're welcome. It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib. Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook? I feel like [Pam look's out the window and camera pans out in The Office]--Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem. [Cackling] Ohh...[In a German Accent] Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I! Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! [Runs over to Stanley and points at his stomach with a stick] Ohh...Too much strudel. No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel. No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable. No, impish or admirable. I decided earlier. Of course I checked it. I checked it more than once. Impish or admirable. No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder [puts a mouse trap in Pam's bowl] In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.[Kevin giggles as Dwight is poking him with a stick for being impish] Oh, really? Already? It's a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going? But you work tomorrow. But we were gonna break the pig rib. Remember? No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present? Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! [Jim holds his hands like a bowl] I judge your year as impish. [Hits Jim with stick] [Hits Jim three more times] I judge you impish! They're not abandoning the party. [h*t's Jim again] Just--Just--Hey![Dwight hits him again] [Hits Jim some more] Impish! [Chases Jim out] Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in][Everyone groans. And in his office, Daryl continues to drink the gluhwein] Well...this is it. Shut up. I'm trying to be serious. I can't believe this is actually happening. Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You're gonna be great. Okay. Love you. No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt. Jim! Oh--Oh my god![Pam goes to hug Jim, but Dwight runs and hugs Jim first] What happened? Did you miss your bus? [Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it! [To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim] You! [Looking at Jim confused] That's great. Thanks, man. I shall come by at your convenience. [Claps his hands once, spins around] Whoo! To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops. No. Bynum, obvious monster and the three point sh**ting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip] Oh, the Nets are super tough. [Jim in pain from his lip] The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible. Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table] Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family. I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos. Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting? Jim, limo's here. Oh, call me later! Good luck! Love you. Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me. Yeah, take some home if you want. No, Mr. Irving called. Said he'd rather meet you at his private court. I hope you don't mind me bringing you out here. I can't get my knees under a desk. Well, do you think you can sink one from deep? Okay. [Jim sh**t the basket and it goes in] Wow, Halpert's got game. It's your wife? You better take it. Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went. He's really making you work for it, huh? Great. I am k*lling it over here. [drops mayonnaise on the ground] Jim, I gotta go. No problem. Hey Jim, what size do you wear, man? I got a pair of japanese Nikes with your name on them. What do you think? You're Kareem, coming to help. And it went like this. [Jim's phone starts ringing] That's it. Yeah, you show me how. [on phone with Jim] I hope you've been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it's time for another episode of "Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire". Oh, god, this again? You're Stinky. Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim? How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour. ...And I want to reach every demographic possible. We're talking weeks here, not months, right? Alright. Good. Good! I just wanted to see you! Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out! Wow, this place is... so great. I had no idea – on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky. If this company's going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it. Sure, no problem. Yeah. "Mandate"- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friends... I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar? I'm a laywer. I'm the only one here who can honestly help. [group chuckles] Not us. Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail? I think I'm a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail. Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight! Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ... You don't remember? [on phone to Jim] There's nothing down here. Pete and I work well together -- not that there's anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I'm into girls. Not that I'm into Pete. Ugh! What was the question? Hey Jim. Peter Rowley at Bridgeport Capital requested a meeting at lunch. Uh sure. No problem. [on phone] Hey, Halpert, what's the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you're stealing Darryl too. When will it end? You won't stop until you've poached us all. No. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let us lose me. Bye, Dwight. Let's call him.[line trilling] Hey, Hon, are you close? What? Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren't gonna make it. I want Daddy. Of course. Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something. Bye, Daddy. Peter, please. We completely understand your concerns here. Let us just show you the latest projections. Jim? Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he's gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--[cell phone vibrates] Hey. So, how's it going? I'm so sorry. [sighs] Oh, I'm sorry. I feel like you've already been working insanely hard. Um, actually, funny story -- I didn't get it. I shouldn't have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all. No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part. Yeah, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it. Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit? I don't know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there. You know what? I-- I-- I don't think you want to start a conversation with me about what's fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever -- Jim. We need you. I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want. Yep. Yep. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam. I chose my words very carefully. When are you talking to David Wallace? Too late. My hopes are up. And this chair's gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha! No doy! [laughs] No earbuds! [both laugh] Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview? Thanks, dude. You—you sure it's okay? ‘Cause you're kinda— Oh, Dove Men. Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this? Thanks, dude. Why? [exhales] Wintergreen. Yeah, good nose. Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault. Here's an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others. [on phone] Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later. Really? That's interesting. ‘Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, k*lling it lately. Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work. Yeah. And I know we have a call scheduled for later – Yeah. What's up Jim? It's okay. Go ahead, Jim. Okay. Jim, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. [whispers] I'd love to invest. [patting Darryl's hair] It's dense. Like bread. Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. And I was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife. Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it's your call. I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray. Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal. Yes. Thank you. Amazed. What? This is such bullcrap! Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them? Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever. Yeah. No limit on w*apon class, right? All right. I think that went well. Oh, cool. Hey Clark. Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate. Of course. Okay. Bye. Aah! [on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too. Hey. Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates. Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom. Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room. I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. [boom microphone bumps her head, she smiles] I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian. Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to h*t first. Yes sir. [notices Jim's using his coffee mug] [points to Jim and Darryl] This is the team. You too... Darryl. It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes. That's my go-to thermos. That's all. No big deal. No big deal. Nah, nah... [as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that. I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak? Oh, hey. I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool? All right. I didn't say anything. Excuse me? What you need flour for, Jim? What? You making bread? What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel? All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all. We good. Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys? Seeya. [playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on! Damn! [to Jim] Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day. [makes magic trick hand gesture] Alakazam! [eating] These are gross. Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill. It's with Brian and Alyssa. I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life. That sounds nice. Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands] Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK. He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly. Yeah. We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb. [obviously flustered] Yeah. At least my crying won't get you fired. OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why? I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress. It's not Brian's fault. Yes. [hugs Erin] Come on. Totally. Oh? Are you sure? [obviously hurt] Yeah. OK. [they begin to leave] [sees it's a drawing of hers, framed] Wow. I didn't know you kept this. Thank you. I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight. Yeah, I do. [whispers] hello! Hi! Hey, do I look ok? [pointing to Jim's bluetooth headset] What's that? Is that a- Thanks. Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me. Hey, Jim! We've got Trent Edwards on the line. [on phone] hey! Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so- Eight? Really? Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can k*ll four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight. Hello? Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne? Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job. Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate. [laughs] You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny. So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura. Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least. Guess what poster he had on his wall? MmMm. MmMm. You're getting colder. [laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green. I don't know, but it's interesting right? He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day. Mmhm. I don't know. I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this. Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton. My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt. Keep them. I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a b*tch. I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face] I miss her so much. That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage. [on phone] Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week. I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'. [laughs] Um. You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen? Oh, oh OK. [sighs] Um, Ok. Well? Yeah, sounds good. Ok. Ok. 19 is aight" Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy. I mean that's the guy's name, right? ChobbleGobbler? Hey there, Ryan. Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh. [to camera] Eat Fresh. [eating soft pretzel] We've all changed. "C'mon, I can do that." Subway sandwiches. How? I didn't say Subway sandwiches. It's called playing the subtext. I actually wrote a screenplay, it's called "The Big Piece" Half biopic and half superhero movie. A mild mannered professional baseball player, Ryan Howard- The space dust does it. I actually brought a- some copies of my script if you guys wanna read it together. Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it. Look, if you give me a chance I can, I- [Pam leaves] Pam. That'll pay for the exploding helicopter. "Suddenly, the evil thugs break in to the stadium. The Big Piece hits baseballs at the evil thugs." Yeah, Jim. "Oh yeah!" "They kiss. It is super emotional. Like in Toy Story." Keep reading then. Um another thing. I'm gonna need you to get me the rights to Darth Vader. We can look into it. We need Darth. We'll go after Darth then. That's what we gotta do. I mean, we've having issues. It can't hurt to talk about them, right? Oh, sure. Let's do it. Let's get personal. Whoa. Oh, yeah, no, it's okay. I can handle it. Um, so... [chuckles, snorts] Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren't in couple's counseling, are you? Oh, God. Yes, it is your mistake. He's lingering. So annoying. I'm gonna k*ll him. How can I help? I'm here. [slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay? You're really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator. He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he shouldn't be rewarded for that. I feel like he's always making these decisions for the family, and then I'm left playing catch-up. Well, what's a little while? I mean, what's the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn't know when it's gonna end. I'm sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don't want him to do it anymore, and I don't want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly. W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere. I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times. So, we had couple's therapy. And we have homework. And we're also supposed to speak our truths. Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy. I'm not giving up. I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher. Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea. Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting. I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar. Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers] Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. [Jim hangs up phone] I appreciate the sacrifice. Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth? I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok. Jim! [hands him umbrella] Alright, have a good trip. Bye. [walks away] I love you.  It's great. The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts. Nice morning, too. Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent's putting me up for a furniture commercial. Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what's up? Back in the small pond? Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on. Tell me about it, you know? I've been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don't know if I'm wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup. Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly w*apon in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and— I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided. Ah! [throws punch] That's how it's done. I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole. Right. Yeah. But, you know, I've actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I've earned this. I mean, you know? it's okay. You can sit in the annex. I'll come visit you. Andy sings beautifully. And he's really good at dancing. He's a good speaker. But there's just something there you don't want to look at. Yeah, a little bit. Oh, no, no, no. No it's cool. It's cool, man. I'm sure you and I will have our own thing. Oh! I'm am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue. So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on. Again! And I'm looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy? You sure? Yeah. No, I don't think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can't make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it? Yes. Yeah. Oh, boy. Um— I could give you some beginner stickies? Here you go. Mm-hmm. It's all yours. You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that. Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager's job? Yeah, right. I'm afraid that ship has sailed. Hey. Hi. Um, I have a question. Oh, I had a question. I did! Super important. Okay. All right. I did not come back here just to see you. I don't know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out. I had no idea. And here I've been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin' sheep. Oh, well, Thursday's tough, because of— They are. Pam. So... I wanted to offer you a new position. Assistant regional manager. Jim. Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot. Uh, dream. Goin' with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn't that right, Jim? Can't you just leave? You talk to Wade and Colin? We got an offer on the table. A buyout. We're in play, baby. they're gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby. Yeah, we did it. Wade said we could do the whole country in three months. Can't do what? No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything. Well, b*rned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America's Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It's a really cool show, it's like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean! Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best. Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we've overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World w*r— Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office. Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting. Is that them again? Maybe you should call back? I will. I will. Welcome. Please take an agenda item. Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. "Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try." [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you. Question. We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they're delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, "Nice jugs"? Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today. Not now! Private time! Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box] Which is, of course... Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me. The power source. A loyal, but bungling apostle. Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore. I'd have to get some more wire and string, but it's doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable? I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind? What are you so excited about? What are you up to? Fine. You'll always have the upper hand, when you've got a good a-arm. Trademark pending. Wow, the honor. God, I envy them. You don't need to repeat right now, when I'm saying it. Alright. I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all. Uh, two. Not even close, Meredith. Come on! Theme song from Saved by the Bell. Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other's minds. You're trying to give your wife this job. A horse. What's the opposite of a horse? Sea horse. Say that? Uncanny. Yeah. I would love a corn dog. No, no, no, no! You don't read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There's no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don't have diplomatic relations. If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then. I'll try this one. [grabbing the coffee] Hot! [over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously? [running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here's your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah! Guess I'm going upstairs. I know. Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant- Me. Yes! [weak applause] Thank you. Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right? Hey. Are you happy? No, I know that you're, like, happy and, like, you had fun today. And that was fun. But what about a year from now? What about five years from now? Because I'm so glad you're back, baby, but I'm just—I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you're giving up so much. Okay. I kind of forced you to do it. Yes, I did. I'm afraid that you're gonna resent me and I'm afraid that— This is not enough for you and I'm afraid that I'm not enough for you. Is that really what you think? Bye.[Dwight throws "Now" beanie at Jim's head] I need you to perform a test. On an innocent baby. Damn straight. Hey, he can handle it. Oh I can so just sit here and cry! What is this? Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red. [throws "now" beanbag at Jim] Now. Go ahead. Ok, um, this is... [leaves DVD with her]—I'll be right back. I was thinking of proposing to Esther today. She's got a ton of great qualities. She's young, she's beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we're third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn't technically incest. Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm. And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up. Angela.[Pam hesitates but puts the DVD into the laptop to watch] Some sort of virus? Oh.[Pam starts the video; title screen reads "Beesly—You think I'll have regrets. I asked the doc crew to help me show you why I won't..."; highlights of Pam and Jim from the documentary play over Snow Patrol's "Open Your Eyes"] You're a good assistant, Jim. That's very true. Get the hell outta here. You got it.[video shows teapot clip from "Christmas Party"; Pam notices the card that Jim took back] Yeah. What's that? One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same. Ooh. [crying] At least I got chocolate. I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it's good for the environment too. [to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom? After 16 years, it's strange sitting across from somebody who isn't Stanley. But...he'll get there. Party time! Whorehouse! Well, you're the bestisch mensch. Great, now we got three hours to fill. Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing. [whispering to Phyllis] That's Baby Wawa, right? Oh, my God! Hello, hello. Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet. Uh, better ask Jim. I love it. And it's Athleap now. And the city is amazing. Yeah. Yeah, it's hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are...for real. Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn't on the itinerary. Jim...wha... Come on! What...what are you gonna whack me, Jim? A bazooka. You remembered. Woo! Okay! Yeah! [to camera] Guten Prank number two. Amazing. Hey, I know you. Are you gonna sit here and cry? [fake cries] Oh, man, never thought I'd say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings] Good old Mose. [laughing] A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose. Right. Which one is that? Mm, hey driver. Why don't you take us to 3030 Adams? [to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim] You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch. Waste of a good hatchet. I heard you say "well" the first time. Guten Prank. What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?! No. We can't see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk. Yes, I'm living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds. No, no, I'm fine. Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don't know. I'm working on something. Awww. I have a question for Jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how you're soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia? Oh, I'm gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank. [chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars] Oh, no. What? Oh, come on. I've never heard of such a thing. Not... significant is a big word... I think you're only a teeny... Jim. That's what she said. Everybody! I need to get out of this dress. Oh, I'm sorry Pam. [whispering] I'm so sorry. They were an hour late. Okay, Okay. Um... so... this past year has been really great, and you've been great and I just... I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn't be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture... and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future. Yeah. Well, you... you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you. Austin? Maybe. I'm doing it for us. Okay. We'll take it. We wanna buy your house. I wanna do this. I really want to do this! [hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God! [taking pictures] Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. All right, that's great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody. Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look? I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing... No, don't say it. You're fired! You're both fired! Thanks Dwight. Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay...in my barn. [playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn't matter. ‘Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same... Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome. I'm happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down. Ooh. [crying] At least I got chocolate. I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it's good for the environment too. [to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom? After 16 years, it's strange sitting across from somebody who isn't Stanley. But...he'll get there. Party time! Whorehouse! Well, you're the bestisch mensch. Great, now we got three hours to fill.

Yeah. Well, you... you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you. Austin? Maybe. I'm doing it for us. Okay. We'll take it. We wanna buy your house. I wanna do this. I really want to do this! [hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God! [taking pictures] Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. All right, that's great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody. Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look? I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing... No, don't say it. You're fired! You're both fired! Thanks Dwight. Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay...in my barn. [playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn't matter. ‘Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same... Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome. I'm happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
