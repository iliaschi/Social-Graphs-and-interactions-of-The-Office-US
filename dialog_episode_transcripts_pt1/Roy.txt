Today, I launch my big charity initiative â€˜Operation Give Back'. Andy has sh*t down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I'd like to see him piss on that one. Congratulations, baby! [approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what? Thanks for inviting us, by the way- That was, that was a surprise. You're welcome. By the way, man, this place is... beautiful. Gravel company? Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So- I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon? No. Roy? No.
