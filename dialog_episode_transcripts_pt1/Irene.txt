Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me. Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug] Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy. Can you just do it? 'Erin123' I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view] What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on? Where's the postage? I mean, there's no shipping label. Yes.Erin and Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you. Hm? [whispering off screen] Why won't she go with him? Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better. So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend. Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. [Andy's phone vibrating] Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger. I don't know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It's fine. I don't think it does that. I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man. [drowsily] I'm amazing. [sighs] Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon. Irene, what would you do without me? Why?
