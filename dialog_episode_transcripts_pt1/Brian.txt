Bye. [quietly crying, sniffling] What am I doing wrong, Brian? Brian. [crying] It's getting tougher. I just didn't know that it was gonna be this hard. Hey Brian, you got a sec? I feel awful. Well, thanks for being a good friend. Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa. Okay. Thank you. Hey, boom guy. When are you gonna boom me? So? So someone need to shut you up! [attempts to att*ck Pam] Whoa. You son of a b*tch! Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers. You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me. Forget about my mural. It's stupid. It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry. Thanks, Brian. [enters restaurant with Pam] Hey, Brian. Sorry we're late. Oh. Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy. Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him. Where's Alyssa? Oh. If the shoe fits. [plays g√ºiro and sings, Kevin echoes] Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight. What? I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me. [grabs Clark] Hey! Hi, um. I'm sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time? Oh my gosh, please, don't. Sure, yeah. Yeah. OK. [Goes out onto terrace] Oh wow, you have a nice view. Oh, thank you. No! So.. Well, the promo for the documentary aired today. Yeah. It's kinda crazy. See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that sh*t of Jim and I up on the roof? Yeah, wasn't that neat? Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed? I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue- I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy? Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out. [Brian laughs] Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera- You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much. How much stuff you got. Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs? So we basically had no privacy for ten years. Um...yeah, I gotta, I gotta go. No I think you explained it.
