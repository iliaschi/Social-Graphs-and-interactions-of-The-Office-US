It's a sophisticated take. I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life. Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch! No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number? What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies... [chuckles] I know. Isn't it something? [handing out vending machine items to everyone] Merry Christmas. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Merry Christmas to you. Oh. What do you say? Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that? I think I know where he is. Mmhmm. Video games. A DSi? A horse. You, are you sure you don't want a pony? You want a real horse? [enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting. [sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
