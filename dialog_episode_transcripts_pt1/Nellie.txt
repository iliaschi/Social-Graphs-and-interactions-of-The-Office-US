But there aren't... A little un-specific. That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with? How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR? Okay. I think that's probably all we need to hear from... That's very... Okay, that's not gonna be... Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that. Yeah, Dwight and Jim tried to get me fired, but I landed on my feet down here in Florida. You see, this cat's got nine lives, and a nine-inch- So who's leading this thing, anyway? I can't wait to meet him. I- It was- Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one. Well that was just one idea. It doesn't have to be winter. Yeah! True love's kiss. Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed. I tell you what though, since my move down to Florida I've really gotten back into hunting big time. I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter. I've spent so much of my life telling myself "Please, don't end up like Stanley," and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes. This is great. This is gonna be great. -features a tech support area. Bring in your product, a bunch of nerdy virgins fix it on the spot. Huge for building loyalty. Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting. All right, who's ready for the next presentation? Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions? desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters. I mean... [Pam giggles] Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle. [show her the wound] Oh God. You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass. That's right. Ah! Not so fast. I miss her too. It's cookies. Let me- let me finish my speech first. Un-be-liev-a-ble. Pretty good. [laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks. English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. [British accent] You're crap. You're wonderful. [back to American] They're mean, but they're incisive. Jason Bourne would kick Bond's ass. Aaaaand he host at his own lame game. Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for. Goat... Alright. [imitates seagull calls] Seagull. [Continues seagull calls] And a wave crashing... a wave crashing.[Packer and Dwight imitate waves] [giggles][Cathy walks over to mini fridge and bends over to take something out. Jim looks away][Packer takes string out of his mouth] Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here. [in a bathrobe] Is crazy gone?[Jim does his signature face][Nellie and Packer are dancing. Gabe winks at Dwight. Packer pukes all over Gabe's slacks and walks off.] [louder] Six months?... um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly. Okay... Seven, one, one, nine... No, okay. Try again... Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one... is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay? [gasps]Wait, the numbers! oh... There you go. Oh yeah? What's the first best? [whispers] Don't let-shh! Hey, my name's Tabitha. I'm camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It's me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it's working. There's already people camped out behind me. Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core. Which Spice Girl? Okay. Uh... Schrute's out to get me. But I'm playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator. Great. Okay. Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay. I'm very sorry. [on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it's your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it's different because it's your wife?  Well, that doesn't make any sense to me. Don't talk to me right now. I'm sorry. I- I know you're my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don't understand is... [voice fades] It's Ryan. "I'm sorry. I lied. I'm not in the bathroom. I can't do it. I need to see my mom. I'm going home." Uh... That's right. Will you just give us a second? okay. Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it.  We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation. Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah! Okay! Come on! [on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball] I am loving the chemistry between you two. I bet. I'm excited. Ah! [sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah! Oh, I boiled some Gatorade. If I may, [assists Nellie] try holding the putter... yeah, with your wrists here. And your thumbs here. Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted] [at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two. [stops whining and charges Jim] Rrrah! Well, looks like Shnoot's a no-show. Guess he wasn't vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I'm your man. I don't see Dwight. He clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible. Right here. What brings you to town? Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony. It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in. No, that's Andy's office. Oh, is it? Nellie. How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far? Good. Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn't it? Now. Let's find you something fun to do here, shall we? We have a manager. Hey... don't listen. I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name. We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone's lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman? Hot tub party? How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us? And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat] Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know. I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever. What? There's no limit to what I think I deserve. Five percent. No less. Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard. Pam. Really? No. I would've said no. [sighs] Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy. Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim? Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle. No. I think... you're a witch. He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture. No, it's not, because you don't really work here. Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises. Yes. No. And we are grateful. She dies. Of course. I own my toothbrush. People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being- [laughing] Nellie, really, nine fifty? Ah. [laughs] I've never believed willpower was very important in a woman. I don't think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason. No, no, no, no. There's something going on. Some stress in your life. [in unison] Yes. Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive. Who's a native? Okay, okay. Nellie? You're clearly under a lot of... stress with the moving and the work situation you've found yourself in. I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic. Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup. Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just... Shh! Dwight! If it would help you to forget, I could h*t you in the brain stem with this candlestick. No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or... No, that's not what I- Cheers. Well Nellie, I'm sorry. If I'd known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician- Okey dokey. [knocks on door] Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about. I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence. Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance. Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better. Get back to normalcy. Nellie! You've been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office- I'm not accustomed to people saying no to me. [laughs] I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until I've had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way. [chuckling] Okay. You can't dock my pay- Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela? Angela? Ooh, she's counting again. Oh, oh! When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this. You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless. It's literally like- Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that. Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant. I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood. You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting. Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So. Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is "impotence." Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy. "Take a man's job, but leave him his b*lls." Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie. Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular? Jinx. Buy me some Coke. I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton. Tip-top shape. No. Um-um. Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything. [on the phone] Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet. Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! [into phone] Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you! No. [British accent] No. Huh? Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, "Tracks of my Tears"? I don't even know what kind of w*apon he has. Could be a Kn*fe, could be a g*n. Could be a series of g*n all lined up to sh**t parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case. Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird. You really re-did Andy's office, huh? I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out. You could go downstairs and ask them? Who knew, right? [speechless.] I... Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US m*llitary bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy! Tacos. I can go get us some tacos. If you loan me some money. $30. $30, yes! Tacos were on sale, eight for $3! Hmhmm. Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I'm not gonna start doubting my drunken self now. Wonderful. So...what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight? Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I'm pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines. Hey. Um... yes. Definitely. With your hair – Certainly. Um... you dropped your cell phone. Yep. No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything. No, I will not. Well – But sometimes he talks about flesh... and bacchanals. No... don't. Just put it out of your mind. Pam, what is your address? I'm gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don't – Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper. Oh, how the mediocre have fallen. Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants... Clean the toilets. Pull the poop out of the toilets. Just, please... Please! Give me something! Thank you. Thank you. Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup. But it's really good- [drops soup] Oh! Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you. No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me. [enters] Happy birthday to Gabe! Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all. It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind. No. Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card? If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well? They're like the new Jim and Dwight. Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it'll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right! What're you still doing here? You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you d*ed. I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It's going to be terrible. All right, who's next? Nellie? Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels? Crap. Sorry, Nellie. Mm, swish. There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge. [whispering] OK. I know you don't really exist. I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn't know. Um... actually I did tell Pam and we decided ‘no'. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I'm thinking there's another conversation coming. And, it's hard to know when that will be. [grinning] Oh boy! What's happening? I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes. Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives. I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling. No thank you. Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation. Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban. The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though. You all right? [Oscar nods] Anything else would be inconsistent. I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don't have a plan. When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan. What the? [follows Nellie into the break room] [taking pen back] Gimme that. You're insane. Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you. [considers then takes cleaver] This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most. [places Nellie's hand on a board and holds up cleaver] This is it. Any questions? It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little [sets up laptop] inspiration. [as he and Nellie watch the movie] Oh god. Yeah. Yes. If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius. Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid. No, like you. You're the stupid one. You're the stupid one. [asks Nellie who is tapping a pen on her desk]. Is everything okay? Great. [yells] Nellie! Get your wrinkly old b*lls in here. Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime. Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try. Executive-summary me. h*t the highlights. As in... You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat. Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!! Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh? What? Sure. So he's not related to Michelle Obama? Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun. Oh—okay. Sorry. Yeah—turn signal. It's exciting to be painting again—those are the wipers. So—the—its—just. There you go! Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, things get so busy with the kids—red light—that it's nice to have that creative outlet—red light! Red light! Red! Red! Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angela's baby. Good. Very good. [cell phone beeping]Oh—no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. "New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P." And then in parentheses, he wrote out "as soon as possible." Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding. Oh—gee—I'm— Brilliant! Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up. I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there's something Jim isn't telling me. Jim? No. Because he just loves me too much. So what did you want to show me? You mean me? Hey! Can I talk you? For a second? What?! No! I-I got this. [Laughs] Okay? [quietly] This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich. And Filipino. But we'll break that to her later. Yeah. You too, huh? Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too. [whispers] Yeah. Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! [mimes punch] Gotta go through me first. Fine. I will give you one minute. You have one minute and your minute has g*n and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it's baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase. A baby what? A human?! Oh. Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so. And I happen to notice you're down to about thirty seconds here. And those sand grains are tumbling.. With fury... Down the sides.. Of the hourglass.. Time's up! [handing Nelly envelope] Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard. [laughs] I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? [laughs] Oh well. Absolutely. I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help. [whispers] Just don't tell Andy, because.. Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages. I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt. I'll take it. Who is it? Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. [takes paper from Nelly] Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok, [reading] blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable. It's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater. Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time. Good luck with your impossible dream. What? Pie! Pie! Pie! Pie! [cheers as they arrive] I changed my mind. [gives Nelly papers] Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it. [laughs] Well, yeah, whatever. So. [walks away] Okay I give up. What are you? Dumatril! Dumatril. This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it's not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It's not for any disorder of the body. [whispering] It's for a disorder of the mind. Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... [whispering] They are now off their meds. Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What's going on Nellie? Talk to me. Hm? It's my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I'm not ashamed of that, But I'm not loving the idea of Dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong. Hi Daryl. I'm just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead. Hey. Are... are you me? Oh my goodness, look. Look at this. [unintelligible mumbling] Look at.. Look at me. [laughs] All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill. Let me out! What? Stop baggin' my head! [whispering] I want some of those pills. Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They're not for me. They're for my cousin Mose. He's just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose. Which one? Mose or the real Mose? [On phone] Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called. The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so... [on other end in conference room] Please hold for Ms. Black. [On speakerphone] Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on. Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris. Yes..? [Takes shirt off] Now then, we were saying. When my workers-gather- That's impossible. [pantless] OK, how is my voice now? This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! [Pam tells Jim to leave the conference room] I dare you to produce one credible source about this. [changing voice] Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure. Get out of here moron! [Jim leaves] uhhhh....no one. No, everything's fine. Tough? I put an innocent man on death row. Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater? Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in. Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ‘gy-na' for your entire meeting. I thought it went great. Nellie, why don't you tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you're listening. Yes. That's a bit extreme. Booo! Weird. Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to Darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having sex. Okay, I got this one. [shouting as tower collapses] Oh no! Kevin! What? No, I wouldn't. I can't even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I'd like to try. Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They're family-owned, but don't let that take away from your edge! Basically I couldn't tell, but I think... I-- I thought they were confused at least... For insulting a client's recently deceased mother. No. [Scoffs] We're out there sweating our b*lls off every day, bustin' our b*lls. We deserve a Christmas party! No, no, no. You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison [Jim and Daryl walk out of the kitchen] for something he may not have done. The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago? Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it! Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and-- What? I was just explaining-- Why wouldn't it-- But why? Are you gonna kiss me? It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? [Phyllis, Kevin, Darryl. and Nellie raise their hands] Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits? Yeah, she ended things. Oh, hey Val. When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head. Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake. An Escalade. Val. Big mistake. Ok, thank you. Is that all? Mmm. That's a good... question. 300 times... [Jim hangs up] 180... Um that comes to 25 minutes. [realizes Jim hung up] Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you. You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy? Can't I just agree without putting my hand in? Yes! The pen delivery went amazing, and now I've got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I'm not one of those people who's just like, "Uh, sure. I'll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back's turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand... they are just sitting here. Pam didn't tell me not to unpack them. Don't want to be a busybody, but I don't want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it's insane! I'm sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I've never had an espresso before. They're good though. Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don't we move the copier into the annex like we've always wanted to? One, two, three! [all gather around copier and push, tearing carpet beneath] Tear up the carpet! Oh, my head is k*lling me. Does anyone have a baby asprin? Let's just forget it. Forget it. [warehouse worker dips donut into golden chalice] Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack. It's just Pete in sunglasses. So far, we're only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big. Yeah. All right, all right.Okay, start over. Loyalty. Thank you. That's none of your damn business. Darryl is dating Val... still. Yes. Yeah. Let's try it out. Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I'm not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force. I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah. Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there. [hugging Nellie] So proud of you, Hon. I'm just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin? Pete's a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat. Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have. Mm-hmm. Ha ha! Yeah, joke's on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up! Oh, no, I really don't think that's a good idea. I guess we don't have a choice. I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn't work then. And now look what he's doing to us. How is it my fault? I'm not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.  He's around here somewhere. Thank you. Yeah? I'm not drawing a butt. Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts... No. She needs her rest again. Thank you. Uh... it... compliment... [to entire office]OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip. [to Angela] Ew! I'll be your foot buddy. 'Kay. [removes glasses] Your boyfriend. He look like a pretty girl. Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount. [to nail manager] Excuse me. [gesturing he and Nellie] Full price. We're not together. She's living a lie. I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf. Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up. Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial... ...feel like I may have glossed over a few... ...minor points. I've been drafting a letter. I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler. Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it. [Toby leaves] You must be pretty horny. [Erin shakes head no] Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did f*re him. Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars. A little ironic that I'm going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel [groups groans] was based on a m*rder TV star. The small screen- Come on! I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar. Did they film that? [on video] Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out. [plays banjo, screen types out "you suck my nutz" from TexasPoonTappa, camera zooms out to reveal Nellie] Whoo! [applause] What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news...thing. It's okay. [chuckles] The hell does he know? I want you to print that out for me. "Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values." Well, we won't be late. I love you, mom. Thanks. [laughs] I wish. Oh, nothing that exciting. Hmm. You know, Jim's kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help. Well, if Pam says she won't go, then—[chuckles] we're gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph. Blah blah blah blah. Jim. They do. That they do. Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest. It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. [whispers] Practically made of plastic. Ok, so is that my spot? Not cool. Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money. Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars. Nellie, this is a competition. Please take it seriously. Sorry. Of course. Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist. It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane. I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder. Fine. [throws plane, doesn't fly] Relax. Oh! I like a little feather in my nuggets. [both laugh] Carla! Carla! [throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside. Yeah! Yeah. Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god! Don't you dare t*nk this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane] Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don't want to meet that person. It's now or never. Well, it's better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right? Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I'm gonna stay on in sales. A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how. 45 that day. Hello! [laughing] Hello! Hi! [goes to hug Nellie] Oh. [laughs nervously] Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr? As it is traditional to the Schrutes, the lovers are standing in their own graves as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do. Oh, I don't know. Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie] Yes. It is. Oh yes it is. 45 that day. Hello! [laughing] Hello! Hi! [goes to hug Nellie] Oh. [laughs nervously] Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York.
