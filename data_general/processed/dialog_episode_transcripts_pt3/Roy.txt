OK. Yeah. What's going on? Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys? You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun. Um... What's in the bag? If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair... It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks. I have absolutely no idea. Have a good game man. Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the uh, jump ball OK? Yeah! [Roy bumps Michael to get around him] OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That's a foul. You have one more free throw sh**t. Come on. [singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter... [Jim pushes Roy to the ground and makes another sh*t] Yes! Take it easy. It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face. I didn't sign anything. Hey. Yeah, he's, uh, pretty good, huh? [to Roy] Let's get you into a tub. Just do it. Nike. Cute, sure, yeah. She's not really my type. [glances at Pam] Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really. Too late, Kev. We're not dating, we're engaged. That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. [Jim sees Roy and trails off] [not looking at Roy] Hi. Roy... Cut it out. Stop it. [laughing] [giggling] Cut it out. Stop. [giggling] [breathless] Stop, I can't breathe. Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting. [on video] Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf? Hey let's go to Poor Richard's. ...because that's what happens every time! No. [Breaks Roy's grip] No, I don't want to go, I don't want to. Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us? Oooh, okay. That was still about me. What? No, I don't. Okay. Thank you. The Natural Redhead] Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is... Yes, this is the one. You remember? Yes! Well, there he is! Hi, handsome! Oh, I don't believe that. Oh, anything is fine. Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here? Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy? My name is Angela. Well, I would definitely have sex with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business. Hey, uh, I have to work late. To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle. I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out. So what are you going to get me instead? What line of work you in, Bob? Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done. I had to. I needed defense. It's defense. It is worth it. You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right? Pam, were you a cheerleader? It's not hilarious, but... Bishop O'Hara. Yes, I did! [chanting] A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E! [chanting] Snorkel sh*t! Snorkel sh*t! No, I'm not going to do that. Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out? He's just sucking up! You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up. I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you? [to Roy in Jim's earshot] ...back so soon. Yeah, right. [to Roy as Jim escapes into bathroom] Are you kidding? [stops dance] Nothing. Yeah, paper business. Is this done? Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office? You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing. Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy... I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is... Oh, no, no. No. Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. I like talking to her too. Yes. Yeah. Yep. Cool, man. I was breathing. I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore. Word. I know. God! What is that? You know this would not happen if we had a union. No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah. It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union? Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving. Hey. I guess, yeah. Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her. I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get mesomethingfor Valentine's Day. Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy. I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom. [People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God! I suck. I do not want to talk about it. Yeah? Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay? Dude, you will not be sorry. Thanks. I never owned a refrigerator. It's okay. I'll see you at home. Okay. Okay, will do. But we have to ask everybody if you used any money to buy anything and forgot to report it, or... You would have to take some from petty cash. In Oscar's drawer. Kevin, why are you giving him instructions on how to steal? I miss that. [loud sigh] Chicken. Excellent, thanks. Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food. So we froze it. But I'm, I'm doing well. I have my own apartment. I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks. No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel. Hi. I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who d*ed, and then I want you to say how they d*ed, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck. And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone. Okay, fine. Hurry back. Oh. I would like a break. Great. I think so. I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders. Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight? It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, "Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam." So, maybe that'll stop now. Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut. Okay. Yeah. I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to. If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong. Oh, I just get those at any party supply place. Oh yeah, your mom would love that. Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable. It's... it's one of those two. [points at both] Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl? Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no. All right. [continued clapping and cheering for Michael] Oh, God. Yeah. I hear there's an important meeting here. Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. [sings] Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light. Hey. You're kidding me, right? Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding. Yeah. It's okay. OK. Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police. [sings] ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu. We have fun. Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio. I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy. I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you? Hey Pam. ...[captures bat in bag] ... You're welcome. Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home. Maybe, I'm a little tired. Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come. Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things. It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this. Hey. You made it. Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis. Yeah. How about some Splenda? Where? Yeah, close one. Nice job. Oh yeah? The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party. I want us to make it. I want a fresh start. Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us. Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim. He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed. Just listen. Don't yell! This is over. Don't break up you guys, you're great together. No, I paid them off. All of it. Sounds good. Roy don't! [Dwight pepper-sprays Roy] Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases. I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself. I don't know. This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior. It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial. I'm sorry too. I just, I think that we both made some bad choices. Um... no. No, he has a girlfriend. No, there were a lot of reasons.
