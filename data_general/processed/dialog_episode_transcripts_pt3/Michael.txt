Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So... Actually, you called me in here, but yeah. All right. Well, let me show you how it's done. [on the phone] Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. [quick cut scene] All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. [hangs up] That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... [Clears throat] So that's the way it's done. Well. I don't know. What? Uh, yeah. Just a fax. You haven't told me. It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face. My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this. Whassup! I still love that after seven years. Whassup! Whassup. Nothing. All right. Take care. [on her cell phone] Just before lunch. That would be great. Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda? What? I'm sorry? Well, I faxed one over to you this morning. Uh, yeah, the one... You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet. Do you want to look at mine? OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch. Michael, don't panic. No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided. I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other. This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing. Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a b*tch. It is a real b*tch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing? Hey, you big queen. Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today? I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes? So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily. Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous. Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer. This is Mr. Scott. Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today. Yup. You just still have these messages from yesterday. What? Don't we all? Nothing. If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. [Sighs] I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. [Imitating a PA] Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP. People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable. I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first. OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear? Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em? OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted. Go ahead. Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here? It could be out of your hands Michael. On his mother's grave. What? It's just that we need to know. Are you sure about that? You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you? Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs] What's up? Nice to meet you. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand. Damn it! Jim! It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules. That is my stapler. It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not? Yeah. OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan. You should've put him in custardy. OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all. Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head] Yeah. All right. You got a fax. What? Why? Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen? Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents? Are you serious? I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're f*ring me. But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry. You're a jerk. I don't know about that. Oh, I'm all set, thanks. Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea. Who doesn't love that? All right. It was fine. Martinez. Great. We're all set. Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance. Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind. That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance. No. With more ignorance. Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity. Right. OK. Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that... Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission? Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated. A few of the ground rules? I figured it would save time. Mr. Brown. Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK. So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome. Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment. Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening. OK. Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more r*cist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess. Wait a second. Stop it! Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge. I can't leave until you do. Michael, can I talk to you candidly? We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made. Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature. Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need. Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed. Don't worry about dating. OK. Thank you. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you. "I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart." I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, "Mr. Brown," he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears. Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing] I'm sorry. No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape. [on the tape] Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If you're a r*cist, I will att*ck you with the North." And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace. Uh, is that it? It was kind of hard to hear. I have a customer meeting. What part Native American? Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense. OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico. And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States. My parents were Mexican. Thank... Yeah... Mexican isn't offensive. Like what? What connotations, Michael? You meant something. I'm just curious. Hello? Hello? I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done. Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's... Great. Thank you. Who am I supposed to be? Outback steakhouse. [Australian accent] I'm Australian, mate! Oh, man, am I a woman? Stop... OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK. I just had the longest meeting. Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my... [slap!] [on the phone] Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you. [Itialian accent]Maybe some spagh-etti. It's collard greens. It's collard greens. I'm not making any copies. Nothing new. There's nothing new. Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera] So, which health plan have you decided on? Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael? The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan. Michael. You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan. It's your job. So... Michael... maybe... I mean... Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time. [laughs]... your problem. Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah. Gosh. That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales. OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I f*re? OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine. [to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his. OK, I take it back, it's a workspace. Thank you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Where are you? Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the... No you're not. OK. Michael, can I talk to you? Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo? Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it. Michael, he made huge cuts. Yeah, you said... I can handle that. Nothing, Kevin. Workspace. Where are you going? Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn't find the knob. I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe? Thank you. You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride. It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly. It's an industrial coal elevator. Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something? Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone] Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the... Oh, thanks. This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day. Michael. Michael? Well? Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job. I most certainly did not. What about the surprise? We all think you don't have a surprise. All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr! When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles. [clapping hands] God, yeah... Ah! This... Michael!? I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing? I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager? Yeah, so I don't have to worry? Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay? Bottom line. Do I need to be worried? Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe. I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt? Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person? Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up. Oh. Okay, umm... that would be Meredith. But it's not until next month. You still want to have a party? Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up! This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her. These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook! Meredith's allergic to dairy, so... It is... her birthday. All right. Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong. [staring at birthday card] Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor. Uh, I'm sorry to bother you. My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if... Donate to the charity? Thank you. That's... that's... that's very generous. That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great. Hey, you wanted to see me? I don't think she'd be missed. Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies. She had a hysterectomy. That's where they remove the uterus. It could be kind of funny. Michael? Are you done yet? No, it's ah... [tunelessly] Happy birthday to you. [singing] ... birthday, dear Meredith Happy birthday to you... Last year, five years ago... Yes. Uh, I can't. Um... I can't eat dairy. Yeah, it makes me sick. [box falls over] Oh. Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks? Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give. Is Oscar around? Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is. It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, "However many dollars per mile." I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity. Yeah. Last year, he walked 18 miles. Happy Birthday. [gives Meredith her card] "Happy Bird-day" Um... "Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still." That was Stanley. "Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam." This is from Michael. "Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age." No, I... I get it. It's funny. You're right. You're right. Yes. How old is she? How old is she? "She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her." Uh, nice party Michael. Oh, boy... You... Per mile. Per mile, yes. When I retire, I... don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back. A check for the kids, and for the team. Thank you, Michael. [to Jim] Hey, you ready? Michael! Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, "This might be kinda fun." And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together. Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team. Oh, please. I apologized for that. Michael, I... I can handle that. And that's why you have an assistant regional manager. [to camera] Same thing. My fiance has plans for us this Saturday. So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding. Fine, don't worry about that. What's up? It's not my real name. Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers. Yeah, yeah. Pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago. We're loading at one. 15. So, that's the busy time. All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock. All right, see you at one. [half-heartedly] Yeah. Gimli. Just trying to be helpful. That's him. I'm sorry? Why "of course"? What's that supposed to mean? Uh, I heard it. I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school. But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch? OK. I can help out, if you need me. I have a hoop in my driveway. I have a sports bra. Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can] Missed it... Yes! Can I be team captain? Can I be team manager? Assistant team manager? OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then. Oh my God. thr*at neutralized. Please don't throw garbage at me. I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and... Maybe Angela would cheerlead. I'll do it. Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good. Just getting a tea bag. Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's. No, that's not as much fun. You know what? You're on. OK. Cool, you're on. [to Dwight] Don't screw this up. I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah. Yeah, you too. Should be fun. I stretched before I came. OK. Really? I thought I'd take Roy. [taking off his shirt] OK, we'll be skins! What? Shirts on or off? You sure? Don't listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car. That's what I'm talking about. [Roy scores] Well done team. Woo! [misses a half court sh*t] Aw, come on! What is wrong with me today!? Usually h*t those. [Dwight scores] Dwight, I was open. All right, let's go. OK. OK, I'll take it. [misses free throw] OK. When I am playing hoops all of the stress and responsibility of my job here just melts away. It's gone, I'm in the zone. [misses another sh*t] What is wrong with me today?! Who am I? Am I Michael Scott? I don't know... I might just be a basketball machine. What's Dunder Mifflin? I've never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um... well, that's probably gonna happen, actually. [dancing] Where you at? Where you at? You over there? I'm over there. That is cool. Is that like the Robot? Hey! Come on man! Yeah, like that counts. You know what? Dwight, Dwight... Football is like rock and roll, it's just bam-bam-boo... And basketball is like jazz, you know? You're kind of... Dupee-doo, dupee-do. It's all downbeat, it's in the pocket, it's like... [singing] Dupee-do, dupee-do, dapee-dah... [steals the ball, scores, mimics singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball. All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on! You know what? Let me take Roy. All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on. He's afraid of you now. [Jim makes a sh*t after pushing off Roy] Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt? No, you take it easy. [Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight. [scores] Yes! You're ahead. Yeah, baby, here we go! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You all right? Sorry, I didn't mean to do that. Take your sh*t man! No it wasn't. Oh, really? No, I just put my arm up... Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes] Wait, what does that mean? What is it, a tie? What's going on? That was you. Yeah, this isn't happening. So what's that? We're coming in on Monday, right? Monday? Yeah? Let's get you into a tub. What time do we have to come in? Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend. Are you listening to me Michael? What did I just say? Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales. I'm not going to do that Michael. We've created an incentive program to increase sales. At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars. Uh, yes. Yes you can. No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize. I didn't mean me! Sex. t*rture. Uh, Michael? Hey, there's a... There's a person here... There's... There's a person here who wants to sell handbags. Okay, I told her you'd talk to her. Okay. This one is hand embroidered. Cocks in the henhouse. Katy. Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.[Pam looks embarassed at Michael - Katy looks sympathetically at Pam] So am I. Doesn't matter. 30. Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman. I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating. This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. [knocks on wall] used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.[Katy unpacks her handbags] I guess a cup of coffee would be great. What? Regular coffee is fine. No really it is. Bring it on. The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies. Thank you. Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um... I'm installing File Share on all the computers. Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right? I'm on the phone. That was on Sesame Street. No, I don't believe that. It's nice having Katy around. It's another person for Michael to um, interact with. Hi, nice to meet you. Eighty-nine. Yeah. A girl. I should probably get back to my table. Okay. Alright. Cool. See ya in a bit. [looks at picture on Toby's desk] Oh, she's cute. Cutie-pie. Back to work. I wished, right? Good. [whispers] Sorry. [to Pam] Come back... Is that from Starbucks? Wow. Is that for the office? I wouldn't think of it. Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper! Oh, nothing. My ride just bailed on me. Oh no, it's um... No... No. I really don't want to inconvenience you. At five? Okay. Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay. Okay. Cool. Cool. Great. Cool. Cool. [takes deep breath - looks at camera] Yeah, okay. It's actually better this way. Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because... Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much. What? Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab? Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home? You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me? Do you love her? Hmmm... Oh, thank you. Is that from the machine that was in your office? I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson. Very easy to clean.[Stanley walks out] Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right? [laughs] Yeah, I gave it to you. So, can I..? [points to the door] Gray. Dark Gray. Charcoal. Yeah. I would love to. Alright. You don't want to recycle them? Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water] What about this bottle of power drink? Blue. Blue Blast. Okay. No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept. Well, it's empty. Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat? Alright. I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. [laughs] I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right? I don't know. Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you. Goodnight, Michael. I don't know. Grab a drink, I think? I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook. I got this. [taking Katy's bag from Michael] I got it. Don't drink and drive. Have a good night. You're not going to freak out? You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you. What? [in Fat Albert voice] Fat Halpert. [in normal voice] Jim Halpert. Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky. Mine are at home in a display case above my bed. Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends. T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say "Don't go there" but that's... lame. I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out. I think I did. Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time. We ran out last year, remember? Yes we should. I... you know what? I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, [turns to Kevin] someone had eaten all of them. [in video] That's supposed to be confidential. [in video] He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. h*t it, Dwight![Dwight starts playing the tune of "Mambo No. 5" by Lou Bega on his recorder] [singing along to tune on video] A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...[Somebody sits in front of the camera on the video, so even though nothing can be seen, Michael can still be heard] Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great. Okay, now I'm laughing at you. [on speaker phone] It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael. No. No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this. Um...[Michael looks at the camera and motions for the camera to leave the office] Are you there Michael? Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.[Michael closes the blinds][The camera tries to find a cr*ck in the blinds] Um, what, ah, what is, I mean...[The camera pans around to reception, Pam is listening] ...come on, Jan![The camera goes to a side of Michael's office where the blinds are still partially open] Really? I'm dropping an atomic b*mb on you? You already had a party on May 5th for no reason. And you had a luau.... And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money. Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense. Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage. I am not. [in video] The Dundie award for "Longest Engagement" goes to Pam Beesley. Pam, everybody! [starts clapping][Pam just sits there stirring her drink, rolls her eyes and glances over at Jim][Jim, at the adjacent table, crosses his arms and glances over at Pam, both look annoyed] [on video] Yes. [on video] Ah, w-we'll see you next year. [on video] Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God! No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, "world's longest engagement", um, we're all expecting it, you know? Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy. Michael... ...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom. Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions... ...for people's behavior. And it's- Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!! [with a small fist pump] Yes! Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. [points] Devon! The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like. The waitress tripped on the cord. [to waitress] Oh, just put these on the group tab. You said, we could bring our families. I did, my wife's name is Terri. It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.[Michael is dumbfounded, Dwight pushes a button on his keyboard that says, "OHHH, YEAHHHH."] Really? We don't have any girls from HR. Yeah? Yeah! Like an A*DS test? No! [under his breath] God. Um... Yeah, gotta eat somewhere. And now... to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts... ...the "Busiest Beaver" award goes to Phyllis Lapin.[Everybody starts clapping, Phyllis gets out of her booth and makes her way to Michael, she gives Jim a high five along the way] This says "Bushiest Beaver". It's, it's fine. If you would have asked me that, then you would know.[Michael has false teeth in and glasses with squinted eyes on them] Yeah. [doing impression] Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny.[The camera zooms to an Asian customer behind Michael, she is looking at Michael in disbelief] [to an off camera waiter and still clutching Jim's beer] Can I get a drink? This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.[Cut to Pam still drinking the beer] Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The "Hottest in the Office" award goes to... ...Ryan the temp! What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now. Second drink? "Spicy Curry", what's that mean? Yeah, but why'd you give it to me? This is a bowler- Yeah, but everyone else- Just sit down Kelly. [sweaty and chugging water from a bottle] It's so freakin' hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do. [Music starts playing in the background] Here we go, he's early with the cue. Here we go. Sing it Elton. We just came from yo' mama's house. Sing 'em a song dude. Uh, you know what guys, we're just having a little office party, so if you want, uh... You suck man! Let's cut it. [Dwight turns the music off] [clears throat] [with a lot less enthusiasm] I had a few more Dundies to, uh, give out tonight, but, I'm just going to cut it short. And wrap it up so everybody can enjoy their food. Um...thanks for listening, those who listened. [clears throat] This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the "Don't Go in There After Me" award. It's for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So... Dundies! Dundies! Fine work! Fine work Stanley! So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin. [starts chuckling] And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...[Cut to Pam, her face goes from drunken elation to sober realization] ...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.[Cut to Jim's reaction of scared expectation] It is the "Whitest Sneakers" award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on! And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!! [struggling] Ahh! I can't- We have a strict policy here not to over serve. Apparently, this young woman was sneaking drinks off other people's tables. I Xeroxed her driver's license and she is not welcome to this restaurant chain ever again. Watch your step. Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion. Hey. Um... I don't think so. Oh! There it is! Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.' Well done. Topical. So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background] Do you want the link because then you could forward it around? Consider it? What has two thumbs and likes to bone your Mom? [points at self] This guy! [makes laser g*n noises] bleep, bleep. What's up, Halpert? Still q*eer? Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o! Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So... Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don't know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here's the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent. We're talking blonde incompetent. Like 10 words a minute... talking. They are women, right? I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a b*tch. Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation? [to Ryan] Come on, kid. Let's go. Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist? Yes! Michael? Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds. Um... literally two seconds? The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy. It's really not a big deal, Michael. And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer... Just to refresh you... . on our policy. Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones. There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke. Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later. I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it. A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says "Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?" This is what's at stake. Like a joke? A knock-knock joke? Oh! Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with. Hey, hey, hey. So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad. [fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad. You look like you feel bad. Little package! Little package! Little package! Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back. Uh, yes! I can go over it with you. It's over. Email forwards. I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck. All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand? Yeah, Meredith. Yes. She wasn't that hot. I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it. No. Well, that would be... Okay, I'm lost. Rules for the Modern Workplace] No, thanks. I'm good. Uh... my mother's coming. Yes! [to video screen] Right here. You are a naughty girl! [to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi. Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably. I love lawyer jokes. Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em. You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem? Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything. Do you need to see the video again, Michael? [to Jan] He talked the whole time. No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll] Does that include 'That's What She Said'? Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so... Michael. MICHAEL! There he is. There he is. Good one. Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really. That's not my sense of humor. Wha... [to camera] And motorcycle head injuries, worker's comp, and diet pill lawsuits. [to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer. Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself. So I'm not in trouble? I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems. Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here. Phyllis? Ex-squeeze me? Packer said it. I'm the same age as you, Michael. We're in the same High School class. You mean where my desk is? Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway. Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they? Michael! Come on! You don't have to worry. I'm not going to... ...report you to HR. You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody. I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit. What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for? I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts. Ok. [Removes biscuit, leaving only sausage, egg and cheese.] Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs. Diversifying. Smart. And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers. You should go. Uh huh. You have your lawyer there? Can I be your representative? I think I should be there. I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code. Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work. So you're taking a personal day? Please, I'll make you proud. Yes! As your representative? Same thing. I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a b*llet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy. You headed out? Ok. Have a great time. Yeah, I changed them to your new address. Yup. Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription. [shakes head] Yeah. What kind of shocks you got on this baby? [tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down. But then no one can see us. Check it out. [points at sunglasses] Terminator. You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball. Which one's yours? Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association. Nice to meet you. This is smaller than your old place. It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood. Fair enough. Oh. Terrible idea. No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed. Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off. Shh Shh. What kind of mortgage did you get? Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total. Ho, thirty years. Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies. Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live. Whenever you're ready. Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants. We'll be here waiting for you. Whenever you're ready, Michael. Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk. What? Michael, this is the unit you saw and... Who told you that? As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here. Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom. That's some extra income for you. You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now. Ehhhh.... Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow. You didn't have to... No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent. I don't even know what to say. Question. Where can I put my terrarium? It's a fish t*nk for snakes and lizards. Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas? Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine? Just for fun? Question. Who is the primary on the f*re insurance? You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm. We paid it off early. People love beets. Everybody loves beets. Let's get this roof going. Michael. Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo. Nice. Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you. Really? These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one. [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps] And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal. Silver medal. Um... 'Cause your condo's in America. Okay. The temp agency wants to know what you think. Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years. Ah, well, I'm interested in business. Uh, no, actually, uh, what I want is to own my own company. That is ridiculous. Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one. Fozzie bear? Mmm... No. That was Yoda. Got it. And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch. Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW! Yes, I was the first one out. And, yes, I've heard women and children first. But, we do not employ children. We are not a sweat shop. Thankfully. And, uh, women are equal in the workplace by law. So, I let them out first, I have a lawsuit on my hands. Yeah. Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he? Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act. Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off. Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today. Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers. did my shoes come off in the plane crash? Is this your car, Ryan? Good shocks. That's actually a test prep book. That's a test prep for business school. I just got in. I applied, I go at night. Yeah. No, not yet. Just started. I... wouldn't even know where to start. Do it. All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years? Uh... Keep an existing... It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer. Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks. Self taught. You didn't even go to college. [scoffs] Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh? I am. Stupid! I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all. It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base. The Crow. Maybe we should get some air. Come on people, you know the rules of the game now. Okay. It's called Who Would You Do? Hey, Angela! Roy. Nice to meet you. Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling. You're all gay. [answers phone] Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk... this is great timing. Would that make you happy? If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy? I'm on it. You can't go in yet! What if he dies in the f*re? And that's the last thing you ever said to him. Ooh, Toby! [on the phone] Hey, where are you? Oh good. Yeah. We're just here, we're playing Desert Island. It's when you pick your five favorite DVDs... What's your number? Um... You got to... you got to give it to me again. Now I have it. [coughing] [coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing. That's exactly what I said. Were you absent? I am so sorry. I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the f*re"] Ryan started the f*re! It was always burning since the world's been turning!Dwight and Everybody! I can't believe I started the f*re.Dwight and [singing] ... Marilyn Monroe!Dwight and [sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the f*re! Okay. Rule five - safety first, i.e. don't burn the building down. Okay? That should be a no brainer. Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart. Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called. Ohh... OK. [on phone] Jan Levinson's office. Oh, she's in a meeting. Uh, she just wanted the name of the employee you let go. I just need the name of who you're planning to let go. I know she wanted the name. Yeah? Jan wants the name as soon as possible, Michael. Mm-Hmm. Hey, I'm still here. Yeah. OK. Hanging up now. [entering] You wanted me? [notices Michael's costume] Papier-mache? Hmm. Mm-hmm. Why did you put it off until Halloween? I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little. So it's a man? I just answer the phone. You're costume is fantastic! [laughs] Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't. [Michael laughs] Aah! [laughs, then leaves] Okay... Ass. Michael. Yeah. Yes. What are you implying? You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night. Yeah. But we don't keep two sets of books. Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it. Why is that? Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer? Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything. Yeah. Oh. Jim. Definitely. Phyllis. Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela. One of the warehouse guys. Who is he saying? No, Michael. No, not me. Not Dwight. I know that's what he said. Tell him, not Dwight. Tell him to stop. Quiet, you. [laughs, and imitates Donald Tr*mp] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone. If you want to f*re him, you're going to have to tell him yourself. This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment? I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills. And I turned it down. Out of loyalty to this company... ... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially. But then you wouldn't have me here. It's in Maryland. I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway. Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna f*re. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma. Michael, I really didn't mean to... I'm sorry? Oh, you want me to be you? Okay. Oh, are you f*ring Creed? We should switch seats in order to... Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal... Wow. That's an overreaction. Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you... Okay. Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought. [picks up the phone] Michael Scott here. Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth... Yeah, I know. Huh? Could I talk to you for a second? What are you telling me? No, I don't. I wanna stay right here. No, I wanna stay here. Um, I think there's a misunderstanding, Michael. Can I go? Let's fight it. Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days. Did you start the paperwork yet? You don't have to do this, Michael. Undo it! No, you have the power to undo it. Michael, undo it! Don't... Yeah, I went hunting once. sh*t the deer in the leg, had to k*ll it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask? Fine. f*re someone else. f*re Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon. No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man. Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good. Creed's an idiot, you know that. No, no, no, no, no, no! You had it right the first time. Exactly. You gotta go with your gut, man. That's why I'm being fired? So you might not look like an idiot? This is unbelievable! I just hope that you and I can remain friends. What! That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food. [ringing the doorbell of Michael's Condo] Trick or treat! I'm a bumble bee. A fairy princess. I'm a lion. Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm. Did you ask me here for any specific reason? Why is that secret? [Pam knocks and walks into Michael's office] Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign. It's just last year you... Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier. Well, is that really a priority? Catch-22. Hello? Do you mean Neverland? What? [looks to see who is calling but doesn't pick up] Hello? Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them. Ok. Michael? Could you b*at up Michael? Because we're friends. Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so... Uh, how did you know they were black belts? You don't need to write 'ex'. Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right? Have you signed the expense reports yet? Argggg! I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can b*at them up. I can't. I just got a manicure. Just have Dwight punch you. What belt are they? No! Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight. Ok, I'll punch you. Kiyah! Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright? [to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and s*ab me with it. I just have a quick question. No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car? He's a purple belt. That's really high. It's just out there, you... Yeah. Uh, Kitchen. What? I didn't sucker punch you, Michael. In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai. Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best sh*t. Two punches. Go! No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective. Yeah. Ooh, what about, uh, Dwight's dojo? No, it's free during the day. It's fine. Michael... Any word on those time cards? Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight... Uh, no, it's not. Actually, it's a symbol for eternal discipline. Yes, Sensei! Hiii! [kicks Michael] Alright, break. Dwight - awarded a point. Eat it! Two more. Sweep the leg. No. No points for pants. Clean single kick, gentlemen. No holding. No, stop it! Come on! Michael. No, Michael! Seven new messages. First New Message. [Michael's voice] "Hi, Ryan. This is S*ddam Hussein." Next new message. "Hi, Ryan. This is your girlfriend... and I'm mad!" Fudge? just put 9-1-1. [Dwight leaves] Yeah, you too. I have the emergency contacts. Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably. Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday. Alright, bye. Michael, did you finish yet? I'm busy. We want to go home. The shipping place closes in a half hour. I don't care. Of course. Michael, I don't know... I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office. I'll have Pam send out a memo. Just a formality. Michael, I have so much to learn from you. Thank you, Sensei. And, ditto. This is a projection of the county's needs... So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um- Excuse me? You had no right to do that, Michael. It said that. Alright. But you will let me run this meeting. I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting. Thank you. Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour. Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour? So which way is Chili's? Oh, no, that's alright. I wanna leave straight from there. I know Scranton. Alright. If it's a couple blocks away- Ok. Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead. Why would we need a signal? What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael? You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that. Yeees. Yes. Just Jan Levinson. No, not long. Michael. Michael, we got divorced, ok? [to Christian] I'm so sorry. Excuse me. Michael. [to hostess] Uh, could we have a table for three, please? We're in a meeting. Christian. Thank you. Right. Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years. So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction- What? Sure. So- If you have a- It's ok, I like jokes. Just the one. Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. [to Michael on speakerphone] Ok, you want me to read 'em? Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him- When- Ok. There's a transcript between a naval ship- Oh, those are drawings. In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head. And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn. Now we know what he looks like. The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn? What's the bottom line? Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop. That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words. That's her fault. I have time. [singing] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back- So after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise, that I made to her, and take care of her. Oh no, Michael, Michael, please. No, really. It's not fair. We'd been fighting for a while- No. That's right. You were really brave! You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists. Right down the street? I know. It's terrible. I don't know. I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me half way, ok, because they're expecting me to make cuts. Yeah. [Pam puts her hand out for an earbud] Definitely. Bye... thanks. [pumps fist] Yes! We got it! I am really- [Michael kisses Jan] Thrilled. [Michael and Jan kiss again] Let's go. Let's go. [waking up on office couch] Michael? Michael? [goes into Michael's office] Michael? [looks out Michael's window] His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who's this? Jan? Morning, Pam. Hey. No, nothing happened. I-I swear, nothing happened. What, I'm, totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I. [laughs] No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all. It's off limits. Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm. So. Did you do her? Jan Levinson-Gould. Did you do her? And she is your boss. Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. Wow. Um, ok. [pops Dwight's orb with scissors] It's performance review day, company-wide. Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds. So, I don't really know what to expect. Thank you. Oh, no. Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon. My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been [makes slashing neck hand motion] swack, divorced. Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue. Was not professional. Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is. But this was mutual. She missed you. I have one idea of what it means. Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this. Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you. Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward. Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words. Oh, yes. Let's listen to it again. And this time, really listen to the pauses. Oh, no, that's ok. I did learn it on the streets. On the ghetto, in fact. Oh, yea! Michael? Jan's on the phone for you. Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year. Michael. I am returning your many calls. No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael. The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch. Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael. I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior. Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior. Michael. Are the cameras with you... ...in your office? Romances? Sorry. What suggestion box? Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started. Don't you mean constructive criticism? You said "constructive complements"; that doesn't make any sense. Sure. I'm good; how are you? Nice to see you. Can we please go in your office? Oooo. Thank you. Nice to see you too, Michael. Not like that. You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top. I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business. Period. Do we understand each other. Absolutely. So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then? No. Fine. How is that a business question? No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking? Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting. You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here. Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting [to Pam] is it happening right now? Great. Very good. I thought you read these every week. It happens occasionally. That sounds serious, Michael. Tom? Tom? He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. [blank stares] Tom? [acts like she's sh**ting herself in the head] Pow. Next suggestion. You need to do something about your B.O. Aren't the suggestions meant for you? Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying. You were inferring. You need- To do something about- Sometimes you talk to us real close. Well, when you have coffee breath- It's hard. Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday? Next suggestion. I can't, I can't- Please sit down. You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there. Please, sit yourself down. What, Michael. [loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise! I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah! Yes! Why are you gonna give me this raise? Why? Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome! Michael? Great. I am ready for my performance review. Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael? Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise? dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late. Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia. I even come in on holidays. That's a serious offense! I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace. For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office. You liked it! It's a delicacy. And you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise. I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes. And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said "Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of". I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow. 'K? Michael, now is not the time or the place. No, I am saying we are never having this conversation. Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.' Michael, it has nothing- With your looks, ok? It's your personality. I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate. Really. You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok? And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that- At this time in my life. I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok? Ohhh, God. Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now. And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am. And that is all I needed; I'm good. I can go home now. Ummm... no idea. Are we in danger? Michael, should I call the... [Michael waves his hands] What? The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start. That just means you have to enter your password. What's your password, Michael? Oh, it's 1-2-3. Mi- Sorry. Ok, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing? You have to tell me. Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over. Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm- Or get h*t by a car- Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke. Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok? Why don't you just go... away? There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed, it--- And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails. By keyword phrase. Hey, what's the deal, Michael? Why are you spying on our computers? Actually, it's just- Ok... Tin Man. Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance. So it's true? You have access to our e-mails? I think I do. I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory. Oh. [to Michael] Are you gonna eat with us? Uh hum. The professors would go to the parties? Oh, ok, cool. Hey. Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock. Oh, um... .I can't. Uh hmm, definitely. You do? Because you said "do you wanna hang out"- Really? Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun. Improv sounds great. Alright. I think Stanley just coughed. No thanks. I'm on a call. My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien- Oh. I'm just leaving for the day. Charity. Bake drive. No! No, I'm not. Battlestar Galatica. I can't- Tonight. Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice. Soccer practice. Clarinet. Ok, let's get right into it. I need two people for the first scene. Great. [skips] La la la la la laaa... [fake kicks in door] Boom! Detective Michael Scarn. I'm with the FBI. I'm supposed to meet my doctor here? Have ya seen him? He's a very angry midget. Again!? Stop, stop, ok, stop. You sh*t me, great. Now stop. You can't just sh**t everyone in the scene. Ok, what about the scene they set up? No, it wasn't. No more g*n. No. No. Michael, I want you to give me all the g*n you have. Just, I want you to get rid of all your g*n and give them to me. Great. Freeze! You wanna go over the rules one more time? I promise it's worthit . Ooo, I can see you walking out of here and you're thrilled with your reading. Michael, what did you tell him? Ok, let's call it a day. Nice job, Bill. Oh, don't worry. We're all gonna carpool. Oh sorry, we're not going as a group, it's just a private friend who just happens to know all of us from different ways is throwing a private birthday thing. Ok. Dwight... Wow! Who opened the morgue for this thing? I'm just driving by, thought I'd drop in. [to Jim] There's some wine. I would love a glass, if you're gonna open it. Here ya go Temp, take my jacket! [sees Sadiq (IT guy)] Oh, come on! That guy? He is a good guy, not a t*rror1st. Karaoke, I love it! I am a karaoke fiend. I call dibs. I got next, I got next up. Come on, let's get this party started, ha! Ok? Where's that wine? [singing] It requires a dedication, all this love we feel needs no conversation. Divided, together, uh huh. Making love with each other, uh huh. [singing] Islands in the stream, that is what we are, no one in between, how can we be wrong? Sail away with me... I am- Shut up! Go. Get the door. Go. Push! Push! Really shove it. Shove it through! Break it! You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight. I got a splinter. I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up. One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.] Merry Christmas! [holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big? But what are we going to do with this hacked off part? Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive. Fifty. Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me. It was a tough year. I had to f*re somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of f*ring Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that. You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party. [having trouble with a plastic tablecloth as Pam stands idly by] Will you help me? Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours. Yeah. Yeah, I've seen Santa. Who cares? Michael, I would like to be the elf. I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't [smiles happily]. I think I did a pretty good job. Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret. Yeah? Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ? That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can .. I want to do it. Three, two, one. [very dim lights come on the tree] Hey, I could get some flares from my car. No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa. All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present] [unwraps present] Whoa, a video iPod. Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks. Yeah, you left the price tag on. Yeah. Michael. I knitted it for you. An oven mitt? Okay. [walks out] We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions. What is Yankee Swap? Yeah, we call it White Elephant. Why are we doing this? It sounds mean. Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. [starts to cry] Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam. Yeah, I figured. I will steal the iPod. Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge h*t. It is almost a Christmas miracle. It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else. I'll take the oven mitt. Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology. Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm. You and me, Michael. Yes! [sh**ting paintball g*n at target] Take that, S*ddam! Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas. Maybe because you hated her present so much. And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else. How much? All right, I'm done now. It comes to $166.41. Fifteen bottles of vodka? Yeah, that should do it. I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something. What is that? We're really not supposed to serve alcohol. Me. Please. Are you kidding? You wait. There should be some .. One, two, three. [do a sh*t] Oh, no. I really did not do anything. This is so awesome. Thank you. [grabbing Michael around the neck] Merry Christmas, asswipe! [rapping] What's up my nerds. Check it out. [points at the mistletoe stuck down his pants] Pacman need a drinky. [listening to music through headphones] Yeahhh. That's okay, Mike. All right. Thanks, man. Oh, how did I not guess that? Michael? Poor Richard's? Yeah, that sounds good. Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time. Yep. Yeah. [putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five... Where are we going this afternoon? And brush our teeth. Michael. I need to know... What we're doing. You said bring a toothbrush. Is this an overnight? Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow? Not maybe. Yes or no. In January? It's cheaper. This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience. I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that? I'm already in business school. Wait, Michael? Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit? Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit. I took the tags off already. Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, "Who is this smart little cookie?" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say. I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course. Last year, Michael's theme was "Bowl over the Competition!" So guess where we went. How about the sales department is the sails? What does the furnace do? I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right? I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October. Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned. What? Aye aye, Captain. [singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour. Actually, I'm the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan. I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship. [to boarding passengers] Hi, welcome aboard. Okay. In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose. Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack. Okay! So... Please. The life preservers. They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat. Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. [Dwight laughs loudly.] Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here... Okay, Michael, if you don't mind... Please, okay? Michael. Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay? Why don't you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right? I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10! Yeah. Everybody's really nice. When are you going to start the presentation? Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo! All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest! Nope! Dance contest! All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! h*t it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate! So, what's this presentation all about? Women and children. That's a stupid analogy. Wow. You should be the motivational speaker. Um... let's see, uh... The customer. Because the customer is king. Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam! No, it was Captain Jack. We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship! No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there. Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon. Really? What? Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here? It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about. I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet. What happened to you? Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking? What a night. She was always engaged. That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so... Yeah, I know. Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway. She's engaged. Huh. Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Michael, what's wrong? Ok, wait wait wait wait... Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?! Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt. What is going on? I want to come to work. But I need you to come and pick me up. [Jim lunges across Pam's desk and puts Michael on speakerphone] Hey, whoa, Michael... It's, okay, it's Jim. Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened. You b*rnedyourfoot on a Foreman Grill? I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that. Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone. Michael, you should stay home and rest. Can you hop? I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance. Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him. I'm gonna save you! Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there! Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend? But you said that you went out with her this weekend. He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper! Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight! You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate. No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot. b*rned my foot, Pam. So, where are you shipping your foot? Your foot? You didn't have any. And do my job? [holding mini-fan] It slipped. It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment. Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy. Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to. What? No, I didn't. What is wrong withyou? Here you go. Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat. They were out of yams. I got you creamed spinach. Yes. They had no yams. Pan? [phone rings] What. Tell me before I come there. No. No. Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God! Dwight's kind of my friend! You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it. What, what happened? What do you need? I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room. Ryan, is, uh, dead. Dead. No. Can't, can't you just get up yourself? I... You only grilled your foot. Wow... Um, I had scoliosis as a girl. When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung. I'm not disabled and neither are you. Mailboxes, Etc. Oh, we wouldn't. We love Stevie Wonder. [looking up at Creed] Dad? Twice. I think that's from Big. Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia. Uh hmmmm... . I mean I'm learning nothing. Michael Scott, I'm looking for Michael Scott. Great. Thank you. Actually, I've been meaning to come by here for a long time... No, I just have a lot of properties to manage. I don't know, like 30 seconds? Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me. This morning? Just like every other morning, just climbed on in. [Everyone laughs] Hey, hey, relax, just jokin around here. Listen, I've actually used a chair since I was four years old. I don't really notice it anymore. So, there are just a couple things I want to remind everybody of... Dwight, you have your hand up. You know what Michael? Let me stop you right there. And leave. No, not Michael. The moon-faced kid who crashed into the pole. He looks like he has a concussion. I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale! You are very welcome. No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams! You sure? Ok. You know what? I feel better. Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot. I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding. I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine. Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion. He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact. I think that you should go with him. I want Michael to take me... You can take my van! Fine. Oh, huggy hugs. You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight? The rules of g*n are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout "g*n" when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That's how the game's played. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion. Well, I think she has a kid. We're going to Chuck E. Cheese. We're going to the hospital, Michael. I know, just sayin'. I'm thirsty! No. You can't f*re me, I don't work in this van! No. [takes a drink] [to Michael] Will you stop? [drinks] Mmmmm... Michael stop. [sprays Michael, then Dwight] My eyes! My eyes! Danger. It's Kurt. Wow, I am so sad that I know that. Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write? So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital. Hi Michael! A head injury. What is that? Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot. That's what she said. Ok, no electronics past this point. Camera, sound equipment... No metal of any kind. I don't want to do this. Oh. Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. [laughing] Oh, my God. Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here? Nothin' much what's up with you? Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant! I'm on the phone. What's that? Huh? What does that mean? The thing you just said? Just forget it. What's up-dog? [mouthing] So close. [low] Damn it. Empty mind. Michael. Oscar is out sick. Can I do some of the talking? Hello. Hello? And Dwight. Yeah I think I came down with the flu. Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D. I have the chills. Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed. Ok. First impressions? Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick. Question? May I investigate? You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry. Hey Michael. Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great. Umm, hmm. Nobody. Wow! Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship. And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can. Alright. Great. Thank you. [low] Oh God, here. I'm going with grape. Which one? I don't know what you mean. Uh, uh, ok. What is? I'm going to take off actually. Hmm? There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth. The liar will perspire. Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful. Tony the tiger. You don't hear that much any more. Ok, what is going on here? You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim. Is that true? Thank you Michael. I know your telling the truth. I can tell. I won't let you down. Thanks. I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room. No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here. Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea. Let's go out. I know just he place. [at Hooters] Oh man, you should order milk. Get it? Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings. Hey I'm Dana. Welcome to Hooters. Nope we're not brothers. And for you? Oh, it's great. It's served with our world famous wing sauce. Is that what you really want? Nuh-uh. Uh, I really don't want to talk about it. Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor. Uh-huh. What about you? Here you go. And I understand we have a birthday today. Thank you. Thanks, thanks Dana. Thank you very much. Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office. Including prep time? If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here. And I'd forget too. Michael is that a wig? This is from Hooters. Did Toby approve this? You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again? Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right? I'm not processing this. He seems fine to me. Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding? Hey. Umm, what happened? Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal. Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good? Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay? Oh, no, that's, you don't have to. No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so. Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise? Yep. Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week. I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me. Um, Pam plus Spam plus...? Right. It was great. Mm-hm. Roy and I just got back from the Poconos. I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January. What? I don't know. [looking at pile on Michel's carpet] Oh... I don't know. No, I don't think it's a bird. What's goin' on? [taking a look] I don't think that's vomit. Me? Oh, that's ridiculous. Michael. [tapping on door] [after going in to check out the smell] Phew. Oh! No, mm-mm. [leaving quickly] That's no burst pipe. Hi guys. Somebody makin' soup? [coughing] It's still stinky. She probably scrubbed itintothe fibers of the carpet. Total permeation. [giggles at Roy] That might be a little difficult with the one computer. But there's definitely a desk open in the back. ...which I guess I'll be taking. [shaking head] Weird. [putting his feet on desk] Ha ha ha... the old bullpen. Okay. Yeah! [agreeing] Mm. No way! And who had your office? [to Jim] I'm serious. My closet doors will not shut. I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big? So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that. So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit... That guy Miles who quit to form his own company? No! I thought he was out on the road. Ah. When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office [picture behind Michael falls]. Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them thattheywere crazy. [on phone] Excuse me one second, please. [to Michael] What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer? Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm. [laughs] Okay. [after Michael punches him in the arm] What did you h*t me for? What? You shouldn't have h*t me, Michael. Oh, okay. Gah. Oh, please Jim? Please, please, Jim. Please, please, please? He's so cute. I like himsomuch. And I would do it, but I'm too shy. Please, Jim, please, please, please, please, Jim. Please, please, please... [whispering] Michael. What? Old fashioned raid. Sales on Accounting. Yeah. Follow my lead. Hey, Michael. Yeah! [laughing] Should we help 'em pick up their stuff? Okay. You're gonna throw my things on the ground? What happened in Michael's office was wrong. I understand it [chuckles], it makes sense [regains composure] But it... it was still wrong. Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her. [on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I'm totally gonna win us that box set. Jethro Tull... I need to make a sales call. Please? No. We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit. Were you? It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael. Yeah! You're gonna compete against us? It is so on! Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us! [walking by with new carpet] What... What's that? Whatcha doing? [laughing] I think he's dancing. That was definitely not dancing. Paper business. Nope. Really? I thought you. [both laugh in Michael's earshot] This was no act of God. A person did this. A person who works in this office. Maybe all of them. That doesn't seem fair. But you're the one who picked today. That's not what a hate crime is. What's our punishment? [to Jim] Oh, long-term, definitely. Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay? Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything. I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows? Sure. He hired me. How's he doing? I thought you might. Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that. [sighs] I wasn't talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you? Yeah. Should we go upstairs? So, what's the problem with my pension? Well, what was done? Yeah, somebody once did that in my office. Yeah. You can't expect to be friends with everybody. No. They'll always think of you as a boss first. I'm not sure that ever happens. Why can't your workers be your workers, family be your family, your friends be your friends? Yep. Hello, yes. I'm looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott. Your mom, you gay nerd! Hey, did you get that package I left for you? It was pretty big. Yeah. Left it in the middle of your office. [laughs uproariously] Special delivery! Sit on the throne, Michael. Oh. [laughs and claps] Yeah, yeah! Oh my God. It was Packer! Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So... Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here. What are you doing? Michael. Michael. You are not allowed in this session. Now you're really not allowed in this session. I'm your boss. We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please. Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing. Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy... too... sort of. Let's do this! [in the background] Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap. Yeah! I don't know what you're doing here, Michael, ... but it's very destructive. Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael? Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse. OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works. Please? Thank you. very much. My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time. Why? I don't understand. I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it. Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today. The experience... Okay. Let's go. Step up. It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this. Mike. Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now. Look, would ya... look. Dammit, Michael! We ought to have this thing serviced. Hey, do you want me to go? I'll go. There are always a million reasons not to do something. My priority is safety. So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin. Uh uh uh. Don't shush me. That bothers me too. Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy. You know that's a good question, Hasselhoff. What bugs us? Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? We're not millionaires. You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently. Like next to no benefits. Exactly. That's what I'm talking about. Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally. In my truck. Come on, man. Union! Union, yeah. Are you with us Mike? Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before... What? A union! What... I'm not... Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women. The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here? You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out. That's too bad. I don't want to... Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael. Don't say another word. Get yourself down stairs. It's really cool. How can someone so beautiful be so sad? Did you take care of the situation? Excuse me. It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... . This is not a good idea right here. You did uh... okay. Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza. Poor people love pizza. White people love pizza. Black people love pizza. Do black people like pizza? Generalized mumbling agreement. Yeah. Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship. Hey Michael. This ain't over. Ahhh! Excellent. Yeah. Wow. And you want me to come with you. I will stay here and run things on this end. Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York? Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know... Screwed. Whatis your problem? This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love. That's OK. The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO. Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya! [opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh! [anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th. That's great. [Meredith scowls] Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to [turns and rushes back up stairs] Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there. Really? Well, I hope I do. Oh zip it. Michael Scott. [sticks out hand for handshake] You know Dan Gore from Buffalo. What's up buddy? Guilty, yeah. Not much, they're uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we're just waiting for the presentations. She ain't my boss dude. I don't work for that b*tch. What? You like Jan? How can youlikeJan? You hooked up with Jan? Yeah, let's change the subject. Nice to meet you. OK, Michael. What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.] [video dialogue for "The Faces of Scranton"] Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on. Yeah, I sh*t a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about. [video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants. Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, "Great Scott!"] Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great. But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well? Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too. [David looks at Jan, who glares at Michael.] NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired. Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together. Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand? Surely, you cannot be serious? You understand this is a very serious situation. You made a joke? Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss... Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice. Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day. Oh. They are either going to say yes... or no. Think it through. Can we not? Still want that. Fumble! Yaaah! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike! Yeah. I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone. Ha! I don't get it. Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right? Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life. What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, "Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very..." I can't do this. Oh, okay. Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked. I'll try and think of one. When... Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice? I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care. Saleswoman has a vag*na. But I'm right? Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave? Could I have a copy of one of them? No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this. Yeah! Unbelievable. That is so great about the bonus! This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston. Michael? You said we were getting bonuses. Cancel wallpaper. You mean Toastmasters? Can I go? Been to Amsterdam. Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China. [speaks in Chinese] Michael, can you explain? Well, it's mostly made up. So... Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I k*lled. It was amazing. I'll glance at it. Of course. He's one of my closest friends. [polite clapping] No, I can't... I ca... [claps] I know what I said. I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot. [makes robot sounds] Michael Winslow, anyone? [clapping] Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened? It was amazing. I wish you would have been there. What? Something happened? Weird. Con artist. She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right? Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy] Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. [whispering] 'Cause of the... [points to 'Welcome Daughters!' sign] I reminded you last night. Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in "Raw," and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in "Daddy Daycare." both great movies, but, still. Don't you think you should say something? Michael, I think that as the boss you should really--- [in unison] That's Batman. The ocean. Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa. I'm in eighth grade. She's in middle school. Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time. It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle. Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order. Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me. Let's start with... your mom. Sasha. Ooh! [picks up train whistle] Sure. [Sasha blows into whistle continously] [plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off! There's a photo... These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these--- What's a n*zi? [standing up] n*zi was a fascist movement... ...from the 1930's... I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls. Bye, Mister Poop. [raising hands] I do, I do! You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight]. So... you cut the paper and dye it and stuff. That's not fair. [the rest of the kids agree] You're just a middleman. Wait, why doesn't the saw mill just sell paper directly to people? We have better service than they do! That is correct. Hi kids. Ewwww! Th-the hair covers it, mostly. No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay? No way. Really? What?! Right. Okay. You know, I can go with him. No! I will... go. Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office. [to Abby] Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like? I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake. [from TV] ...Bundle, are you ready to come on in? [TV children cheer] Let's have some fun! Is that a real fun sh**ting windmill? That's pretty funny. Is that Chet Montgomery? [employees chuckle] And heison TV now! Okay, next? So, whats your name? Well what's your favorite subject at school?Young Ree-cesss. So tell me, what do you want to be when you grow up?Young Hi everyone, it's one of my favorite times of the day. Did you get married? Why not? So, do you have any kids? Do you have a girlfriend? Was Chet Montgomery cool back then? Even I have a girlfriend. So you didn't get to be what you wanted to be. Meredith! I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk] Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch. Is everything okay? Uh... it's true... Mmhmm. Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend. Not Jan. If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something. Somehow. Yes. I know. Niiice. Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do. And they do, your parents, love you very much. Who is this guy again? Who uses calling cards anymore? This sounds like a get rich quick scheme. Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email? No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme? Happy birthday Michael. I said happy birthday. Thank you! That's really nice. Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have aperfectice-breaker if I ever meet Terry Hatcher. Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday. No. I'm still waiting. Yes. There he is, the birthday boy! Birthday hug! That suit is amazing. Mmm. Maybe I should get one. Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities? Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the... Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof'] No. This is a closed door meeting. Michael, I have Jan on the line. Hello, Michael. I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent. Well, today's not my birthday, so... ...Happy birthday, Michael. Am I on camera? Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. [Jan hangs up] [to Ryan, sitting across from Michael] ...You can take a five, if you want. Mmhmm, happy birthday. Who brought in donuts? Happy birthday! I... guess I forgot. Are you serious? Hi, delivery for Michael Scott. Uh... s-sure. Oh. Thanks. When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday. It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song. I probably care more than she does. Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents. Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here! Come here! 23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please. There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair. ...I'll do it. On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready? Happy birth moment, Michael. One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling] Here they come. Come and get it! Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup. These are all the same? Bologna? I don't eat bologna. No. No. Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it. Hello? Hey. No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy. Here we go. Make a wish. Yaoo yay! [claps] Pam was supposed to get 'em. No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer. [to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible. Still scary. Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine. I don't really think people are in the laughing mood. I work here. If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy. You... owe me. Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday? How dare you sir. You are gross. I'll get someone to take it down. Is that Michael? I got it. I can't relax about it, you know? No, not yet. Okay, Michael. Michael? Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson. No just the front two. Sure. Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now! Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative. Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna b*at this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin]. This is awesome. Thanks, you guys. Turn it around. Turn it around. Number one!! Michael? This is from all of us. Yeah, let's do it that way. ...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know. If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job. Well, you have... ...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have... ...and I am very proud of being a narc. Well, your office is behind you. [smiles knowingly] Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine. Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing. Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it. No you can't do that. No you cannot. It has to be official, and ithasto be urine. So, I was looking so hot... You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc. Thank you, Michael. I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind. Where did you get these facts? They are not. No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week. For the antioxidants. Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael. No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors. You can't do that. That's not random. I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of dr*gs. Uh, hmmm. Wow! He really pulled out the big g*n. Fake crying. Did not expect that. No, you will be tested. You will be. That is the law according to the rules. I'm all better. What kind of filing? That goes directly to the tester. Like in a cup? For what purpose? Then I refuse. Are you serious? But that's illegal. Not my urine. Were you forced to do dr*gs at this concert? I'd still like one. That's great. It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation. Ten minutes. Really? That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked . Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security. I don't think so. [salutes] Thank you, Michael. I need to go over some details with you. There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ... it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy. I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud g*n in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a r*fle that sh**t potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged? Thank you. Um, I don't... It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed... Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today. Since Christmas. Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please? all I do is listen. These things just have a way of working themselves out. It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it. Okay. That was the right decision for me and my marriage. Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please? Can we go? I have a lot of work to do. What's the next one? Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever? Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work. I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor. I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore p*rn. I'm talking about the... Win! That's... no... How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays? But, it... You solved it? Well, good. We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers] Mmm-Hm. I... I can't do that. That... [shakes head and places hand over the file] Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York. [sh**t twice] Nice. Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder] You already did me. Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off. [notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me? Wait, what did it say? I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?! Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know. Dwight tried to kiss me. Sure. [gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out! I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe. Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.] No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close. We sit close. I guess so... [whispering to Angela] I don't like you. I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death. Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box] Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand. No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on? Him or me? Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore. Either he goes, or I go. You choose! One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out] I am not bluffing! Okay? Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years. I deserve this. You know I do! Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match! Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage. [laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it. That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out. Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though. Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day. Sure you do, Dwight. Sure. So, you going to transfer Jim or not? I want an answer by tomorrow. Fine. Good. Okay. I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos. You mean digital? 20 bucks. You gotta be kiddin' me. One, two, three... smile. [camera flashes, but no one smiles] Try to smile. Alright, I'm just gonna take it on three... whether you smile or not. One, two, three. [camera flashes] That'll be another 20. Angela, I want to talk to you about something. I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting. You know, it was one day. Oh, dear. [off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down] It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up. [flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I? Oh, thanks. Oh, my God. [on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee. Michael? You know that I'm very serious here. What? I thought that you were their fearless leader. [laughs] I think you can handle it. I think so, Michael... Goodbye, Michael. Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day. Again? We do that every year. It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering. Yes! That doesn't exist anymore. No, they stopped making that show. We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal dr*gs or prost*tute ourselves, and donate that money to charity? Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going? I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan. Afghani. Afghani. No, that's Afghan. Wait, canine A*DS? Guys, the Afghanistananies. Okay, you know what? No. No. A*DS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried. Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here. Mike, I am not having f*re-eaters in a paper warehouse. Except my warehouse. Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease. When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection. We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen. What? Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood? I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, "Fleece it out." "Going mach five." "Dinkin' flicka." You know, things us Negroes say. Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding. [phone rings] Michael, Carol Stills for you. Carol Stills. Your realtor. [on phone] Hello, Michael? I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance. Oh, great. Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later? Oh, great. To the casino thing? What? Michael, Jan's on line two. Michael? You know, I... I thought about it and you are right. I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night. Incidentally, what is the charity? Okay, then. I will see you tonight. Bye-bye. No problemo. To answer your question... Yes. I'd love to go. I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn't be a problem. And I'll bring the papers, too. I'll see you tonight. Bye. Yeah! That's great. Hi. Hi. Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here. I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, "We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them." Drink would be good. Okay. That's my girlfriend. She was never my nurse. I met her at Chili's. She was my waitress. Chili's is great. [Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise? Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Hold'em. Good luck, everybody. That's at least four red chips to you, sir. All-in. [Other players fold their hands] I'll call. I have good cards. No, I'm sorry. He can't, sir. He's gone all-in. Flip them. Wow, bad luck. Michael? Hi. What does that mean? Okay. [Carol stares at Michael] Hey, hey. So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly? Come on, sh**t! All right. Five. Hey. I'm leaving. So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud. And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks. And you guys have a good time together. Goodbye. She seems really nice. Oh, she's great. [sobbing] Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim! [serious]False. I do not miss him. OK I think Oscar would just like if you used "lame" or something like that. Apparently you called Oscar "f@ggie" for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie. All right Michael, but Oscar's really gay. I mean for real. No, I mean he's attracted to other men. OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual h*m*. Yeah, he told me this morning. And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion. I would have never called him that if I knew. You don't... You don't call ret*rded people "ret*rds". It's bad taste. You call your friends "ret*rds" when they're acting ret*rded. And I consider Oscar a friend. No, it's fine. Jim's nice enough. I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this. [makes classic "Jim"-camera face] What is that? Of course. Absolutely not. Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so... You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive. Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay. I really don't think so. [creepy smile] Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online. Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot. What's gay-dar?Oh, oh, gay-dar, yes! No, uh, I think they have it at Sharper Image. Oh, you know what? I could check for you. No problem. [loudly fake typing] It's sold out! Yeah sorry about that, that's a bummer. You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation. OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today? Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it. All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault. NO! No, it's not possible. You know, imagine... you were gay. Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now. Do you understand? Am I the first gay man you ever knew? Uh, Michael knows Pam. He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons. Watching some of your friends. [yelling] All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight! JUST GET IN HERE! RIGHT NOW! Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up it meant lame. And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men. I'm not offended by h*m*. In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain. And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing. Judges and juries! I'm getting married to Bob Vance. That's great. Congratulations Phyllis. That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing! [laughs] See? Everybody has a chance! No, you knew me in high school. Course, we all thought you were gay in high school. Well with your ties and your matching socks and --- You sound pretty defensive Michael. I think the problem with this office is thatyouare sending mixed signals about my being here. Gay, good. I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life. I would rather not. No, NO! I don't want to touch you, ever consider that? You're ignorant, and insulting, and small! Michael... I'm sorry. That was a good idea. Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug] Michael appears to be gay too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend. [embracing Oscar]You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes. I want you to watch this. And I want you to burn this into your brains. Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come. Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this. [awkwardly kissing Oscar] I did it. See. I'm still here. We're all still here. [everyone claps] [Dwight gets up to kiss Oscar] Oh come on! Dwight! Come on, man! We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature. But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder. What is love... anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar... and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way? I am glad that today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But you know what? Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. ...that's what she said. Or he said. Yeah? No, I didn't. What was Oprah about? That's a really big decision. Maybe you should wait before you adopt. Or not adopt. Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars. You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months. Yeah. You probably won't. No, Michael. No, Michael. Sure. All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms. Uh, fun jeans. Sign. Per diem. Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power. My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight. And your veil. I'll probably just wear this. Um... Um. I got it. Um. Um.Dwight and Hey, Michael. Pretty good. Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns. It's really good to see you, man. Yeah, sold about forty thousand. Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman. Okay! What are you talking about? Step away from me, Michael. This party is going to be awesome. Check it out. Wow. That is a lot of liquor. And a dart board. We should probably head on down and hook up with Jan. Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there. Yeah. I'll do a sh*t, Michael. Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet. SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG. Thanks. I appreciate it, guys. All right, maybe. If I can. No, you cannot. Why do they call him The Bus? Smile! All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front. You don't have email on your phone. Yeah, stop by later. [into phone] See you in a bit. Bye-bye. [to Dwight] May I have a moment of your time please? Yes. Anything. So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera. He wasn't volunteering today. Oh yeah? Oh, tell him I say hi. Hey, how is... Toby? Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to... Great! Wow, oh my God, thank you. Was that your per diem? What have you generated, Michael? What party? Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you. Any messages for 308? All right. Hey, Michael. Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now. I don't think so. Fine! All right. Keep the wing flaps. Hi, Pam. Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. [to others] Pam says hi. [into phone] Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye. Come on. Nice try, Josh! Or what? We didn't bet anything, Michael. Yeah, we should go. We gotta go. Say, while I have you here, could I talk to you about some new and exciting advances to our product line? Fine. That is so true. Ready? Great. Really? They're exclusive with Staples. Well, Michael, I underestimated you. You dream in cartoons? How fun! I thought there was a party in here. This is room 308? Michael. Am I the first to arrive? Can I get a drink? Can I get a drink? Yeah. Michael... Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss. Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam. No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice. Nope, that's okay. That's all right. Are we early? Hey. Hey, uh... Arnie Reisman. Michael, Jim. No, we used to. Now we're friends. Best friends. Some people need dozens of friends to say, "Hey, look at me, I'm popular." But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Blood, urine, or semen. [waiting on Pam to be done with the microwave] Ahhhhhhhhh. [whispering loudly] I'm hungry. Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues! [directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there. Second from the end. [walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone? Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times. Entourage! Why him? Don't whine. Get the window. [Dwight exhales] Hello? [Angela coughs and points to the conference room] How would a movie increase productivity Michael? How on earth would it do that? Magically? [walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist. I have to have an emergency crown put in. Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone... three hours. [on speakerphone with Michael] Michael. I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees. No, it wasn't. Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you. Mm-hmm. You can't have people undermining you. Get control of your branch immediately. Ok. Saboteur! I'm going to k*ll you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to sh**t you. Hey. No thanks I'm stuffed. ...ok. [takes and eats several M&M's] ...so good. They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so... Oh, yeah. [long pause] Crentist. Yep. Maybe that's why he became a dentist. [reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside] Ahh. Aaaah. I know... [exhales] Well then... I am glad you're ok. Business is like a jungle. And I... am like a tiger. And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger f*re the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch? [smiling] Pun. There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head. We don't have the technology. Dwight, can I talk to you for a second? What? What is it? No. Gahh! I can't believe this news. That--- wow. You said that? Well... Gosh, if you think I should. Then I will. All right. Assistant to the regional manager. Thank you Michael, for staying on. I really appreciate it. Hey... I can't imagine this place without you. [muttering] Can't you? That's so nice. Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let's do it. You're kidding... But... why Dwight? How does that qualify him to run a branch? Because that's all it takes. Michael, what will you do? Do you have any savings? Michael, you might lose your condo. Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work. But I'm gonna keep the clothes. I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas. [smiling] No thank you. No thanks. Not my style. Well that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate. [confused] No. What did you--- Yes. You know what? No! I think the Sebring's cool. It's cool. The Seabring's cool. It has a cassette and it has a CD. [Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't f*re me. Please. [terrified] I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS! [sobbing] I'll do anything! Anything! I'll do your laundry for a month! For a year! I'm sorry! I'll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying] You can't. You can't. But I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael. What can I do? [Michael exhales] What can I do? [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do? What can I do? You can get up. Get up. [Dwight gets up with spit hanging from his lips] And you can hug it out, b*tch. [Dwight and Michael have a firm embrace] [throws some desk material in the air to signify debris from the grenade expl*si*n, grins as Jim walks away] Uh, no thanks, I'm good. Um... Yeah, absolutely. [laughs uproariously and applauds] Whoo! Thank you. Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse? Okay. [continues to laugh] Whoo! Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse? Yeah. Yes, it's better. It's great. [breathless] All right. Okay. [goes back down pretend stairs, crawls on belly to the kitchen for the coffee] [after Michael returns with coffee] With cream and sugar? [on speakerphone] So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck. Michael, Ed d*ed over the weekend. Oh, wow. Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news! You must feel so sad. That's a shame. Ed was a good guy. That's right, you worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by. Cheer me up. The news that you just announced? That Ed d*ed? Is there anything I can do? Yeah. Oh. Okay. It's a real shame about Ed, huh? About what? Ed was decapitated. He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6. He slides under an 18 wheeler. Pop. It snaps right off. What did I say? That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him. Ed was decapitated. You said you didn't know how to say it. When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I d*ed and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in. [on speakerphone] I understand how you feel, Michael. I really do. So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off? Well, what would you suggest? Of Ed? [scoffs] I'm not sure that's realistic. No, that's not--- That is not a statue, that is a robot. And how big do you want this robot? What the hell are you two talking about? You know what, Michael? I've really tried with you today... ...and I have to get back to work. So call me when you feel like having a real conversation. Goodbye. [hangs up] Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us. Did you check your... butt? Okay that's enough. We do not wanna hear about this. You have just spit on my face. Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here. Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work! There are five stages to grief, which are [glancing at computer screen] denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad. And that's hard. And it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance. And if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job. Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam. There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car. [laughing] Six? You waited for me? [grabbing ball] I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby. [throwing ball back] Nope. I will NOT. [throws ball back] Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die. [catching ball] Thanks. Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened. Me, me, me, me, me me. [catches ball] Yes. Okay, um. I was trying to throw this party once. And everyone was over for the weekend. And then my uncle Bernie d*ed, and so me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so... Well, there is a ball. No, I'm done. We really have a lot of work to do right now. Michael, look. I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die. And I had to keep going. What? It was obvious... Michael! [following Michael downstairs] Michael. Michael ... [in disgust] Oh... Poor little fella. He is a goner. Yeah. Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria! A dead bird should not be in the kitchen! You want me to flush him? I have a lot of work to do. But... [crying] [trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah! What? No, this is about the right size. I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door. You told us we had to. Actually, I have it. I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay. He's not a songbird. [singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ... Tell me what you did yesterday. Nothing? I don't care how your day was Michael. Tell me what you did yesterday. I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear? So I guess I can't get up. Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is. Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me. Because they acted all tough and everything... But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to... I'm just saying hi to Bob. Well settle down, Scott. No way. Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line. Michael. Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks. Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel. You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today. Thank you! [takes pretzel] We do. And we have 18 different toppings. We have sweet glaze, cinnamon sugar, chocolate, white chocolate, fudge, M&M's, caramel dip, mint chip, chocolate chip, marshmallow, nuts, toffee nuts, coconuts, peanut butter drizzle, Oreos, sprinkles, cotton candy bits, and powdered sugar. The Works. You got it. [Michael is listening to "Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter" and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey! I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky. Second? Account...? Michael, what is going on? What's on your suit? Night. 20 past 5. PM. These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli? This is a huge sale. Night, Michael. Here you go. It's not a dress. It's a kurta. [laughing] OK. I know. Don't go. They eat monkey brains. Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional. I don't celebrate Kwanzaa. Wha? Really? You should! It's fun. I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol. Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um... Sparkles... Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil... Thank you. I see dead people. He was dead the whole time. Yup. This is the best meeting we've ever had. I find this incredibly offensive. Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it. Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these. Yes. No. This is delightful, charming culture. [wearing cheerleader costume] I thought you said this was a costume party! An Indian woman in a sari. Nice outfit. Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol. I'll just have some bread. You used your hands. What? Too spicy? They're not s'mores. They're samosas. Do you think they have any s'mores? [song by Beyonce Knowles] Looking so crazy, my baby. I'm not myself lately. I'm foolish. I don't do this. I've been playing myself. Baby I don't care. Cuz your love got the best of me. And baby you're making a fool of me. Yes. How long have you been married to the cheerleader? She is very fair. Are you okay? Oh, Michael. Can we talk about this in private? [louder] Can we talk about this in private? [lowers microphone] Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay. This is the ninth date, Michael. I better go. Okay, you can find a way home, all right? Okay. Okay, good night, Michael. TUNA! Are you kidding me!! Here. [hands drink] Yeah. Uh... no. Well, you were never really engaged. Yeah. I kind of thought something would happen tonight too. What are you doing? I'm rejecting your... ...kiss. Good. You say one more word; I'm stopping the car. Sorry. No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later. Michael. Michael. Michael. I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch. The board voted last night to close your branch. The board's. I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service. A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages. Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person. Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael. It's... it's about talent. Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future. Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe? It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm. Hey stranger. Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile. Are you okay? What did Jan want? What can't you tell me? What?! You just said that we're gonna be gone...? Michael, what's going on? Ok, ok... Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made. Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you. What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs? Hey Mike. Look, I heard about the office. Tough break. I wasn't. Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good. Awesome. This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance. Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight. What's the plan? Can I drive? g*n! Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office. But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here. Christmas card list. This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best. So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up? No. Bad idea. You need an att*ck plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice. Yes? What is the meaning of this? Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents. Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business. [as himself] Whoa hey, why not? Okay. [as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work... Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids. [referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it? Gonna get it? Thanks, man. You, too. Totally. Nothing. [puts down binoculars] Then it was an honor to have worked with you. My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a f*re extinguisher. Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me. What were your favorite moments? What about when Jan said the branch was closing? Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go. [picks up his beeping cell phone] [on the phone] Oh my God! Stranford is closed! Michael, we're not closed. Stamford is closed. Stamford is closed. We did it! We did it! Ouu! Ou! Ouu! Ouu! In your face! Oh, man. I don't ... have no idea. I should probably get back to work. Nametag? Karen Filippelli. Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino. Okay. My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. [exhales] That's Andy Bernard. If I were you... ...I would f*re Anthony Gardner... ...before noon... ...to consolidate power. Good morning! Hello? Hannah Smoterich-Barr. Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here. You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So... As far as I'm concerned, [holds up WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] this says 'World's Best Dad'. Gardner. Michael, I didn't get a gift bag. My bag's mostly pencils. Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn... ...to knit. Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian? Hello. And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello. Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike. Nifty! They are nifty! They're nifty gifties. Right. Okay. Oh! Thanks. Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike. This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] sh**t. We need to talk! Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales? Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy? Ok. Who reports to who? And then if I want... I... I... One... I just told you. Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in! Hey, champagne. Looks like salmon. I eat beef. The beef is poisoned? Um... You might want these orientation materials. You won't be disappointed. [Lazy Scranton Video] Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty. in the Electric City! What? What? It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'. [Lazy Scranton video continues] Spot, spot, spot, spot ... [on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What? Okay. Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm... Don't... Look what's on his computer. It's my left breast. I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word. People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause. Do you have batteries? [sings drum b*at intro to 'What is Love?'] [sings] What is love? Baby, don't hurt me. Okay, here we go.Andy & Don't hurt me! Baby, don't hurt me! Baby, don't hurt me! Scuse me! Scuse me!Andy & Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Whoa-oh-oh... Whoa-oh-oh-oh. Oh, probably because of all the nose candy. Very funny, Michael! Really funny, Michael! All right, all right, I'm on a roll. Shouldn't we be equals? Uh... this is difficult, for me. No. I mean I can't physically. I can't get on the table. [starts to climb table] No, please. No. Do this. Come on. Ready? On three. One... two... three. All right. All right. Stop. Put me down. Let me go! Put me down right... Put me down! Put me down right now! I'VE HAD ENOUGH! PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW or else! Hey, hey. Easy. I'm sorry! It's just not going to work for me. I have to go. I was on the fence about this and... it's just not a good fit. I can't work here. I have to quit. No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style. No. Was it supposed to be funny? Excuse me? But there's nothing in my desk except coupons. That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you f*re him. Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club. Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together. No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King. The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it. What! Does he ever. YEAH! I don't... I don't think we can do that. Hey! Why doesn't your car have a flat tire? For crying out loud. Got an hour? I'll try to explain. Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration. Michael! Did you f*re Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit? Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance? You do? What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two. He's the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this. Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos. So who will be your new Number Three? Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb. And I have to say your leadership... has brought... Fantastic. Thank youuu. Uh, sure! Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet. We get that money for hiring an ex-convict. One of the Stamford people is a criminal? [whispering] Who is it? Hmm. Martin? Wait, why am I a r*cist? He is black... right? And... Michael? I wonder what he did. Why would anyone go to jail for that? Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that. Jackpot. I am cool. I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on. Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin? Good. Getting settled, you know? My dad. Jonas Salk. Justin Timberlake? Hey I got one. Jesus. Apollo Creed. So... you all wanna know what I was in for? Um, I really don't mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I... got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink. Yeah, some days I never go outside. Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin. Prison sounds great. No you would not. Wow. That was... wow. I can't feel my toes. What is that, like... five pounds? I'm going back inside. Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time. Yeah, in the rec room. Actually, our TV was bigger than that one. Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else. Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else? Where... did you learn all of this? So, not prison. What'd you do, Prison Mike? That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike. Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison? Wow. Prison sounds horrible. Don't encourage him, Dwight. Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter? Yeah, that... wasn't really... at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, I've seen on television. But it didn't remind me of my time in prison. Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out. Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room? Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will. You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny. [unlocks door] Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms! Oh Pam. Take a chill pill. Can I help you, Michael? It's behind you. Wow. What kind of bike is that? The tires look pretty worn. But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael? Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike. Michael? [hands over bag] I didn't, it's from corporate. Yup. Terrific. Good. Hi, is Michael around here? Michael. [whispers] What? Get outta here. [standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her. I really need a moment alone with you. [Carol heads towards Michael's office.] What is this? [Holds up a Christmas photo] No. See, we never went on a ski trip. I went on a ski trip. Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband. Michael. This is so weird. I think you're a really sweet guy. But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing [waves Christmas card]. And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us. What are you talking about? Oh, no. Michael. Michael... I'm sorry. I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing? You can't cancel a holiday. What does that mean? Michael, what's going on? [over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well? But we invited guests. Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess. I know. OK, well, why are you laying like that? Like what? Well.. um I, I don't... Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short. Copy. No, thank you. You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door] Hey, what's the haps? [Dwight shuts door in his face.] Why don't you just buy the whole song? Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie. [singing] Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. [hits repeat again] Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C'mon, my treat. That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too. No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. [do a fist bump and expl*si*n] Ah man, I can't. I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night. [Michael feels Ryan's forehead] Thanks. Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World w*r II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. [Holds up blackberry.] Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back. Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um... [to two other people at the table] Sir, I'm going to need take this chair. I can't... I can't here what you're saying. [off screen at other end of table] What're you talking about? [still off screen] Carol had a mustache? [off screen] What are you guys talking about? It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face] Who are you calling? I think he'd know. [Dwight and her stare at each other] I don't know. You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya? This drink... [in audible conversation with Michael] I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good. Excuse me. Cindy, Cindy. I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day. [referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding! What? Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy. Oh, you are such mench my friend. [They stand up and do fist bump and expl*si*n] I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too. That rocks. Thanks! I, I wanna give you something. Oh. [She whispers in his ear. Michael starts to laugh] That's what she said. Is he the hot one or the giant baby? [under her breath] There's another party in the break room. You can't have it [takes back toy] I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack. Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey! [singing] I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but... Do I agree about what? What're you talking about? OK.Andy and [singing] Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan... Right. Which one is she? [Michael stares at both waitresses] Dude, you should know. Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike. I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like? You know where I am. Oh. Hey. Hey. This party blows, so we're gonna leave. Cool... I... We're just gonna take off. No... I have school. [leaves with other waitress and bicycle] [singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed... No. She wasn't. Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago. Sorry. You what? Yeah. You just had a rebound. Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart. [singing, with Dwight holding up microphone] Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum.. I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in! Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed. OK. It's kind of serious. How was Jamaica? Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here. My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised. They said I should talk to you. I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check. I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a "for rent" sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away. That's good. [Michael continues to play conch shell] Huh. It's kind of an impoverished country. But you can't today, we're doing inventory. We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed. I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it. Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans? By the end of the day? That's impossible. Michael, there's no way we can do it in time. How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some f*re dancers. That's all you need. Oh yeah, oh my God. No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue. Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan. Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked. You took the ice queen? I don't buy it. They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim. No. Well, no. I got nothing. Yeah, Mike, still nothing. Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture? He's in the office. All right, what's up Mike? Yup. Uh huh. Yup. Really? Who's the target? What's it of? Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment. Hey I need to talk to you right now. About you and Jan. Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship. Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now. You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR. All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it. All right, thanks Michael. [on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you. He'll call you back. OK, great. Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse. No, it's... involves the photograph. [starts clapping] Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done. That corporate booty, he likes to h*t it! Jan. Urkel Grue. My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right? Hey. What are you doing out here? Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you. I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom. There were. A lot of them. Hello everyone. Hello Michael. Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office. Why am I here, Michael? In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me? I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself. This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks. This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you. Good, good. Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time... Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo. I am Harvey, a computer. Jim sucks. Yeah, you can. For this? Me so horny. Me love you long tim. Who is 'Long Tim'? Thank you. [Puts candy back] I... I don't want those. Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael? Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott. Ph. D. Doctor of Sales. Well, it is very gracious of you to accept. Oh, uh, thanks. Pass. I am very flattered. I was his second choice after "Pass." Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage. Yup? Yeah! You want shirts on hangers? He does your laundry? Wait, "Amazing Race" like, the biggest sale wins? Is there a prize? Then how is this "Amazing Race"? Michael. [Michael throws Phyllis' keys under the car.] Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first. What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry? I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know? My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons. Yes, it is. [Walks up to the counter where there is no employee] Hello? Yep. Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a r*fle from the crow's nest. Also sh*t a deer once. Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past. Oh, man, that is, like, poetry. I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree. Oh man. Talk about your classic "Lame dash O." Do we even want that guy buying our paper? I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up. I really 'Schruted' it. 'Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute? Hey boss. Got a minute? I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning? That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something? No, you are remembering it wrong. Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote "Beeswax. Not yours, Inc." Hey, we nailed the sale! I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow. I am not a liar. Stay out of this, you! Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company. That's what she said. I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this. I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win. The cost of doing business. Was the top salesman... [chuckles] Addition by subtraction. Mmmm. Yeah you're right. Hey, boss. Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right? Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my "Lost" on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out? Well, I will take that as a maybe. [Michael gets up] Where are you going? [scoffs] Child's play. Give me something hard to sell. Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it? Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight. Feel ya, dawg. Absolutely. You said... [makes gibberish noises] Which is like, "Right on." And Pam was like "blah blah blah" and you were like "Yeah, psht." Nailed it. I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party. Michael -- Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe. Fine. Party pooper. Yeah, me too. Sort of. He had a lot of clients. Oh, sure, we talk all the time. No. [takes the phone] Hmm. I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me. Yes. None of them. Especially not Andy. Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with? Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. sh*ts. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll h*t the tiz-own. Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that. [to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you. Hey. Same old. Oh my God, she told you? Accepted. [scoffs] The boss isn't funny. I don't get to wear my ties. So? I don't want to do your laundry anymore. Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- [Angela walks away] it's great. Thank you. You did this for me? [camera pans to "Welcome Back Oscar" sign] Well, draw me a map, mama. No, I will not. It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase. [long pause and then he sighs and nods] Yes. Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata] How do you know it's going to be a boy? How, would you stop interrupting please? Yesterday I was scraping some g*n off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock. And when I came to, I had an epiphery. Life is precious. And if I die I want my son to know the dealio. The dealio of life. Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to. [Shakes head] What? No. No. [Leaves] Come on. Ow. Well you get the picture. Thanks Pam. What if he's a m*rder? Maybe that's how you die. I want to do this. Action. Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night. So... I'm sorry. I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant. I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes. Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome. A lot better than hers, that's for sure. It'll probably be on a boat. Nothing. You know this is a luncheon shower. Girls only. Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight! What happened? Quick somebody help! Help the man! [Pretends to kick Michael] No, no, no! I have a full day of sales calls. [Breaks pencil.] And what kind of stripper did you get? You didn't order a stripper? Have you ever even been to a bachelor party? Mike, okay, a stripper is bachelor party 101. If you don't get a stripper your party is going to suck it hard. Just get one for the girls too. That evens it out. You know, separate but equal. So that's what that means. Alright! Uh! [Spanks himself] What? Yeah. Don't fall asleep at your desk. [Turning towards the vending machine] Oh my God. I'm on it. Nice. Do you have any blonde women? He hasn't even said a word yet. Just giggling. Are you okay? Ah, gotcha. Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants. Yep, Spongebob Squarepants. Hold the door please! Thank you. Hello! [Spits champagne back into her glass] Thank you for that introduction, Mr. Scott, and good afternoon fine gentlewomen of Dunder Mifflin. Knickers in fact, yes! Well, actually, I never was president. Ah. I'm here to teach you a little bit about my life and the era of the founding fathers. Wait, this is the entertainment? Uh, well that is a grey area of my life. Okay? So, it was a warm June evening. Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on? Oh gross. Well, you're very saucy! [Winks at Pam.] Michael, Dwight would like your man meat. Okay. The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild. Michael. Hi guys! h*t it. [Feel Like Makin' Love plays in background] So where's the groom? Absolutely not. That's all you. That's all you. Just sit on down. Alright. Here we go. Yeah! Mmm, what's that? I bet she'd be jealous. [Rips off shirt] Ohhh. You know Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son. But I kept all this from my wife Deborah. These things only serve to upset the women. They are the gentler sex. Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag. Secrets, secrets are no fun. Secrets, secrets hurt someone. [On speaker phone] Michael, I left a meeting. What is so urgent? Are you, are you okay? Okay. Uh when, when did, when last night? You went to a bachelor party at work? Thanks. I'm closer to f*ring you. I'll talk to you later. You are. You are. I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise] Okay, for this next one everyone hop out. Just Phyllis and Dad. Actually, let's bring Mom back in. And the sisters. And you, and you, and you. Great. Also, Pam and Roy. Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside. Yes, very. No. That wasn't me. I thought it was... Michael... No. I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone. Okay. You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet. [in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you! I lookreallygood in white. That's my dress. [generalized clapping] This is bull****! Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight. I do. And do you, Bob... You may now kiss the bride. Thanks Angela. If you ever lay I finger on Phyllis, I'll k*ll you. Oh! It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet. It's fish. I will take care of that. Cheers. Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance. One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines "wedding" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride "Mawige... The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones. Oh okay. That's enough. Thanks, Michael. Give me... Give me the microphone. Give me... Give me the microphone, Michael. You're out of here! Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical. I can't let you in, Michael. No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders. You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure. I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance? Toby! Yeah! Phyllis and you will be great together. The Celtics were a great team. Nobody ever helped me. I had to do it myself. Even the doctor didn't know! Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head. You found Uncle Al! Thank you, Michael. You're... You're welcome. They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad. My tire blew out on the way here, Michael. I almost d*ed. I... I went into this skid--- ...What? I almost d*ed. You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class. If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupidnotto do it, right? A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us. Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing. What? Y-You understand nobody's graduating. ...It doesn't apply. Quit it! ...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure. [on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me... ...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off... And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott. If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a "sylvania." Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ. Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art. Michael. What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing. Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world? What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain? Has anyone ever come back? How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger? ...What? By your own employee's calculation you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years. [locks bat in break room] I... am a hero! But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain? But there's five Goliaths, there's... Staples, Officemax... But in the big picture... ...It wasn't personal. Pack my--? Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to f*re me. To the annex? Where... Kelly is? Thanks for coming. Oh, Michael. Yep. What do you mean? Um... you wanna buy it? Uh-huh. [hugs Michael] ... Thank you. Do you have something in your pocket? No thank you. Okay. Yes. But this [pulls at straight jacket] seems to be... And now, the chains. A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school. I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath. Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you? So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead? No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. [Michael spits out key, Jim covers it with his foot.] Is everything ok, Michael? Yes. I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key... [trumpet sounds] It's early bird gets the worm. Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great. "Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?" Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special. Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car. Yeah. Thanks. Oh. Um. I think we're good. Thanks for inviting me along. Michael? Hi. Let's just blow this party off. Am I on speaker phone? Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone. Ok. Let's just go to a motel... ...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica. Still on speaker? Are camera's there? See you soon. Talk to you later, Jan. I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy. Salad. You dressed exactly like the servants. Wait. I don't think yours will fit me. That would have been really embarrassing. Crisis averted. Oscar. Angela. Hi. Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend. It's from both of us. Wonderful, let's, ah, see where we can put this. Ok. Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here. Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces. I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR. You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company. I've never told you that I love you. What's this over the "i"? Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying? Hello Michael. From the Scranton Branch. Excuse me. So did the merger go smoothly, or? I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management. Can I get anyone anything, or? Martini please. Does that include the garage? It's a common question. This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch. You ok? Sure. No, it was before I knew you so, its fine. It's nice. I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family. Oh. I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes. Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael] Don't you know what I'm doing? Shut up. Come on. What? Just let me loosen my dress. Michael. Slam me up against the wall, right here. Oh, please. Did you get a chance to try Michael's homemade potato salad? Damn jet skis! I feel sick. No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public. Please don't cry. It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him. I didn't mean it. I was... Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it. That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it. Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray] Michael, last Friday one of your employees att*cked another employee in your office! [sigh] Is Toby there? Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his... All right, well are you gonna take care of this? What did I tell you about "yeppers?" I told you not to say it. Do you remember that? [flustered] Well... good for Dwight. Where'd you get that? Wikipedia. Wikipedia... is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information. Hey, Mike. Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise. I can't hear you. Still nothin'. No. Nice. Okay. And what happens in this one? Okay. Can I have a raise? [softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher. What? I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what happened. I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly. But, if he did intend that? Wow. Genius. You ready for me? Cool. Okay. No, you know what? Let's stay here. No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room. Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws 'em off. Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control. Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now. Are you wearin' lady clothes? Are you wearin' lady clothes? Those look like lady... pants. That there's a woman's suit. I'ma call Roy, man. This is gonna make him feel better. This is too good. You're wearing a woman's suit? No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin. Who makes it? Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining? Did you see... So, none of that tipped you off? Michael, the pants don't have any pockets. [Laughing, covering her mouth] Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet? Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton. Okay, can you just stand right there? [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails. When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings. Roy just att*cked him. I'm not sure which one Jim hated more. Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. With Roy gone we got a smaller crew. And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise. What? I can't hear you. I can't--- what, Mike? Are you--- Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it. Why can't I just... tell you? There you go. I am serious, Mike. That's a 10% raise. That's what I want. Come on, be for real Mike. [laughs] Are you serious? You're earning this? Mike, this is barely more than I make. You been here ten years, dog. [laughs] Ho-ho! Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one. [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs] Ok, let's take 15, again. Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you. Here's the $40 you gave me. [on cell phone] Fourteen years. Fourteen. I know. [laughing] Ok, alright. I gotta go. Later. [hangs up] What? That's 'cause of you, Mike. They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss. Get your own raise. You gotta get out there and earn, son. Well, when they merged the two branches together, they putyouin charge. Okay, and we're shippin' more now than we ever have. Yeah that's true. You gotta call your girl, and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship. Yeah, you should. Fourteen years long. Make it happen, cap'in. Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends? Today. All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five? Great. Uh, and listen. Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present. Da--- Darryl from the warehouse? No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep. So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby. Michael, he's your branch's HR rep... ...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship. You know this. Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it. No, I said your idea was stupid. Where? Comfortable, Mike? No. Thank you. I haven't been to New York in a long time. Oh you could stay too. He's got a big place. Mm, it's not that big. Busses, though. They get you home quick. Okay, bring it home now. And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you. Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello. Come in. [exhales] Ah, Okay. That's my new assistant. I have to call you the second I get a new assistant? Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation. All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside. Are we clear? Right now we can offer you a 6% raise. Oh, God. Michael--- Michael--- [under his breath] Didn't think you'd notice... Okay, Michael. Please, why don't we just take a break. This is really going nowhere. What's wrong with you? Okay, Michael. I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15. No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it. Okay? No. But we can offer you 12. But you just said 15. Damn you. Now, this is the forklift. You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine. That means the upstairs office workerscan'tdrive it. ... Quiz! Mike. Should you drive the forklift? It's not safe, you don't have a license. Madge. No, it's always been Madge. Her. Yes, "her" is qualified to work a dangerous machine. You are not. Okay? Do you understand that? We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year. This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled... How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler? These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,Michael, should not go anywhere near them. What thehellis wrong with this man? Don't disrespect the baler! No do not touch it! There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay? Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome. It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour. For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour. Um, yeah. You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour. Take them at the same time. You know, anything that warms you. Yeah, that dim light is a b*tch, ain't it? Actually, you did. Sedentary. That's called having a fat butt, Michael. Yeah, yeah. That's, that's fat butt disease. That's what you suffer from? Alright, we outta here. That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike. It's serious down there. We do dangerous stuff, man. This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball. You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life. Sittin' on your biscuit. Never havin' to risk it. Okay. ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore? Okay. I don't understand the question. Yeah... It's really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals. So, you're okay? Indubitably. Idiots! God, what are we gonna do!? Wolves. Visual A*DS. No time to sew a quilt. ... I got it. Give me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store. [on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops! We measured it once... Seedless? Ready? [drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds] Okay. Got it. We're not allowed to use the baler. Oh yeah, this is much better. Safer. Excellent decision. When you land, try and land like an eight year-old. These bouncy castles are not designed for adults. Do you wanna do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk! That's right! Doing! Totally doing! It's rock n' roll! Yeah! [imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near! [singing] Michael is awesome! Jumpin' off the roof! [singing] Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce! Show 'em who's boss! [singing] Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun! [outside] Come on, hurry up you guys! [on megaphone] Michael, what's wrong?! Depression? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out? Is that the last year the data was available? Don't do anything rash! I didn't... [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn't think you needed them for this part. you said to just... Okay, I'm on it! Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange! Michael! What's wrong? Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out? Well, you know, the first performance was a little off. But I really think they h*t their stride, in the second show. Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee. No, there's nothing to see over there, people! There's nothing to see. ...They found the castle, Michael. Hey Michael! I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it. Come down and... open it and you'll see. Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan. Mike, this is the opposite of safety. You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself. Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for. A lot... of things. Uh, you, uh... What about Jan? Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man. It's goin' good, right? Mike, you're a very brave man. I mean, it takes courage just tobeyou. To get out of bed every single day, knowing full well, you gotta be you. I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong. And I ain't that brave. Waybraver! You Braveheart, man. Come down, okay? Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present. [on phone] I am upset. Don't I sound upset? [on phone] It is disgusting. I totally agree. Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper. We have a crisis. Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock. Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing... unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like. I've never been a fan. Cri-Man-Squa? F and C, doubletime? One more. Why are you talking like that? Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time. Here. Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill. And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens. That's really not our job. [getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache. I'm just preparing. Yeah, I gotta call out on that. All right. I'll go. Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone. We're having a press conference? Not! [scoffs] Here's the thing. When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media, and then you control the story. Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you. That's what happened to O.J. Oh, did the press ask for a story? No. Hello, I'm looking for Michael Scott. Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client. Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really. [snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this. Well it isn't ended. I'm... I'm very angry. I--- I could have lost business. I don't accept your apology. The watermark was obscene and horrifying. ...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something! Well, it--- it doesn't help, because it already happened to me. May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling. I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right. I, for starters, I think that you should resign. You're the head--- You're the head of the company! Yes, and that makes it your responsibility--- And so you should lose your job! Fine. It's non-transferable... I'm calling the Better Business Bureau. Everything. It's just the Scranton Times... You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two. Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman's touch. [Dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into Michael's hair] OK, I think that's good. Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team. I'm just saying... They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade. You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb. Cut. Cut. Cut. Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five] One day for what? OK. Cut. That was your best apology video ever. [whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering] Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot. Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down. What is so funny? I'm guessing not. It's disgusting and demeaning. Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the... What's going on? I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response. I don't think the women in this office - I was at a parent-teacher conference. Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong. [on speakerphone] Michael, ... ...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body. I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser. $300? Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free. Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on. [lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert. Look at that one. Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand] [reads memo] "Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors." Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela] Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect. Yes. Did you hear that, Michael? Wait a second, how are you qualified for that? [eating banana] Mm, less than three. Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car. You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women. Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal? What a surprise. Alien. Blagh! What you're saying is extremely misogynistic. I'm saying that you're being sexist. Michael. When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian. And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods. Can we just get back to work? This is not work talk. Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10. More like, "Aye, aye, General." It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot. I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway. Thank you, Michael. What do you want to dish about? Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome. Oh, it can be fun. It's a pretty common one. Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with. Oh, my God. That is not healthy behavior. Michael, you need to get out of this. No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying] Read the pros first. OK, OK. Um, cons. What was the last one? No, the one before that. Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy. Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes. Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other. I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan? My mom taught me that. No one said it has no calories. Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here. [wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly. [in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up. Don't answer it. Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right? Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on. I think I've got it. I don't think we really need that, Michael. You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs] Good luck, Michael. OK, remember, be strong. Don't leave a - Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry. So... we're good? [cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry. One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner? OK. [voice on phone] "It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want..." Oh. [door closes] OK, where does it hurt? No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body. [reading from screen] "Abdomen. Menses." "The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it." Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste? Michael? David Wallace is on line one. The CFO? Ohh... OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK. [on phone] Michael, I am calling--- Jan is out of town right now. Michael? Michael? Michael? I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate. Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch. That's not necessary. Yes. Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitelynotwearing anything underneath] Oh, yeah... I packed it in my purse. I don't wear a Speedo, Michael. Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30. It's Beach Day... Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here. Thanks Toby. I thought we were just having fun at the beach. We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me. You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities? I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day? [singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right." [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done. Oh, sweet mother of God. Excuse me? Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach. I hope there will be management parables. Like what? Well... no, I don't... exactly... what? Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures. [sighs] Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you. Everyone put on sunscreen. What? Yes! Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam. I choose Michael! OK, temp. Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot. OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that. I don't care what you call my team. No [crosses arms], the blue team. We will be team U.S.A. Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic. I don't really trust him. There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon. There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. [holds up notes] [begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs] Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs? When's the contest? How am I supposed to... get... Thanks a bunch. A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success. Can I have a turkey burger? It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table] Is there any mustard? No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily. [eating hot dog] What is it? You can't say, or you can't pronounce it? Can we just take those first two things? You're leaving? Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis? I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on! One came up. If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me. Get 'em big boy! What are you doing? [Andy and Dwight sumo wrestle] Gaaaaa.... Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa! Angela! I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units. I really doubt it, Michael. I don't! How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus. Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through f*re! I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right? I'd like to try it. But I'm not kidding. I really want to do it. Nope. Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get b*rned. That's harsh. Why don't you go Michael? And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself. Do you want us to count to three? Three. Two. One. One. Two. Three! Go! Do it! Go, Michael. On the go that's after three. No! It's okay. I will do this Michael. [standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB! GIVE ME THE JOB! Aggggh, that stings! Or Mrs. "Outside Hire." Who's Bob Hope? Oh, like Amanda Bynes. She's from "What a Girl Wants." Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement. Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York. [finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts. [runs over after walking over f*re coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that. Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist. [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends. And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day. Flintstones, meet the Flintstones. They're a modern stone-age family. Ba-ba-da-da-da. From the town of Bedrock, they're a page right out of history. Ba-da-da-da-da. [overlapping singing of the wrong verses] When you're with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, a dabba-doo time, we'll have a gay old time! [confused] Oh, Michael? Isn't our interview tomorrow? You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan? In the middle of a work day? Okay. We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people. I don't think so. I believe we put you in charge. Okay, Michael. I'm really looking forward to our interview. And I'm really looking forward to working with you. After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you. You wanted to see me? But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe. Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry] Thank you. [cries harder] Thank you, Michael. [sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much. [sobbing] Thank you. So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city. Whoops. Heh. Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right? All right. Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving? Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking. Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York? Maybe you should talk to her? Before... I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense. Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo... You're not sure that you have the job. Yes you will. [walks through front door] Michael. Uh, how are you? I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute? I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things. Okay. Okay. What do you want me to do? What about Meredith? No. She's an alternate. Been good. Good. Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail. After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation. To kinda clear my mind. It was. Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know? Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time. I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together. Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room] What are you gonna do? Do you want to get back together with her? Just don't get back together with her. How can she make you get back together with her? This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her. You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong. Right. Do it. I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you. [walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged] So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently. I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities. And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation... Let's get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs] 'Cause I'm going to get the job. Thanks. Oh, okay. Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right? Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye. What happened? Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger. I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim. Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street] Uh, no, we're good. Thanks. [points at bearded man] Who's that? Beardy? I'm gonna introduce myself. No, no, no, just... that's not his real name. That's just what I call him, so... Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug] Uh, administrative assistant. I think she's comin' in... later. Sure. Okay. I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, "Absolutely, I do." Michael, good to see you! Oh, great. I've been meaning to thank you by the way. You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget? That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat. What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager? Okay. And your strengths? Oh. Yes. Very good. What do you think we could be doing better? Okay! Thanks for comin' in, Michael. It is always a treat when our paths cross. You're back together. Okay, uh. Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job. Hey you! How was your interview? Yeah? Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you. What? What's... what's the matter? What... what happened in there? [opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these? The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company. You are clearly unstable. Yeah! Okay, you know what? I'm just not leaving. I'm not leaving. Not leaving. Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored]. Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction. No, we're not giving you the job. I do. Yes. Oh, God! I mean, I just don't understand! It's justsorude, you know? I mean, the absolute nerve of that guy! Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know? It's fine, actually, I do. I really think it's great that it happened. Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs] [sobbing] Oh, I know, I know. It's just... I'm sorry. It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery. Ohhh! They make my moods totally unpredictable! Wow! What am I gonna do? 15. [laughs] It could work. This could work, really! How'd it go? No. No, Pam. I'm baaaaaack! For gooood! Kevin Nealon. To intimidate my subordinates. It was Andy's idea. I don't do that stuff anymore. No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids. Did... Karen get the job?
