Alright. Okay. Here we go. Alright! Not bad! Not bad! You smell nice. Like Tide. You smell like Tide detergent. Do you use Tide detergent? Ha ha ha! I have a girlfriend so... Elizabeth, I want you to sit here. When the phone rings, answer it. We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it. Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women?
