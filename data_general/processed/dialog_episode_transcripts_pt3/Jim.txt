All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library? So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper? [singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] Whassup! [Strains, grunts] What? OK. All right. See you later. I have an important question for you. Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday? Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. What? Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate. You can't do that. Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ. No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin. OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him? And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O. Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do. Yeah. So when are we going out? Hey, man. OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes. It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going. Yeah, yeah. Just tell her I'll talk to her later. No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do. Hey. Hey. Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with... It's better, thanks. Yeah. Is...? Um... Are you... Yes. Yeah. Great. Let me just... Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend. Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of b*at me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited. That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, "100% post-consumer content." What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second. Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually. Retaliation. Tit for tit. Well, it should be. This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right? Yeah, Freecell. I know. I saw that. I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch. Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please? It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day. "I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..." Open-mindedness, is that even a word? "...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck." [Laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that. OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim? ...empathy, respect... [Phone ringing] Jim! Jim! You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too expl*sive. No pun intended. But I just though. "Too soon for Arabs." Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court. Chappelle's Show. I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space. Great. She's cute, huh? Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch. [trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority. That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice. [stirs] Mmmm. Oh. Sorry. That's fine. I'm doing it right now. To you. No. I have a life. You should try it sometime. There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers. Yeah! Really? Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this? Yes. I can do it. I'm your man. Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office. Same thing. Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior. Oh gee, then why do I have an office? Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it. Sure. Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system. OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do. OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so... I'm inventing new diseases. So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that? Nice. All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them. Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony. You did this, didn't you? Yes you did. I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one! The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] "Count Choculitis" Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula? I think you need to confess... ...the fact... What are you doing? Those are my keys. [looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green... Let me out. Let me out or you're fired. Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk. [on phone] Hey, Jim. It's Pam. Good, how are you? Busy? Um, I'm not bothering you, am I? You don't have anything you're doing? Jim! I might go to the mall. I need new shoes. Do you want to form, an alliance, with me? Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected... Did you get your tickets? The g*n show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep] An alliance? What does that even mean? I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure. Did you tell Pam about the alliance? Just now. Right, that's good, good, pursue this. Mmm hmm. Done. They seem awfully chummy, don't you think? Only one way to find out. I'm on it. What? I believe it. I could tell, from the body language. Italian. Yeah. Good, let 'em. It helps our cause. I love their sandwiches. Their bread's really good. Damn it. God! God... Damn it! Why us? [whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second? Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues? Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, "These people are my friends." But he's all like, "This is confidential. You can't tell anybody." But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything. Jackpot. You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time. Oh my God, we have to be there. No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God. I know. I know exactly what to do. This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything. Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet. So tape it down. Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box. Happy birthday... No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone. He's in a box? Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal. Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time. No, don't. Don't do that. Oh, tell me, tell me. OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no. [laughing] That's perfect! [yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert? Hey, Hey! Come on. It's just office pranks. So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim. [on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years. Uh, [in a nerdy voice] "I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword." Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that. Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now. I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance. Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you. Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here. Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones. Yeah, you're gonna need it. Whoa. [laughing] I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive. And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so... Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake. Hey, there he is! Secret w*apon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go! OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you b*at us, you're fired. That's a joke. OK, let's do it. OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy. Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut! [Michael looks away and misses Jim's pass] Whoa! What's going on? What's going on? You're playing like a bunch of girls. What the hell man? [laughing] You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word. Mmm-hmm. Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh? Why don't you get on that? What are you gay? What is your type? Stay away from my mom. Engaged, yeah. Pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems. Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot. Assistant to the Regional Manager. That's true. True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name. Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know? They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions. What's that? I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls. No. Like those? Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going... No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go. [smiles] [mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that. Oh! Oh... Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad. [whispering] Here he comes, shhh... [smiles in agreement] Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons? [nods] That's what he said. Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you. Hi. I'm Katy. You sit out there, don't you? Okay, um... Okay. [laughs] [Under his breath] Still. I'm bored. No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend? Really? What are you guys going to do? That's great. That's cool. I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move. 'Cause Roy's got a truck. Uh, huh. Yes. Great. Okay, I'm gonna head back. See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim. Where you going? Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool. Thanks. Take it easy. You got that? Good. Here. Squeeze it inside. Why? It's a... it's a very nice car. Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. [holds up a trophy of a business man] And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, "Hey, did you get an award?" And the neighbor will say, "No man. I mean, I sl*ve all day and nobody notices me." Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So... [in a Fat Albert voice] Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert. So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera? I'm not changing that, it's the best one. That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier. You staying? [in a stereotypical oriental accent] Herro everybodeeee. I'm gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould. Oh no, I just, I decided to stay. I'll just get a ride home from Angela. Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping. No. No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink! [laughs] Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom. Woo! Hey, I haven't gotten one yet! More Dundies!Pam and Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman. [Pam hugs Michael and gives him a quick peck on the cheek] Oh! Thank you. What a great year for the Dundies. We got to see Ping. [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding][Jim looks at the camera, then back at Pam, who is still nodding] Nothing. What? I don't know, what?[Pam starts laughing, then suddenly falls off the bar stool] Oh my God! You are so drunk! Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy. Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush- Oh my God! I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!! Whoa. I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall. No you don't. Hey, um, can I ask you a question? Um, I just wanted to say thanks. Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.[Jim opens the door for her] Bye. [clears throat] Hey, what's up? Any emails today? No? Um... Check your spam folder. What? [laughs uncontrollably] Kay. Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button. Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything. [monkey noises] I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody. mmhmm. Oh really? Ok, you know, Michael... I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim? Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things. Mmmhmm. Yes. Maybe. You see Dwight's coffee mug? Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it. Here. Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight. Oh. [paper football lands on desk] Ooh. Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know. Eh. It's a scoreboard. Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out. Or when we're bored. We're bored a lot. Sweet! We call it Hate Ball. Because of how much Angela hates it. Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... [turns around] no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home. Let's go check out the master bedroom. Yeah, I got a game. It's called "work hard so my kids can go to college." Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin. It smells like cookies. I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work. Uh. [breathes deeply, head at knees] Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton. In English, box of paper snowshoe racing. The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens. I'll do it. Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs] Pair of shoes! It's Phyllis! Flonkerton. [empties bowl of M&M's into his mouth] Apparently. Are you calling me a ho? OH! I did. I made something for our closing ceremonies. a*t*matic voicemail. Ow. Go! Go! Go! What is going on? That's my stopwatch. Great. I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid? I have 59 voicemails. Sure. Really? Cool. Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on? Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly. You know. What's this? I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment. Yep, not as good as gold. [national anthem plays] Why are you playing the national anthem? Oh. [doves move across cord] What the hell is that? Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second. Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud? [to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension. I don't want to be like "a guy" here. You know? Like, Stanley is the "crossword puzzle guy". And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the "something guy". Ooh. ...Would You Rather? [to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a... A Purpose Driven Life. No. The DaVinci Code! is there f*re wood on the island? Then I would bring an axe, no books. Fine. Physician's Desk Reference. Yeah. Okay. Thought people read more books. Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County... Legends of the Fall? Well, I kind of liked Legal... I take it back. I take it back! You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me. Okay. Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused... Yes. In my top three, so suck it. Breakfast Club. Um... The Princess Bride and... No, my all time favorite! All time favorite. I'm really uncomfortable. Present company excluded? Pam. ["Everybody Hurts" by R.E.M.] Think you've had too much / in this life. Okay, um... Everybody hurts, Why didn't I go to business school? The temp. Dwight. I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway. Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins. Hey! Guys, what's going on? Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do? [clears his throat] Hi! How are you? I'm good. It's good to see you. I'm hungry. Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers. Um, for the... the desert island. I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car. Okay. Alright! You want to drive? [eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be? That's great! Okay, greatest strength. But that doesn't sound good. Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types] He's a g*n nut. [on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim's attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott. Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job. Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge. Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God. [clearing his throat and interrupting Jim's talking head] Can I speak to you a minute? Um... yes. Help. Me. I want you to role play f*ring me. I want you to f*re me, and I will take it. Yes. I want you to be me, and I will be Creed. No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head. Yes, that's a good idea. Aaaahh! I'm gonna k*ll myself! I'm going to k*ll myself, and it's your fault! Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month. I... this is Creed. I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings] And I'm very angry, and I want... I'm gonna k*ll you. I'm going to k*ll you for f*ring me. What happened? Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was... Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out. [motions for her to follow him] Come on. Where is my desk? This is not funny. This is totally unprofessional. I didn't lose my desk. Okay, who moved my desk? Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished! [In bathroom, answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times. It's by the ream? ...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%. Wash your hands, Kevin. [Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai... Dwight... Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai. No, that was my Sensei. I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei. Assistant Sensei. Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell? What's her address? [Ryan's cell phone rings] [Reading Jim's palm] You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks. I am just following the website. Yes, you have very nice teeth. [in a high pitched voice] This is Mike Tyson. Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me. Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you. Ok, give that back to me. No. That is not a toy. Please? No women or children, unless provoked. Warehouse guy. Doesn't count. Because I would kick his ass. So? I've beaten up black belts. And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again. Just h*t me. You'll see. Oh, q*eer... [realizes he is on camera] eye. q*eer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it. Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass. Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not. I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World w*r II veteran. k*lled 20 men then spent the rest of the w*r in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight. I don't know. French Onion? Ok. Ok, alright, where is Dwight? You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now. why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools. Oh. What? Well, look closer. Once point for me. Oh, you're dead. Later Jim. [entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet? I've got Michael's lucky tie. Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals... She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out. What is going on? No, they had to come back for me. Wait, not Roy. Say it's not your fiance. [laughs] Sure. There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse. It is a screenplay. Starring himself. Of the FBI. What is that? [to waitress] Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please? Yeah, yeah. That's the character's name? Ok, you guys should not be doing this. You took something that doesn't belong to you. Brought it in here- Made copies of it- [singing] Chili's baby back ribs... [looks around conference room] You're joking right? Michael's movie? Two thumbs down. [Smiles] Heh. Ok, you know what? I am done with this. That's it, the end. Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now. Yeah. You said "World, this is my blood! It's red, just like yours. So love me!" I had plans to meet a friend tonight. Which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer. For the bugs. Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan? What are you going to do with your time off? [points to Jim's iPod] You have new music? And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. [to camera] Jan, I defend your honor. [to Dwight] Is that all? What!? Oh, I don't know... [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God. This is Jan's cell. do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don't know. That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship. It's, uh, [phone rings] Excuse me. Hello? Hi! Just talking about you. The camera? No. Uh huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What. Ok. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No. [to camera] Would you excuse me? [to Jan] No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm. No, no. [goes under his desk] This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have. Right. No. Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people. Only other people. Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk [to camera which is now under desk] Excuse me? Excuse me?! [to Jan] I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no. I didn't slip you something! Oh, really? Why might some say that? Uh hmm. We didn't dance. Swaying isn't dancing. I have some faxes to get out. Oh, come on, Pam. I- [bouncing on an exercise ball] You should get one of these. Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts. This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim's desk] Sorry. Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex. Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that. It's only twenty-five bucks. Oh, hey, listen, Jim. Here's a little tip for your performance review. Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders. Oh, yes, we do. Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise. Uh, that is so stupid. What if he gives it to you? Ugh, you know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday. Uh, stupid. Uh, duh. Duh. Michael and Jan definitely made out. Maybe more. Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K? Saturday. Hey, Jim. Oh my God, did you see "The Apprentice" last night? Can you believe who Tr*mp fired? Do you think Michael and Jan actually... How do you come back from that? No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that? As a human being. 20; where the hell's Dwight? It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania. [sees man in a turban outside] Oh my God. Ohhh. [dials phone number] Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. Oh, we have a serious problem here. [goes out onto office floor] Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights. Pretend you're not here. [whispers to Jim] Hey. Something just happened. Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately. I know! Do you think that they're like- No, right, no, no. Of course. Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles. This is a meal in a cup. Yeah! They were the most fun. We always invited them. on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight- I was wondering- Why? Like who? Who doesn't know? Why just Michael? Is it? Oh, that's perfect! I won't. Ok. Really? That's great. Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere. Oh, no, he can't make it. Hey there. Almost quittin' time. One more hour. Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out. You have plans. I do, too. I do, too. I do, yeah. Big plans. Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no. Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds- Yeah. It's the best. It's the best. I would not miss it for the world. But if something else came up, I would definitely not go. It is. Ok. [someone coughs] What? Have fun tonight! Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. [to the camera] He has no idea! You don't work with us. Thanks. Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions. Jim, come here. When is the guest of honor coming? He's gonna love it! Hey. Definitely. Hey, is Katy coming? Huh, is it ok if I call her? Jim's bedroom. Cool... This is your desk. Your home office? Down. You have to sit down so I can get the full effect. Ok, wait, so that would make me [walks to side of room] like right here. And Dwight would be like- Umm, [gasps] yearbook! [finds Jim's picture] Ooooohhh no! You were so dorky! Good, it's good. Good work, everybody. I got sap on me. I'm a vegetarian. [singing] Here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I've ever known... Oh, yeah I gave that up. Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam? You wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please. [singing] Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly? Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside, there was something goin' on. This part goes to the, uh, girl. You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. In every b*at of my heart, we got something goin' on. Tender love is blind---Michael and We're making love!Michael and Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about. You get something good this year? Yeah? Who did you have? I think I got something pretty nice for my guy. I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow. Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond. Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim. That's from me. I don't know. It was so long ago. [opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome. I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap. One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift. I'll take the teapot. Damn it. Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But .. Sorry, I .. Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias. Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big h*t! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets. Cool, cool. Box it up. No trades. "A real man makes his own luck." Billy Zane.Titanic. No. I want it. I'm going to use it. .. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates] Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend. [laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot] I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so .. Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer? Hello. Jim? This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here? Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy. Okay, fine. Where's my wallet? But I don't have any... Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo. A ski mask and a swimsuit. A furnace? All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands! No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on! That's hilarious. Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you? It's getting kind of rowdy down there. Sometimes I just don't get Roy. I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader? Suppose your office building's on f*re. Jim, who would you save? Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her. Do you think that'll ever be us? What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight? Is somebody there? Captain Jack has a problem with authority. He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic. Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged. Roy said the first one didn't count. Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan... Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute. Well, if you like her so much, don't give up. BFD. Engaged ain't married. ...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long. But it's good. No, I want you to pick me up. Ok... I am hurt. I hurt my foot. [exasperated] OH GOD! Oh God! OK, buhhhh, I b*rned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work. I'm coming Michael! I don't have a girlfriend. It was all made up. Just someone come, ok? Anyone. Anyone but Dwight. What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window] Ohhhhhh! He h*t the pole! Oh my gosh. Is he ok? Please stop popping my cast. Thank you. Yep. Ugh, forget it. I'll just get up myself. No! Uh, aaaahhh! Ah! Oh God! No, he's actually been really nice and helpful. While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society. Well they notice it. Don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it? What's wrong with that guy? [hits his head on his desk] Uh, ugh, ohhhh... Oh, ok, that's, great. No, I can't drive. Jim why don't you drive. We'll go. I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please. Choo choo choo choo choo choo... Vietnam sounds. Tired... [Jim grabs spray bottle from planter] Want to take a rake... . Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight. Yeah. g*n! Oh, God, a mini-van. What is Meredith's problem? Where are we going? Where are we going? Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese. I found it under the seat. I'm thirsty. No! Give me the bottle!! Gimme the bottle, Dwight! Just give it! Stop, stop it! Stop spraying! [Dwight whines] Gimme the bottle! [sigh] Something with a "K". What do I write under "reason for visit"? Nothing. I wrote "bringing someone to the hospital". No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok? I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan. Really? Michael went in with him? Wow. Ok, that's uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go. Ok. Bye. Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me. What's up-dog? Good. How are you doing? Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time. It's much sexier. [Pam puts hair back up] [Michael walks by Jim] Man, this must be t*rture for you. Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant. Hey Jim-bag. Really? Who else knows? My lips are sealed. [singing] My lips are sealed... Bangles. Hey, whatcha gettin'? Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night? Any of em? So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the "P" situation? Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda? It's Grrrrrrape! Soda. Ok. So what is the secret Michael? Good. Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick. What are you doin' for lunch? Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat. Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room. Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who. We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers. I'm his boss actually. And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants. What do you like best about Pam? Is it her boobs, or... Really? Never get's any of my jokes. Her boobs, definitely. You put your front side in; you put your front side out. You put your front side in and shake it all about. You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around. That's what it's all about. Whoo, hoo! Woo! Yeah! What did you guys talk about? Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam? Hey. Did you find anything good in your desk? Score. Big day. Big day. Oh. Right. No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started. No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well. So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now? Mmm, hmm. Cool. Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake. I know, I know, I know. I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that [starts to get choked up] this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid. Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just. Yeah I'm good. Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out. [catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What? Oh, nothing. [again catching Jim looking at him] What? [while in his reeking office] I am a big Fear Factor fan. I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape. Um... [clearing throat] I can't stand it [gets up to leave], I can't stay in here another second. No! Thanks! A little. Good! What's goin' on here? [barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me. Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me. [sitting at Jim's desk] Hey Jim. I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet. Oh... It's ... [reluctantly] Yeah ... No, no, no! Seriously, I don't mind sharing. No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back. Are you moving back here? Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy. Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair. Oh my God, he is so cute! Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me? You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly. [phone rings, Phyllis reaches to answer] No. NO! [phone continues to ring] What's up? What? I don't know. Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool. Yeah, totally. Did she say something? Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out? Can you find out? Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends. Go get yourself a monkey kidney." You just asked a girl out on the phone! It's a terrible idea. [talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to b*at you up. Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam. No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right? You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home. So, we're cool, right? All right. Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation. No. Hey. How's it going down there? Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies. No. [laughs] Almost. Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great. Um... Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me. How did you know? Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons. Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway. What? You have something you want to say? Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices! Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name. What's this? What is this? Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose? The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and h*t some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. [Michael walks toward Sbarro.] Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome. And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like "Ryan, what's taking you so long?" And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say. So I said, "Ryan, what took you so long?" And I just said that to him, can you believe that? Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed. Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe. So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend. I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back, should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it. I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever. [to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or... It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together. Yeah, it would be so great if he was. Heading out? Have to think it through. Because if they say no... No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. [Michael starts playing with a football in the office] Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! [laughs] Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted. Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread? Do their pizzas play DVDs? Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so... Are you sad that Dwight b*at you? Oh. Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my... Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents? I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here. Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding? Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative. You should go to Hedonism. It's like Club Med, but everything is naked. [mimes lifting a glass] To Amsterdam. Umm... After my divorce. Yeah. Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me. Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates. Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager. Confidence, Dwight. I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone. Oh please! You're not taking any trip. You did? Yes. I am. Which is? You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point. Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini. I've got a time share in Key West that might be available. You really think you're going to go? Australia? I have always wanted to go there? That's awesome. Where are you staying? When are you leaving? Oh. Oh yeah. That's too bad. It's ok. I got it. I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel. Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys? I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one. From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. Yeah, but I've read it before. Definitely the Aquarium. Sure. Mmhmm! Yeah. Alright. All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga! [Sasha and Michael laugh] There is no way that hurt. Stop! Stop! Stop! [Ryan resumes the tape] Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow. He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone. Do you want to come over for dinner tonight? What're you doing? You never have plans. [singing] You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... [Dwight joins in] and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well... You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. [Jim and Dwight raise their hands] Alright. What's up? Thanks. They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion. Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, andhehad skin cancer too. When does he hear? ...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here? When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So...Thatwas the worst birthday I think I ever had. Sixty-nine cup of noodles. [whispering]No cookie. You use fabric softener? No, I do. [checking watch] We should probably head back. You dare me? How old are you? [over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner. Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls. Please, don't. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. No. [laughs] Who is that? Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it. Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go. Thanks, girl. I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't. I can't stop this investigation. It is my job. I volunteered for this job. It is my duty... Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where's my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest! No, it's marijuana. That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me. I would remember. That's not how it works. Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you. So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it. Is that supposed to be me? Hmmmpt.Pam/ Jinx! Buy me a coke. Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx. Sorry, that's not my problem. [placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim. Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar. He gives the coke back to Pam] Hey. Oh, God. 'Cause I'm in a band. We really rock. [crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes? What?! That is not true. Redact it. Redact it! I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby. Don't take her side. I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff. Yeah. I accept your decision! That doesn't make any sense. I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life. This is humongous. I am not a security thr*at... And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'. Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] "Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert." [flips to another paper] "Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to." [reading] "This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed m*rder. I think he may be the real m*rder." [flips to another paper] "Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can." Gah. "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone." [reading] "Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'." "By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier." The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful. It's a good market. Higher volume. I have a girlfriend... What? [looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date. What?! I'm the one who complained about you. [off camera] Okay, good. Check that out. [off camera] That's terrible. But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems. Okay, Jan will see you now. Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, "Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening." Makes you feel good. Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance. Oh, really? Mmm-hmm. How would you do that? [laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious? I don't believe you. Continue. [scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead. So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief. Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with A*DS. Who has A*DS? There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, A*DS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. "I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head." [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious A*DS joke. It's one of my dreams. Oh, nothing. They're wedding bands. Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now. There's a KISS cover band in here. I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work. Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too. I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza. Have three stages, yeah. Oh. Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums. On the drums! On the drums! We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band. Oh, my... No! No! No, come back! No, no, no! I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs. [coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks. Give me the dice! "Yeah, right," what? [Laughs] I have good cards. Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in. Straight. Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen. One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can. Smoke? Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here. Why did I hook up with Michael? It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer? Good. Have you told anyone? If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right? Bye! Hey. Good, especially after I took all your money in poker. About when you want to give me more of your money? Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight. What? What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that? Well, I um... I... I can't. You have no idea... ...what your friendship means to me. I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault. Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore. I got Jim's uh, old job. Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it willnotsay "Ryan Howard is a temp." It will say "Ryan Howard is a junior sales associate at a mid-range paper supply firm. ...that'll show 'em. Me too. ...I think we're just drunk. No... [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim--- No, I'm not gay. And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay. I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable. Hey, Big Tuna! You're single right? She's pretty hot huh? [Jim nods] She's completely crazy. Steer clear Big Tuna. Head for open waters. OooOK. So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch. And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber. Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them. Definitely. Damn. [thinks] I'll try Brookstone. I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better f*re in Connecticut. Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet? Shut up. That's impossible. Well, I did it too. So what kind of commissions you get up there? Hey hey! Yeah. A sh*t of MIDORI, perhaps. Um, we should... All right. Business has been pretty crazy around the office. Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk. I will call him later with that message. Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left? Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically. Hey hey, fellers. Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me. D? I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know. People have been filtering in and out. What? Sure. You like Cosmos? Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy? I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just... I'm not better than Josh. Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her. Yeah. I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling. Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out. Evan, this is Jim. Do you guys work together? I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits. But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair. Why did you do that?! We're on the German team. sh**t the Brittish. Isn't that like your third soda today? It's the new guy. [looks at Jim] We just need a strategy, ok? We're going to set up a trap in the g*n room. All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44? [whispering] Look how cute he is! He's trying to sh**t with a smoke grenade. I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around. Just tap S then D. [her players g*n is pointed directly at Jim's player's head] Any... last words? No? What? [Karen's player sh**t Jim's player, "You k*lled Jim Halpert" appears on the screen, Karen giggles] Hug it out, b*tch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate. Okay, just get it done. Jim, will you make sure? [at vending machine] Dammit. Uh, nothing. They're just out of Herr's chips. But don't worry about it. My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority. That's perfect. Okay, great. I think that's enough. Can I get back to work now? I am NOT a quitter. I will do this all day if you want. Hey. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in. Oh, the vending machines! How did we miss that? Mm. [laughs] Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you? Yeah. I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal. [on phone] Bonjour. Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's. Non? Ah... merci quand meme. Au revoir. [spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them? Where'd I find what? [squeaky chair] Hey. My chair is squeaking. You took my chair. When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so... Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second. [rocks in squeaky chair] stop. This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please. This is not a proportionate response. [phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Oh my God. Hi. Oh. I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day. Yeah, totally. So... Do you... Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here. A little different. What time is it there? Oh, yeah. Right. I don't know. It felt far. What? I type 90. It's true. 70? How many do you type? Come on. Tell me. You have to tell me now. No, it's, that's respectable. So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself... Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home... And, I'm freaking out. That movie is so scary! But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up. Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box. Would I make that up? Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet. I have one kitchen. It's actually... Three kitchens? [Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok? Yeah. Yeah. Um. Ok, bye. No, I was um... You have to go? No, I should probably go too. I mean, yeah. All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'. Sorry. Nice basket. We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I. Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane. From 'Cheers'. Got it. You guys ready to party? Hey, Big Tuna, you ready? One. Two. Three. sh*t! Oh, that burns! Golly. Um... One. Two. Three. sh*t! [sings] I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.Andy and Wait, wait.Andy and Oh, come on, guys. Please.Andy and It's not good.Andy and Goodnight, guys. No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin. Okay. Hey dummy, get in the car! Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car. Yeah, you can't. Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay? Hey. Who are you faxing so early in the morning? Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain. Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head] Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing? [Karen nods and Andy looks at Jim] In your face! [surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut! But when I do, we'll have something to talk about. Sure, what's up? I honestly don't. I don't know. You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it. I'm gonna make some calls. So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford. And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch. Yeah. Michael. Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay. What you gonna do? You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job. Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would. Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay. Okay, yeah. Maybe I will. [to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out... [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott. So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines? Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you. This is going to be an adventure. ...which is why they need a passing game. [to Jim] No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man. Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not... so, your desk is... Oh my god! It's really you! I know. I don't care. It's really good to see you. You, too. Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford. Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me. What are you doing? I have a smudge on my forehead? Why are you looking at my forehead? Meet my eye line, Jim! Stop acting like an idiot! Hey, buddy. Welcome back. I'm good! How are you? So... Yeah. Um... unless you really, really want it back. Cool, thank you. Yuh. Congratulations. Hey, Jim! Oh, really good. How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump] No, I'm sorry, it's... No, it's nothing. We'll just... [shakes hand] So... okay. All right... sorry... sorry about that. It was just... Jim! Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you! Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing! Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please. But check that it's covered by your health care provider! [recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message. [recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message. [recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza. Mm-hm. Hey. What happened to grape soda? Oh. You've changed so much. So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work? Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever. Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I... All right. Okay. Yeah. I know, me too. Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration? If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise. Shut it! That's... [whispers to camera] suck up! [off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy. Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink. Yeah. Ok. Hey! Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do. What's up? What do you mean? Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want. We're friends. We'll always be friends. It's good to have you back. Hey. ...Almost done? Just about... yup. Now. Good. All right. [everyone leaves] [over phone] I am so horny. Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack. Oh, and I care why? Next. How about... [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that. Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it? All... righty, let's get started. What is she into? I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates... Are you kidding? I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf. ...Danny Glover. [Jim raises hand] Yeah. Who? Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up? These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole. Yeah. I play the banjo. [singing] You know I can, my man. Hey. I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car. What is going on? I love it. I want in. Who's the target? Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment. Michael, please. [Michael makes kissing noises] Internet. And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office. I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom. And I nevah got caught, neither. Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room] Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen? Jim. What does it look like? And circle gets the square. He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease. OK... Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks. Well, that is probably from the test drive. This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. [singing] I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um, taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah. And a happy holiday to you. I don't understand? Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you. For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim] They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell. So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn't wrap it. Oh. Oh yeah. No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.] Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances. I didn't see where it was. Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth. OK, this is stupid. No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee. C'mon Jim, let's go. So she looks at me right, and she goes, "I'm sorry, don't I even know you?" After a year, ayearof buying lattes from her, do you believe that? Excuse me [tries to take away meat with chopsticks] Ah, un guard. [Fights with chopsticks and laughs] Family style. Jim! Jim! What... What's happening? Oh... Narcolepsy. Oh my gosh, now she's up. Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the Kn*fe below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers. OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. [Guys walk in with two different waitresses from Benihana's] [singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know. No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones' Diary movie DVD] And now we get to remember it forever. That waitress was the one. How can you be sure? Don't make fun... You're making fun of me. I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm. I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike! Oh, why do I feel like crap? I had rebound? Yeah. Night. We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier. It costs seventy five dollars. Tape recorder. For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts. Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment. What? I'm not. I do not have a Kn*fe! [leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar! Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo? You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon. The Jamaicans don't have a word for "impossible." Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken] Already sent it to you my friend. Hey. You OK? You sure? Oh. You want to talk about it? OK, I accept it. Hmm. How far away does she live now, like ten minutes? No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah. Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan! No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe... Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot [playing conch shell] You sure? Hi, Jim. Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him. You know what? Get Pam. Pam, you look very hot today. Long time. Me lobe yoy long time. I would love to meet Long Tim. You ruined a funny joke, you. Get out of my offive. Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade? Yup. I'll trade. Let's go get a broom. Leave the keys. [Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting. No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten att*cks are from the rear. Oh... Thanks. [On Phone] One... Three... Seven... Sure. Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time. Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly. All right, I get it. We got a deal. I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent. My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys. Hey, do you want to grab a coffee? Yeah.[ Newpeat Quote ] No, thanks. I had some already. Oh, but, hey, Jim. I won an art contest today. Thanks. I sent in one of my watercolors. It was the new one I did. You ready Jim? Yeah. Thanks. So, let me ask you a question. Did you ever have a thing for Pam? I moved here from Connecticut... One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered. [to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays "Rockin' Robin"] All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever. Thank you muchly. [cellphone continues playing] I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring. Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you. I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience. So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna... I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. [fake casts off] Whizzzzz. [catches Jim] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. [Jim gets up] Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh! Hey. Yeah, you should not encourage him. Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't. 185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! ["displays" Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed] What? Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago. [singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed. Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please. [after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one. Nope. Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device? What's going on? Where is my FREAKING phone?! Maybe you're in the ceiling! We can talk about that. [Dwight high fives Michael] All right. I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker] Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much. [sighs] Do you still have feelings for her? Hello everyone! As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding. [Applause] So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did. And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one. This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever. It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta. I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever. Hey. Ugh. Everything okay? Well you seem a little tired. You should get more sleep. Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference. Oh yeah. Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping. Better than not. Okay. We are off. Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers. Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats. No, TATS. Of course I want- Leave me alone and get the male stripper. I knew you would, Nancy. No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette? [Pokes Ryan with a sex toy.] Gotcha, oh! [Phone rings.] Yes? I'm in the, I'm in the sex shop. Squarepants? And you think that'd be sexy? Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them. Especially that one. [Points to Phyllis] Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases. Hey. Oh, okay good. Well in the future please identify yourself as such. I do! I want some man meat! Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin? Pam. What do you think? In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment. Okay. [Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs] I... Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'. The Shrutes have their own traditions. We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair. Yeah. P and R? Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people? No way. I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear att*cks, they come when you least expect it. Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you! Hey! Oh... I'm pacing myself. No. I'm such a dorky dancer. I know. It's very cute. [to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here? You too. Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop! At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership. What? What's so wierd? [sighs] This is your job, Halpert. Oh, what happened? But Jim, this garlic bread is cold. Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted. What glare? Good night, Mary Beth! Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six. No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE! Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm. Jimbo, last chance to carpool. Sure? Might be a good idea. Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip. Play some games? I spy? Yeah. Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall? That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date. And it didn't end well. [tests smoke detector] Good. Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated. Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable. Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo. God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and sh**t some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes. Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me. I so got you. Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first. Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun. What's ah, what's with Jan and Michael? So do you want to see it or not? Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic. Yeah. Yeah! You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend. Later, Jim. Bye. Ok, so this is what's gonna happen. You're gonna suck it up. ...and we're gonna go to dinner. And then we're gonna go to the movies. Hey Halpert! I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened. Itsucked. I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars. Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded. Don't want it. Don't want it. Won't open it. Don't need it. Won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens. Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you. Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise. Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think... [mumbling softly] that maybe you should... [mumbling jibberish] What I'm saying is that, [continues to mumble jibberish] Ok, see what I did? By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position. Ok, let's try another one. Um... Walking out of the room unexpectedly. It's a surprise. Go ahead, ask me for a raise. [gets up and begins to walk out of the room] What? No, what did you say? Would you stop it, please? Sorry I almost got you k*lled. He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what was I thinking, right? Not anymore. It's, um... It's completely over now. Jim... I am really... sorry. A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks. It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that. When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and sh**t down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer? No. And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle? Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks. [as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out! What's this? Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department. "Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man. Dwight K. Schrute" Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look. There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap. Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees] Mornin' Jim. Good. Drew. Dr--- You can call me Drew. Cool. I can't control what you do. I can only control whatIdo. Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned. Ok, tell him that's not true. Ok, no. Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim! Tell him! Five bucks says it's over 50. How many? [in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful... On what? Really, ten? That's your guess? You're a professional accountant. Forty-two. Fifty-one. Ten... That is not fair. He has spent hours up here at reception with you.Hoursandhours. No, constantly. Like, foryears. What are the odds that this is in any way real? Dwight, you ignorant slut. And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof! [zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there. Oh... God. Oh my God, he's gonna jump. Yeah... Okay, uh... I don't see anything. She might be bluffing. That's a ridiculous question. Well that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought--- Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?! You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk] Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year! [on phone] Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations? Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions? Jim, big f*re in your house. Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids. No, no, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school. In person. [English accent] William Dolittle at your service. A.K.A., Will Do. I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology. The press wants a story, I will give them a story. Beer me! Hand me that water. I always say "Beer me." Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's-her-name? Who, Karen? Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends. [takes swig of water] Mmm. How's the apartment hangin'? Nice. Check out this sunshine, man. Global warming, right? Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet. Uh, yeah. Should have said so. [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah! Give me the b*at, boys, and free my soul. I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay. Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the b*at, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa-- Your call, dude. My girlfriend made an awesome mix. Beer me that disc. So, Tuna. When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay? Whoa! What the--- Why is my girlfriend here? No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef. The one in the green hoodie. I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something? She's like, probably a tutor. She probably a t-- Sh--- [shuts door on him] Great. Jamie! OH MY GOD! I had no idea. I'll be with you in a moment. Who was that guy she was talking to? At her locker. But whowasthat guy? The issue with the watermark is very serious. We teach our students that character counts. [scoffs] Pfft. You don't teach it well enough. One of your students is ab*tch. I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook. A full page, two words--- I feel terrible about Debbie Brown. She got fired because of Dwight. So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times. Why do bad things always happen to the good people? It's tragic. Just tragic. I don't care. Yeah. You know what--- I don't--- [Joins in with classic Andy falsetto] Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube! Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube! Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend? No. I'm good. Thanks. I'm Jim Halpert. [more horrible "Jim faces"] [to Pam] Hey. That is a demerit. You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law. [scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those. Three demerits and you'll receive a citation. Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior. That is correct. What's a dis... what's that? [jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move! What happened? What can I do to help? I'll check the web. [laughing softly] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it. Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force. No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation. You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a h*m*. Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom? You aren't curious? Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy. [quietly] Yeah. I'm going in. [marks Scranton with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what weknow. Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight? What's the occasion? Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up. Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um - [tires screeching] Crap. [phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute. Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy. Ugh. I'm hanging up. You have information about the sex predator? Where? We will be called Gryffindor. Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim. He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that. I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone] Hole? I am trying to bring team spirit. I can't say. [growly noises, Jim looks terrified] [to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight. Yeah. No. Good. Please just check. Hello? Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well. As well. Yes. uh, huh. That would be fine. [whispering] Cut it out! Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up. Ji.. why not? C'mon. You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager. Because I already did. Remember? I b*rned my foot on a George Foreman grill. Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got. You are being too modest. [Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey. What's different about you? You look worse. You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot. Turn around. Yes. Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut. What is it, Big Haircut? Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut. What? Hey. I think it looks great. Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit. Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it. [looks annoyed] No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger... Moon each other. All right. So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen? Pam is taller. Yes. She has bigger breasts, too. I think Karen has a prettier face. Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call. Yeah. Will do. [squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never. No. And the sheets are made of f*re. Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town. I'll have to talk to the manager. I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan! Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet. Oh my God. [mouths to Jim]Huge! [whispers] That's crazy! [moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God. Can you believe that? Wow! [to Jim] Good luck. [Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview. Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house. No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me. So we have all night. Where do you want to go first? How often do you come here? [Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work? So what's going to happen to us when I get this job? Well,ifyou get the job then I'd move here with you. Would you move with me? I'm not stupid. I was at the beach. We won't have a future in Scranton. There's one too many people there. Exactly. But you get it, right? Can't stay there. I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me. Thatis Beardy. Mm-hmm. Wow. That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction. Don't! She's nuts! [they laugh] Okay, good! Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch. And, I was gonna meet them, so... Just call me when you're done. Good luck, Halpert. I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan. Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim. You're clearly a very bright guy. Always h*t your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet--- Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers? And that, uh, questionnaire. Sorry to make you fill that thing out... ...that's a HR formality. We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like. [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads "Jim, Don't forget us when you're famous! Pam" It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall. Ugh. So, first up... How do you think you function here in New York? You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place? Okay. Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul. So... long haul. Where do you see yourself in ten years? Medium rare. Thanks. [they laugh] I know. I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job. I mean, why wouldn't he? He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK. We're friends. And I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just, we never got the timing right. You know? I sh*t him down, and then he did the same to me, and... But you know what? It's OK. I'm totally fine. Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in] Yes.
