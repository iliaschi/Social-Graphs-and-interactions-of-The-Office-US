I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam? If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [growls] Any messages? Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate. Really? I didn't... [looks at Pam] Did we get a fax this morning? Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it? Yeah, it'll be you. Yes? Hey. Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! [hold hand up for a high five] Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm h*tler. Adolf h*tler. [Continues with cod German] I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good. Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on. Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. [Imitating Six-Million Dollar Man sound effect] Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise. I'm sorry? I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then. If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry. He put my stuff in Jell-O again. Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink? That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink. Tonight, hopefully. Hey, baby. Hey. Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring. No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home. Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to... Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first. Why? Well, theft and stealing. Post-it Notes. 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam. Yeah. I am. [Pam starts crying] You been X'd punk! [Laughing] Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you. What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, "Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked. How are things? Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache? Good. Good. Yeah? Am I walking out? Yes, I... Do you want to... [Car horn honking] Oh, Roy. Solitaire? Six on seven. So then, why didn't you do it? Oh this is a good one. Fine. How are you? I admire your culture's success in America. Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan. OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick. Pam, come on. "I like your food." Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real. [Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey. Hey. We can go. Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies. Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway. Lay them on me. What? That's not what you said earlier. Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it? Interesting, what's that like? Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is... There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible. [on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks? Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there? Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call. I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce? Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this. Still no one calling. I thought it was a workspace? Yes. And my decision in final. I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will. Ah, what? Which memo? It's like a pay decrease. You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise. Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both. Oh, great. I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion. k*ller nanorobots? OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert. Jim! Open the door! Jim! No, not at all. Jim! Oh yeah? Jim! OK, the health care plan. Who is it? Who's the birthday? Next person on the... ...calendar. Yes! All right, come on down Meredith! Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise. Well, there's green, um, blue... yellow... red... I think green is kind of whoreish. She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so... There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone. Oh yeah. Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so... Sure, what's up? Oh no? No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me. You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd k*ll myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good. Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic. Son of a b*tch. That is impressive. OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box. But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover. No, no, dude, no. No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa. God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um... Keep me out of it. You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job! Rapport! [hits Pam in the head with a piece of paper] Off the backboard! Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once? Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a h*m* way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying. You coming down? You gonna wish me luck? Is that trash talk from Pam? Oh. Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along. Who's got Roy? [Jim does a behind the back move around Roy for the basket] [to Pam] ...so I talked to the scout, it looks good. Hey baby. [to Jim] Look at Larry Bird. Larry Legend. Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That's just stupid. Pam! Burger with cheese! And fries! And shake! What? Go ahead. No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction. Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away. Wow, thanks. So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around? She's prettier than you though. I know, it's unbelievable. [Katy walks through breakroom] Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam. Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good. [mimicing Dwight in high-falsetto voice] Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta? Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens. Oh! That was really. [Dwight hits purse against table] This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all. I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball. Oh, how much? [gives Dwight a thumbs-up - mouths the word] Good. He did pick a good one. This one's really good for a hot date. [laughs] Congratulations. You need a hot date more than anyone. Did we get any mail? Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and... A futon? What's up? Are you still mad at me? Come on [begins to tickle Pam] Come on, you mad at me? Are you still mad at me now? Are you mad at me now? Huh? huh? Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding. I was just kidding. You know I didn't mean it. I can't... What's up? Thank you for choosing me. Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy. Yeah. Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos. And stuff... yeah. What are you doing? Okay. That's cool. That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right? Okay. So, you ready for the... the Dundies? Ugh... [in video] To Oscar Martinez it's the "Show Me the Money" award! Yeah! [in video]...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere... Live and learn. So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either. So who are we laughing at? What is it? Who wrote it? That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less. Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom. Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to... Yes. Yeah, let's get out of here. Um, guys, where you going? Pam, show's just getting started. Well, we'll fix it up. You don't have to display that.[Pam and Roy are at the truck, arguing.] ...talking about? He's a jackass every year. [Put's his hand on Pam's arm] Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's. Pam. Go. Hey! How are ya? I thought you left? Oh! Oh. Right? You know wat I'm talking 'bout. [Pam starts sipping an empty glass] I think those might be empty. [give Kevin his award]There you go. [starts clapping] Yeah, alright Kev.[More people start clapping] Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going. [getting his spirit back] Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we'll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year. You know you did. Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen! [Pam grabs the microphone from him] Oh, here we go. I have so many people to thank for this award.[Quick cut to Jim laughing and staring at Pam with amused wonder] Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them. [people clap] Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because [people start clapping again] this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.[Dwight stands up, but nobody claps] Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.[Quick cut to Jim, he's doesn't know whether to laugh or take her seriously, so he gives her an amused/appreciative grin] What? Okay. It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.[Dwight starts taking off his shirt, but gets stuck] Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I k*lled, almost. Whoa. Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work. Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there. sh**t.[Pam stares at Jim for a little while, then glances at the camera, realizes she's on camera] Alright. I'm really excited to meet your Mom. You are? My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in. Oh yeah? Good. Cause I have a lot of questions. So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam? MILF! Thanks, Kevin. Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke. Great point. That's what she said. Pam? Don't ever let this little b*tch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour. Um... hello. Finally made it! Hello! This is all yours? So a guy goes home, tells his wife, "Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery." She goes, "Oh my god! That's incredible! Where are we going?" He goes, "I don't know where you're going, just be out of here by five!" [men laugh] Boom! Oh, right! I remember... with the picture. Sure. [to Roy] Oooooh! Oh, thank you! So! We ready for dinner? So which one is Jim? I just wanted to know. All right. Okay. Okay. Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to. [looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk] [laughs] Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him. Mm-hmm. No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh. Wind. Perfect. [misses] Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies. We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day. Very good. We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines? Good. The Small Business Man? Maxim? American Way? Cracked? How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly? NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked. Thank you. Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids. You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam? Hum. Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton. Here we go. Here we go. Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis! Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton. Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires. I'm sure. I have one, yes. I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you. Ryan Howard. Ryan! [claps] Gold medal. What? [looks in box] Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that? Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work! Hey. Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead? Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies. Notify the athletes. Jim Halpert. What? How did you get this number? Stalker. So we're still on for lunch? You're meeting me here? Okay. Great. Bye. And, um... Wow. Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... . Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable. Unforgivable. Pam? Get us back into it. Five movies. Go ahead. Ooh, definitely in my top five. What? Okay that's five. Pam, play by the rules. Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore. He doesn't even know that I do that. Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the w*r goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted. Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time. Nothing. How about you Pam? Yeah, I like Oscar. Okay, um, first, Legally Blond. Happy Halloween, everyone! [notices Pam, in her cat costume] Oh... that's great! I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about. Yes. Yes. Yeeesh. Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do. Because it's very scary stuff. You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here. No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be? And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail. I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. [bobs his head around, causing the costume head to jiggle around] Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing] Okay, okay... Nice. Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India. Those aren't chips and dip. Uh! I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things. And I made cookies. Same category. I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts. [on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.] Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real. Um... it's in Maryland. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away] Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off.[sits back down in his chair and waves Jim off.] Just, just... yeah. It wasn't me. [watching nearly everyone leave] What about the Halloween party? I don't want to stay until seven again this year. I don't really have any control over that Stanley. [to Pam] Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin. Yes, thank you. I know where to sign. Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam? Updating emergency contacts. Calling from... [Ryan hangs up] You making this up as you go along, aren't you? Well, at least I don't have cavities. And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man. Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael. Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips. Obviously. [Pam knocks on his door] Go away. I haven't signed them, ok? Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough. Oh, I could b*at up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could m*rder him. Oh, so that's what they are saying? [Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting. Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything. [Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok. [Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up. What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now. Later, Kev. [Puts French Onion Potato Chips on Pam's desk] Have a good weekend. Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby. Good. Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans? Michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens. But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that's why he started casual Fridays. That is unbelievable. We are doing worst first dates. Ok, that's a joke. Wait, when was this? Just one joke. Ok. Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke. Umm... let's see... choo choo choo. Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me. Yes. No. Nope. Told it. Not as good as you think. Pick another one. Oh ho ho, yea! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning? Is this real? [Pam dumps Michael's screenplay on Jim's desk] Agent Michael Scarn. How long is this? [flips through pages] Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop. Drawings. Thank you for noticing. Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy] Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever. And you're disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who's Dwigt? That's actually a good idea. We'll all take a brief intermission. [To Pam] Hey, are you hungry? [Pam lights a candle] Wow. Nice. That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich. So, I guess I'll see you in [looks at watch] ten hours. Travel. I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be... really nice. Gonna find myself. Jan didn't come back for her car last night. Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta? No way. Some might even say that we had our first date last night. Really. Cause there was dinner, by candlelight. Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. [Pam nods reluctantly] And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date. You're right, we didn't dance. It was more like, swaying. But still romantic. Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game. Pam, could I see you in my office? Pam, you're trustworthy- And a woman- And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. [Jan on recording] "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews. I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon." First impressions? [playing Jan's message] "I guess I missed you." I guess I missed you. So, she misses me? But then she goes on to say "that will be our only topic of discussion". That doesn't mean anything, those are just words. Ok. Yeah, what, what? Ohhh, great. Well, now I'm in a terrible mood. Let's do your performance review- Ah, why, that's great news? That, that, then why would, why would I not like that? It's all about my bonus. Ohh... Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday. So, keep that goin'. I actually look forward to performance reviews. I did the youth beauty pageant circuit. And I enjoyed that quite a bit. I really enjoy being judged. I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny. Yeah? Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do. I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas. Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down? In a folder? A "Michael-idea" folder? That's unfortunate. How 'bout the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there. The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously? Maybe there's prizes? [on phone] We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. [to Pam] Could you please tell Michael that I'm here? Please don't smell me, Michael. Hey, how's it goin'? Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it? Who? Who was it? Who did he f*re? I don't understand- [phone rings] Hold on. Sorry. [answers] Yes, Pam. I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt. No, it's in like ten minutes. Smallville. And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise. I don't really wanna picture it. But thank you, Pam. Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know. Especially working together. Oh- Never missed a day, my ass. Good. [Pam overhears] What? Hmm... No. [humming] Uhhh, ew, ew, ew... .Maybe? It's like squishing a spider under a book. It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead. Sooo... [to camera guys] If you guys see anything... ? Nice. Does he have access to their medical records? Meredith has an E-vite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my e-vitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be... .[scrolls down list] No. Hi. It's ok. No. Are we supposed to? Hmm... [Pam reaches towards vending machine] Excuse me. That's pretty young. Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody'd go. The athletes, the, the nerds, professors. It's true. I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael. So three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up. [sighs] He is very real. So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael. I know. [laughs] Oh man. Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff. So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or... Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport? Great. [to a group of guests] Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised- Hey! Just in time! You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave. Yeeehh, ok. See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour. It's- This is my desk. My home office, this is it. Ok, sure. Will do. Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right. You know what? Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place. Happy thoughts, Pam. Happy thoughts. Yeah, you don't have to, ummm. Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all. Oh yeah. I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears] Sure. You tell me. Well, you do mean you and Jim right? Oh God. I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time. I'm sorry! Oh by the way how's your side project going? Really? Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws. I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive. I'm sorry, everybody. Pam. I thought that was called Nasty Christmas. Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now. Pam, steal something or pick the final gift. Sure you don't want the teapot? Right. [after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about? You got a bonus check? This is awesome. Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money. You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know. But .. Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside. [opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture! Yeah, I think I made the right choice. Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is. No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup. Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me. Ah! Ha ha ha! "It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask." So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers. Yeesh, how old is this ship? Titanic? Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on! That's what I'm talking about! I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his sh*t. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl! Well... Oh, um... [A long silence.] I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off? Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin! Then I'll give you away! [off camera] Yeah, that's right. Pam! It's Michael. Help me! I need help right now. I'm hurt, I have hurt myself. Oh my God! Ungh, this is not looking good Pam! What? What's going on? I'm sorry? Pam. Pam, could you come get me?! [silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on? I don't want Dwight! [sounds of a car crash] What was that... Oh! It's broken right, he can't... Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield] Ohhhhhh!Jim and Oh my God! Morning everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through. Did you explain why? Thank you. Pam, messages please? Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and... Sorry. I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask. Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport? Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid. Oh, no no no. Don't go there. I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece. Yeah, I'll write down the address for you. Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding! Why would they all be...? Ok, see you later, Pan. Pam... PAAAM!? Oh, God. Come here please. I want you to rub butter on my foot. Pam, please? I have Country Crock. These covers are totally indestructible. Oh no, it's broken. No, it's fine. I told you it wouldn't break. You could throw it all day long. So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now. Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today? And that isn't weird? First is parking. You can't block the freight entrance with your car, even if your blinkers are on. Does anybody have any questions? [to Dwight, whose arms is raised] Yes. Yeah? yes... Ahh! Ok, Pam, thanks. You're the best. It smells like chicken soup. I have to go to the hospital. Where we going? I'll be back, I mean... Why? Aw, Pam, you're adorable [taps her nose] [giggles] Fine. Fine. Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim. Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan. Michael went in there with him too. It's pretty sweet. Uh huh. But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon. Ok. Bye. What's up, Pam? Ok... Not much what's up with you? Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs. Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid? Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair? Who took all the black ones? So, how did Oscar sound when he called in? Sniffling how? Three. Ok, good, thank you. That wasn't so hard now was it? Hilarious. Hey. [Holds up Hooters t-shirt] Just you know politics, literature. Nice... she issohot. Hey. Ah, coupon for a free sandwich. It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago. Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here. Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael. And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean. Oh you did? No, no, you saw through me, great. Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay. And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it. Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing. Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim. No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend. It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise. Ready? Spamster! Hamster. Welcome back! How was your vacation? Yeah? Did you get lucky? Oh! Boink! I am Pam. Spicoli guy. Oh, God. Names, numbers. Okay. [walking into office] Whoa! God! Yuck, yuck. Yuck. Yuck! Wow! What happened in there? There is stink in there, my God! What is... what is that? Is it a bird? [pounding on door] Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here. I can't hold my breath that long. Hey! Welcome back! So, how was the resort? Did you ski a lot? [smelling the stink] Oh. Wow. Watch out, Pam. You're next! [on phone, whispering] Am I the 107th caller? We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe. Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something. 30. Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that. [snaps] You know what? Today is not a good day for a sales contest. We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today. Well I hated it! A lot! Okay, I... you know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done . [no one comes forward] Very well. Then you are all punished. You have seven unheard messages. [voicemail message for Jim] Hey, Jim. It's Pam. I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible. Anyway, I'm bored. Come back! [voicemail message for Jim] Hey, guess what? I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head. It's working. I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator. [voicemail message for Jim] Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert. [voicemail message for Jim] I'll transfer you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry. Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you. [voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe? Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe. [voicemail message for Jim] Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow. So, I'm happy to be here. It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well. Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize. Yes, Pam? I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then? Really? I thought they were pretty... Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream? She's real good. You know the company is offering a design training program in New York. Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out. [in the background] He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term... Hey! It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls? Did you really? Oh. Good. Nice. Well, what's it all about? I think you should do it. That's great! Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that [snaps her fingers]. They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael. So you're not doing it. Why not? Come on. Roy said that. You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always? You are? Yeah. Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting. I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and... Would you sign here? [Phyllis gets up from desk and walks over.] Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything? Woah. [Delivery man with flowers] Really, Oh, they're from Bob again. Phyllis Lapin. Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately? No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room] [same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of... (smirking) Exactly. You mean, like a ham? Ok, I get it. [with flowers] Can you sign? Yeah. Nothing for me? Hey babe. You almost ready to go? What's wrong? What, you're mad at me? Good. [Michael leaves office] Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day. Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.] What did I do to deserve this? No. Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures? Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later. Ok, cool. Insult. Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured. As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice. [speaking to camera] You saw the plaque, right? [to office] All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking. Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast. Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception? You're inviting Jim? I always set it at 69. [snickers] Oh. [shouts] Together that we prevail! [cheering and clapping] I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable. I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but... I'm... leaving on June 8th. Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just... Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out? Bribery. Nice. Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w--- ... Oh, God is that today? Well, I'll be in my office. They're cool. [on phone] Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. [Sasha walks in the door] ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different. [Sasha walks out] Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow. No thanks. Uhh, I don't know. ...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye. [wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on! Who? Terry? Is it okay if I take one? Thank you. Is your job hard? Yeah! Yeah. That's so cool, yeah! That's so awesome! Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play? [singing] ...did slowly go by... and feed... them on your dreams... Alright, let me explain. Again. [draws on board] Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's... [Jim draws a triangle around Michael's diagram] ... I have to go make a call. Oh ho ho! What? When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty? Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam] [answering phone] Yeah? [laughing] Okay. I'm so nervous. You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this [points to James Dean poster]. Sometime today. Ohh... poor Kevin. Creed! Come on. Stanley! So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back. Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number. [puts fabric softener into cart] ...What? Yeah, you don't? ... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door]. Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement. Just... quit stalling. Such a dork. Ma'am? Please don't touch that. That is not a toy. How old are you? Think you can let go? YEAH! Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids. Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks. Yeah. Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it. [mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip. I do not think that is funny. [in unison] I do not think that is funny. Oh... No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke. Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid. [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out] [mouths] C'mon! So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of... We're having the best conversation. [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no] Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam. Really? [Jim shakes his head no] Jim it's okay. You can t... [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths "I can't" and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well. My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out. I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today. Hi. How much time do you have left on your break? So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet? Oh I got the 'Save The Date'. Yeah, pretty stationery. I didn't get mine yet. Uh... Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win. How 'bout, she takes it down? Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win. [claps his hands twice] It is done! Great. [gets up and leaves] [looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist. Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago? All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next. Uh... [reading]"Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?" [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right? Stanley. [off camera] I didn't do it! [Michael and Stanley continue to talk off camera, but it's inaudible] [sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again] Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends. [sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything? You mean your thoughts and feelings? What? No, Pam. Pam, it wasn't her. And I took it right back. It was like... I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years. So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame. Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people. That's a dog. What are you doing? "Till Death Do Us Rock." Oh. Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams. Let's do it. [Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good. Yes. Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity. Let's take a look. Nice. What? Wow. Oh! Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna... No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding. Kev! Who? Do I know a Carol Stills? Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is itrealgood? It's still me. Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt. Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes? Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume? Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody. Yeah, right. What was this? [Makes face] Really? Yeah, I think she's full of it. Sorry, babe. I am just b*at. Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right? See you. Hey, how's it going? Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something? No, I... I was just... I'm in love with you. I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just... I just needed you to know. Once. Yeah. Don't do that. Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna bemorethan that. Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good. [after "the kiss"] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that. No I'm not drunk. Are you drunk? Chicken or fish? So you havin' a good day? Good, glad. OK. Trick question! Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know. Is that the right answer? Pam? Did you see Oprah yesterday? I, uh... I am going to be a father. Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost. I know. Well... Just do it, okay? Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay? Eight months? I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months. You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby... Twenty years. Thirty. Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing? You look so pretty. Thank you. Yeah, do it! unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim? Alan's cartoon is so funny, right? Hey, Pam. It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted... Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird. You love ketchup! He loves ketchup. Well, I just, uh... I kinda think about stuff that I see, or dream them. See, this one is great, because it can work on a couple of different levels. [French accent] Freedom fries for the table. Yeah. I mean, people always say, like, "Don't be edgy." But I don't know any other way. Yeah, you get it. Yeah. Next time bring some of your illustrations, I'll let you pick my brain. Yeah. Okay. Alright, everybody here? Yes. Yes pleeeeease! Thank yooouuu! [with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else? Nooo. At the Stamford branch, they all play this World w*r II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it. I'm told it started as a team building exercise. Unfortunately I really suck at it. We didn't play many video games in Scranton. Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus. [on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear] Kelly really likes to online shop. Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes. [gasps] I love it! You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on. Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! It's really something. What? [walking into the break room] Hey. You look nice. I... won't. I won't. Wow. Psychopath. [Karen grins widely at Jim] I'm just looking. In a minute. There you go, fresh from the warehouse. There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam. I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained. So did you hear the news? Yeah. Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really? It's... pssssh... . He was almost 70. Circle of life. [holds out arms to Pam] Yeah. Mmmmmm. [as they leave] There's nothing wrong with your car. I just thought you might like a break from the "grief counseling" session. How are you likin' the new car? Yeah? Sure is small. Got airbags? [as Pam returns to conference room] Okay, we can start. Um... Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam. I need a box. I need a box. A small box... not too confining. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Yes, please. Excellent. Always. [runs off] Dwight, do you have the box? When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it. And I remember thinking "I'm a little too old for this." And I wasfive. Yes. Oh, I remember that. That was SO funny. Shhh. [begins playing recorder] Hi, Pam. I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok? Thanks Pam. Attention Scranton Business Park, there will be complimentary pretzels in the lobby from now until 4 o'clock as a thank you to our loyal tenants. I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys? No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind. I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel. Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown. And I will be taking questions. You drive. Night, Pam. Hey, what time is it? AM or PM? Oh, good. Oh. Koselli. With the Jello. Yes. Right. Good. Goodnight! Ah, hey. Hi. Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing. And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there? Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that? So... Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Oh, good. What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone. How far away did you think we were? Yeah. I have a question for you. How many words per minute does the average person type? Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90. Ok, I said average. Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it. No. 65. Ok, no need to laugh. Respectable? Right. Ok. Yeah. I know! No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later? No, you're making this up! Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories. And how many kitchens? Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley. Most apartments these days have like three. Yes! How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen? Pam? Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too. Oh, no no. Yeah, uh, well. Ok. Yeah. Bye Pam. You look so handsome. Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people. Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 'Sex and the City' at my place? I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends. Maybe you've got mono. No, you don't... Very official. Is there anything you wanted to ask us tonight? Is it? He's really outgoing, huh? Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second? Dry. You look like you were having fun. I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting? Oh, God! [chokes on food] Oh. Wow. That's so spicy. Oh. You waiting for a call? Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements. I was in that marriage arena, though. Yeah. Uuuuh... well. We're so alike. So alike. [leans in to kiss her] What are you doing? [scoffing noises] Can I have a ride home? These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'. Mmmm.. suck-ah! Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life. Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so... Nothing, Pam.[whispers to himself] What difference does it make? We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway. What? Do I have any messages? I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. [chuckles] I really couldn't be happier. Yes! [in Scranton] Where's Michael? Stanley! [hugs Stanley] Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him. Back? No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news. Is Jim coming back. I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk. Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying sh*ts. All right. Hey, I hear Jim's coming back. [to Pam] I'll tell you later. Crazy day, huh? Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here. Yeah, me too. What? Hey. Ah, pretty good. I finished. Psh, why is that great? Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time. Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake. Man, what is taking Toby so long? And you'll compare the times? No, my groin... ...is really tight. I can't... [starts running] Aaaaah! The Japanese camp guards of World w*r II always chose one man to k*ll whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person. Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league. Okay. No. Hi. Karen. I love your sweater. Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here. Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met... Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good. Oh, this looks promising. You're welcome. Hey! Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase. Well, I'm evolving, Pam. Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled. All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work. All right! Hey. I thought you had already... left. Oh... Good. Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something. I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh... O..ok. Um..good. Right. He. That's his favorite color. Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line. In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened. Cool. Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust. I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day. Michael, why don't we get outdoors time? Not good. Uh... a little bit bigger than Michael's office... but, you know, I really only slept there. You know, during the day, there-our time's our own. They had uh, classes, I took some... watercolor classes. They did, taught by some uh, Harvard business school guys--a lot of the guys also, that were in the class, the inmates, a lot of them have gone on to do extraordinary things in business. Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around. Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay? Shh. Think about it. I'll h*t you back. Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go! Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm. No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's b*tch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life. [turns around, takes bandanna off] So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it? Merry Christmas! [holds up dead goose and puts it on Pam's desk] Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead. I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle! Clean it in your car. [Riding a bicycle down the hallway and singing] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la. [Struggling to stay on] 'Tis the ... ack. [expletive] Hey! [to Pam] I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint... I'm looking for the toy drive box. Oh, thanks. [Michael and Andy do a fist bump and expl*si*n.] Yes? [Pam holds up a bag] Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that. OK. Did everybody get one of these? I know. [Closes door.] What? Are you serious? [Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow. [closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know? No, because of the promotion. It just feels a little bit, like... Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley. Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts. It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms. [moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts? Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary? And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to? Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me? This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her. I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her. Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go. Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..? Right. Oh cool, yeah. Oh, thank you. [Pam puts up another flyer] What is that? [Reads flyer] The "Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?" There's no such thing as the "Committee to Plan Parties." Two hundred dollars. Umm, two hundred and one dollars. And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five. Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately. You should, you should put out salt for the rims [referring to margaritas] I was just getting a snack. So I only use three? OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows? OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper? [Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. [leaves room] He's cute. You should date him. You're right. That's good. [Angela slams phone shut and runs back to office.] Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now [opens door to conference room.] [Stanley gets up and walks towards the break room.] All right Stanley. Woo. No, it's an invitation. Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. [Pam and Karen look at each other] What? Looks like they forgot the power cord. Walkie-talkies. Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas. I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs? Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. [Goes to plant and picks up power cord] Is it this one? Yeah, thanks. Bye Pam. [to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents. Oh no, that would be great. Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter? Hey, mon! Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax. Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later. Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me. Feelin' hot, hot, hot! [playing conch shell] Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing. You know, I had never been out of the country before now? Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time. Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three. Inventory's at the end of December. Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? [points to a TV monitor of a picture from Jamaica and reads] "No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem." This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem. What? Where? Boring. Call me if she rolls over. Hey. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen. So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much. Hmm, what? Yeah, I guess. Honestly, I think you should go easy on her. Hey, thanks a lot. Did you try the petting zoo? Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I h*t a deer. I h*t a deer with my car. Tell her I h*t a cat. Tell her I h*t a cat. Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot! [plays conch shell] Hey. Island living. You know? Did she say what it's about? I think I owe you one. For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing. Yeah, but... thanks. Seriously. Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he? [takes off coat to tie around waist] It's hot in here. Yeah. Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico? Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend. Oh, that is gross. Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he? Yeah. Right? Ok. Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee? Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun. Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight] This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot. Ow.[ Newpeat Quote ] We can custom make them.[ Newpeat Quote ] Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.[ Newpeat Quote ] How much did you win? I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night. Thanks.[ Newpeat Quote ] That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens. I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash. Mmm-hmm. Beesley, coffee? All right. Yeah. No way! All right Pam. Congratulations. [high five] Which one was it? Cool. Yeah. Can I see it when I get back? Congratulations. Wow. [walks over to the plant] What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible. Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning. Would you like to pull a prank on Andy? [hands Pam Andy's phone] Are there any messages? So weird. Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call. Oh. [hands Pam tape] Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. [Andy's phone rings] Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny! Oh, my GOD. [punches a hole in the wall] That... was an overreaction. Gonna h*t the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good? [inspecting the hole in the wall] Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall. Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours. Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra. We will demonstrate on Pam. Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights. SHUT UP ANGELA! Hey. Ugh. Oh yeah. Why? Oh. Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking. Yeah, I know I should. No, I'm sure you're right. Really? Good advice Beesley. Thanks. See you out there. Sparkling cider is very good. I have a lovely wife, Deborah. But I got all the foot off of it. Well, that is because I am a renaissance man. So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use? Hey um, I wanted to talk to you. I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys. Well that you kissed. And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal. It's just a kiss. Wait- you're not still interested in him? Really? Okay. So um, well good. What are you sorry about? What are you sorry about? You know I invented electricity. Well I'm sensing a little electricity right here. Yes, but I don't. My name is Gordon. Really? Looks like I hired the right guy. I'm glad. Any real potential there Beesley? Oh my God, I would get so fat if I worked here. You could strip you know. Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before. Ah, of course. This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it. Are you all right? This must be so awful for you. Well... this was supposed to be your wedding. There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant. Hey. I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste. I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom. I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning. Sorry about that. Hey. When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves? Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want. Hey, they're playing our song. I can't for your art show tonight. I-I wouldn't miss it for the world. Thanks. Love ya. I can't believe you're back together with Roy! Oh my God. You're so in love now. Oh, art show! ...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk] Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it. Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen. Oh. Oh. Maybe one day. Mmm. Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh? It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them. To my place? Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art. Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town. Wow! You did these... freehand? My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] ... How much? I don't see a... price. Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car? That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you. What? ...Chunky. Do you want half? I will get out. Oh yes, I will. Pam, would you smell my breath? Alright. Bye. I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered. Ok. Ok. Hey Pam. It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun b*ating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know. Hey. What's up, Pam. Ok. YES! I can read you like a book. Here. [hands Pam a duck stuffed animal] I was... What? That's awesome. That's what I want. I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all. What? Jim came on to you? No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening! Don't yell?! Hey... [Roy lunges towards Jim] [shrieks] Yeesh... Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit? It's European, OK? It's a European cut. No, they don't. See? [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam] Italians don't wear pockets. [mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument. Yeah, that was nuts. No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection. We'll see. I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday. [to Jim] Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. [Jim motions "Don't worry about it"] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something? I'm so sorry, Pammy. I really wasn't gonna do anything. But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and... I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong. So you gonna start datin' Halpert then? Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy. But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don't get you Pam. Good morning, Pam. Drew. I'm Drew now. It's a strategy! Oh, geeze. I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun. Damn it. Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right? Working in an office can lead to depression. Which can lead to su1c1de. I mean this is really serious stuff. I--- I--- Nobody commits su1c1de because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that... Yeah... you are... ah, so right. They had visual A*DS. And all we had were the facts. You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science. [Creed takes a bite of an apple] Creed is eating an apple. I found a potato. Hey! Hello. [Jim replaces Creed's apple with a potato][Creed takes a bite of the potato] Attention blue collar workers! Damn it. Oh. He's going to k*ll himself, pretending to k*ll himself. Hey uh, Michael. Don't jump on the bouncy castle. You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured. What is it? Dwight... Oh, that's funny. MICHAEL! Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time. Yes! You are entering the "No Spin Zone!" Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu. I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there. We would have caught this. We gotta do something. [exhales] This is spinning out of control, Pam. This is just, not... No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then... YouTube gets a hold of it... You're right. It will blow over. But it's not... going to take... a week or two. [pulls out a video camcorder from his desk] Do you know what this is for? Yes. So I'll know where--- I'm asking Pam to do it, please. Five, four, three. "There is no way, I will resign. It wouldn't be fair. Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me. Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway. If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me. They're trying to make me an escape goat. If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it. The F-word. You have one day." That's... they always give an ultimatum. Good, cut? [walks in dressed as Jim] Pam. Oh, you don't want to know. I think I just got flashed. In the parking lot. [on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls. If that's flashing, then lock me up. What's happening? Really? Is she OK? Mm... not really, no. No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community? Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody. I didn't really get a good look. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Have you finished with the sketch? Hmm, doesn't seem like the type. [Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide. Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window] You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish. Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it "shmear?" Like the cream cheese. Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls. Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex. No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it. No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing. No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs] not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Yeah, that's smart. Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories. Jim's gonna love it. [Karen giggles] Answer it. Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will... Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the... all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts] Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan? Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail. OK, I am really going to do this. I love you guys. Now I'm getting her voicemail. Not it. I don't have eggs. That's possible. Uh-huh? Hey, want my sun screen? Uh-huh. What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head. I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright? Well, [whispering] Hey Pam, did you get that down? Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't... [lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh] Okay Pam, I have another little project for you. Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it. Like umm...[looks at watch] ten minutes? I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points? Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook. Angela, it is a million degrees. No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score. Pointless. Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay. [clears throat, breathes noisily] The mind has to wrap around the foot. [exhales] Okay. [yelling excitedly for Dwight to get off the coals] The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, "Describe your act." And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, "What do you call yourselves?" And the man says, "The Aristocrats!" That is a very, very funny story. Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless. Thanks, Pam. Ohhhhh... Hey. It's okay, we all say things without thinking. Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship. [group laughs] Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam. Who is D. Abramson? Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem. Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen. Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages. Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow? Thanks. No, no. What do I do? She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do. I wasn't. You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together. Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out. Yeah, bigger actually. Mm-hm. I know! What did I say!? Thanks. So, I guess we're getting back together. You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk. Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession. I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand. I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager. Well, in a sense. Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position. Correct, I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped of its pomp and frills. Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistanttothe Regional Manager. Do you accept? Absolutely, I do. Oh, Michael's not going anywhere. Listen up! Come to the center of the room, please. This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch. Yes! Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is "me." Conference room! Ten seconds! All of you! [grumbling, getting loud] [in the office, imitating the terminator] I'll be baaaaack! And I am baaaack! So I'm back. And I am never, ever going to leave. I am going nowhere. This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones. Pam, hello. I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute] [flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet? The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here. And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back. Well, I wish you would. [phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just one moment, I'll transfer you. Pam. [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight? All right. Then... it's a date.
