Oh, I can do that. [turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams? Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company. [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time] Ok, see you next week. Bye. [to Karen] Again? Scared? Oh please, don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women. I'm sorry what are you whispering about? I'm trying--- Oh. [leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen] What's going on with Fairfield County schools? Karen, did you generate that price list? Thank you, everyone. What's up? Oh. Okay, that is a "no" on the on the West Side Market. Wow. Never pegged you for a quitter. Really? Did you check the vending machine? I have no idea. We went right for the copier. And then we checked the fax machine. [on phone] Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah. You have 'em in the warehouse. Great. What is my store number... six. Wait, no. I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen]. No, no, no! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He d*ed alone. The least you can do is be there for him now. [to Dwight] Find a box for him. Nice! Sounded good. Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into. When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now. What? Is it? No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair. Can you stand up? And talk to me over there? I'm acting my heart out here. Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm. [sings] Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me, fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me, I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work. Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny, little arms. All right. Think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner. And Karen? Let's keep it to twenty dollars a person this time. Good. [sings Indigo Girls] I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children... [sing] the less I seek my source... [sing] the closer I am to fi-i-i-ne. The closer I am to.. If you sit in the back. Oh. I'm a drunk driver. Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli. No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right. So good. Hey. When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, "Something Weird is Going On." Colon, "What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute." Ahhhhh! [hugs Ryan] I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! [kisses him] This is the best day of my whole l ife! I really don't know. How you doing with all this? You'd actually move to Scranton? New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York? Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it. Okay. Sounds good Andy. Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later? Hi! I'm Pam. Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome! [in robot voice] Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader. Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'. Terrible. Totally unconvincing. Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian. You feel good? All right. Right place at the right time. What smell? Oh, I'll help you find it. What is it? My perfume? Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine. Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them. Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on! Oh, we find little times during the day. Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up. [talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli? [laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day? Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back? Ok, thanks. [climbs under desk] Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from "Look Who's Talking." What am I thinking? [Laughs] Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts. Hey. Oh. Please. Colin Powell. Yup. [singsong voice] Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this? Yup. That's perfect. Perfect. ...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him. ...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but... The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt! No, orange is whorish. It would never work here. No. God help you. These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of "A Nutcracker Christmas." I think you should leave. Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy. Um, usually like that. I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh] Um, I really liked your karaoke idea. That could really be fun. You guys do a raffle? Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding. What's ours again? Then why are there two flyers? Right. Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right? Bye. Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.] Yup. We have vodka! Don't push it. No thanks. They're too sweet. What? No. I've had the worse day here [turns up Nutcracker music on the stereo. [Sighs. Dwight reaches for and holds Angela's hand] No... way! Yeah! Oh. Yes! [holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas. Mmm. Hmm. We'll go tell everyone. [into another walkie-talkie] Copy, Possum. What's your twenty? What a horrible, horrible movie that was. Thank you. OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm? Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK. You want to talk about it? Nope. OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping. Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper] All right. Sorry? Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous. We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen. Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the "Amazing Race." [To Ryan and Stanley] And you guys are the retired marines. [To Phyllis and Karen] And you guys are the mother and daughter. [To Dwight and Jim] And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go? Do you have a pole? Ok. It's a big order. Thanks Kenny. Well then. Have a nice day. Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person. I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her. Oh, doggie. Sure. Look at you! Well, I don't have a lot of choices. Ok. Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something? Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay? Hey man. [Dwight hugs Jim and leaves] Hey. So Andy is in rare form today. Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something. Hey. 15. It is the only time that Bob was available. Sort of a guy's night out. A G-N-O if you will. A Gah-No. Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in. A G-A-I. A gay. Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys. A guy shower. An hour long shower with guys. Halpert! Tall, q*eer, handsome as ever. Hey everybody it's me, Jim. Hello, hello. Todd Packer. Shut up! Shut it! It was a warm June evening in 1752, the night of my fateful kite flight. Yes? Okay Ben Franklin! [Stanley's fork breaks.] Of course. Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it. What do you mean? Oh yeah. Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing. You should definitely go out with Jim. I mean, you're going out with Jim. I'm not going out with Jim. You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together. I'm not into Jim. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Um, what? A toaster, you? Those flowers are nice. Phyllis and Robert. Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen. Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT! Ow! That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot. We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops] Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare. It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them. Bagel bites or something. Cool, let's start with the banisters. Yep. Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me. Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care. Oh. Hadn't noticed. You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and sh**t hoops with David Wallace. Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me. So, none of them? Really? Ok. I don't know. Feel like... Friday night crowds... Agoraphobic? Really? Kev, have a good weekend. Here we go... Ok... ROY! It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little. Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman? You must have been scared out of your mind. What happened, exactly? I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story. Mm-hmm. [flustered] Goodness. It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating. Well... yes, that's probably what it is. So what do I do? I'm gonna say fifty. That is lame. It's called being smart. Nice. To save time, Jim. [scoffs] Pssssh. I look like an idiot. Hey Karen. Do you? OK. That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones. Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen. OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the t*rrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and h*t 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that. Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me. Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything. No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist. If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides. You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps] Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy. [groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form. She does have very nice clothes. I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex. Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear. Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply] It's Jan. What do I do? You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. [sighs] [to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole. [to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes! Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright. It's alright. Here we go. Aaaaaand, go! [on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye. In well? How would that work in well? I just want to know. Wait a minute. If this job is in a well, I don't want it. Hey. Um, about the beach... Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird. [confused] Oh. Okay. Pam is... kind of a b*tch. Why so you can do it? Hmmm. Your loss. Cruise control. So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room. 'Cause of Jan again? Uh, sure. I really hope you get the job. I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please... Wow. [mouths] Wow! Unbelievable. She could put the cup right there. Saving the best for first! This interview is over. I'll let you know. Totally, no problem. What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or... Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too? What did she accomplish? Oh... Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life. She treated me poorly. We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman. Love is a mystery. Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.? Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip. [Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels. That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was] Oh do you mean when I get the job? You mean Kevin? [exhales] How are you guys doing? Need anything? Zip your lid! Okay. Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but... ...what do you think about Michael Scott? This is off the record. Good. That's all I ever wanted. These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them... excellent candidates. Yeah. Kinda feel bad for her though. Oh, man. You know what? This might take a while. You really don't have to stay, if you don't want. Okay. Sure.
