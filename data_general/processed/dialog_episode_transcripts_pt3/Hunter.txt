You should just read the report that Toby did. He took everyone's stories. [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly. Oh yeah I could totally help you with that. Ok, let me just get the folder out. Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper. Oh, 12 reams... You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on? Hey! Hunter! Wha's up my brutha? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire. Jan in yet? Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in? Just say, "I want to squeeze them." It's code. She'll know what it means. [giving a hug] Bye Hunter. Good luck with your band.
