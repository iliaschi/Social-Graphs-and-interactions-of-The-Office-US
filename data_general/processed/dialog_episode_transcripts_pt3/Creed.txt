Uh, hey... Creed? You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop. I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better. No, you wanna leave. Why... why are you making this so hard? I think you're right. No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye. Hmm? What old days? What are you talking about? It's right here on the desk, yeah. I can't, I can't... I can't change anything. This is the way... I don't... okay, just listen. I have to f*re someone today, okay? Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you. Don't... Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words. Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag] Great. Where did you get it? He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag. [coming out of his office] Lampshade on head! It's happening! No, never heard of it. No, arealdisability, not a woman's trouble. Jim has got it bad for Pam. Creed did you organize the menu book? No, that was mandatory. How do you know that? What is it, then? Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute. Guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired. Charley horse! Charley horse! Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know. Are you kidding? I thought it was you. Do you remember Ed Truck? How would I know? My biggest fear is turning into him. Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me. Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't... Where do I want to go? I'd send you to Hong Kong. ...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right? Say hi to the kids. Yaaaaay. What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem? [grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit. [snaps a photo of Creed, then Creed turns to the side for a profile sh*t] No, you're all good. I didn't say that. OK, Ryan. You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell? You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization. No. Humans with A*DS. Okay. Excuse me. Big moment. The evening's chip leader and winner of this beautiful mini-refrigerator courtesy of Vance Refrigeration, Creed Bratton, Dunder Mifflin! Yes I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now? [singing] Um, um, um... That town is full of history! What? Please go back to your desk. Mmm, that's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So, I think we should go get some. Now, please. Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'. The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that. Really? That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart. You're thinking of a chicken. And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before? I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting. How did you... This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison. You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow. I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it? [Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toyinthe box, Creed. Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party. Guilty. Gerty's. I don't remember. Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance-- --to use sudden v*olence. Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake? What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat. I really want to come out! Hey Creed. You're the man buddy. Yeah. I heard you might need it. So... I didn't give you $40. I am makin' it happen, sergeant. Hey Creed. Hey. At least we're outside. You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed? Creed. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy. Hereis your headline. "Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, apologizes to valued client. Some companies still know how business is done." Okay? Battle stations everybody, let's go, go, go, go, go, go! Yes, hello. Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton. I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there. And I'm trying to remember who it was. Mm-hmm. Who wasn't there last week? Debbie Brown. And which day was that? Wednesday, the eleventh. Perfect. OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doingsooogood. Look, you have so many good qualities, that the one that you might wanna work on is, apologizing? Emergency dentist appointment. Thought so too. [to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown. I thought maybe you'd like to sign it. Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her. She's got some children. Phyllis. You're a married woman. The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss? I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter. I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time. You're in here. [all get up to leave] OK. Damn it! Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three? You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said. I remember. I blogged the whole thing. I love fake boobs. Often times, you find them on strippers.
