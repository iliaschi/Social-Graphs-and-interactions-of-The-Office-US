You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing. Hey. You wanna go to the beach? You wanna get high? I think you do, mon. He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom. This is not good. What was that? What are you guys talking about? Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday. Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it. I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind. Yeah? How about green? So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious. Oh! Surprise. This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers? I think we could have done better than that. [to camera] Classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game. [Phyllis scores] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what's the score? Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly. You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet? Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality. What colors do you like? And the "Tight Ass" award goes to Angela. Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose. So...come on down. Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously? Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that? Sometimes we play "Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?" Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system. Are you sure you don't want to play? Come on Angela, don't you have a game? Well, let's play, what is it? We're friends. [alarm sounds] People! This is not a test! Move to the exits! Head towards the exits. Get up off your desks! No, panic is warranted! This is not at drill! Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively! Do you want to die? OUT!! STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim? Move to the exits! Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela. That's one book. You've got two others. Nice. Third book? Um, The DaVinci Code. Nice. Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond? Dwight. Hey! You guys excited about the party? Yeah. All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such? Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good? Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers. Um. He sticks to his g*n. Yes? Yeah? Make him be quiet. No, I made brownies. ... What? I made brownies. [takes the gift certificate and tears it up] Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, I'm going to be at Poor Richard's. And the rest of you can go to hell! You were a Jet? Dwight? I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's g*ngb*ng this thing and go home. Good? Dwight. Good work, Stanley. Great performance review. Stanley in the house, everybody. Woo! Angela, your turn. Well, I heard they made outandhad sex. Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box. Yeah, is that hard for you? Alright, well- I'll work on that- Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately. Hey, Angela- How's it going? Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight? No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so. Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy. Where you rushin' off to? Yeah, well duh. Where ya headed? Liar! You are a liar. Angela, burger? Dog? Havin' fun? Chicken, hot dog, burger. There is soda inside. I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper? There's gotta be something else we can talk about. So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel. Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones? [comes into the conference room in a Santa hat and beard] Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, [points to Ryan] pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting? No. Because it's better. Because it's more special. Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a sh*t. Angela, you're up. Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty. We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some? [singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning? Huh. Do you like candy? Cause you're sweeter than candy. What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing] Oh, now you feel some compassion for him. Why don't you go with him? Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes. They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar? That's unacceptable. No. Yeah, it's a business lunch. Angela who would you choose Jim or Roy? Hi, guys. I'm just walking around. I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that. No. Okay. Stop. Go on... Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be. Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this? Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck. Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten. Oh I did. I did. Oh, I bet you will before the day is over. [delivering plant to Oscar's desk] Oscar. What the hell is going on here? It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here. [song] You all ready for this? I've never, ever seen you take a sick day. I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter. Do you need any help? Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela? Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. [cracks up] One's good. Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom. It's going to be okay. Yes. Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good. Just the bread, it's fresh baked. Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake. Oh. I got it. [whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything. What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances? [whispering] But what if i'm hungry? Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day. I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently. Where were you yesterday after work? Angela, what about you? You're not onanything? We don't feel that way. No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup. I want him to have all the urine he needs. Oh, thanks! [holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style. Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation? [in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using "I" emotion language and no judging or "you" statements. No. Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution. Fine. Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code. Oh. Thanks. How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble "merely listen to and forgotten..." ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute? I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting. [off camera] You just press the button. Well, then, they need our money more than ever. Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he issohot. And he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring. I know he didn't do it. ...Maybe he did it. It's all on you, baby. Let's go. Yes. Thank you, Angela. I'm sorry? Well, it's probably just some accounting error. Well, it could be... Okay. I'm pretty sure Michael's involved because every other time there's been money missing from the office, it's always been Michael. Except, he's usually really obvious. Like, he'll say he spent $50 on a lunch with a client, and he'll submit a receipt from J. Crew. I went over my books three times. Has anyone in the office bought anything nice recently? Yes, it is. My grandfather left it to me when he d*ed. Hi, Phyllis. Um, we're going over everyone's expenses for the year. It's just standard procedure. Oh, my God. An emergency like, you have an ice cream cake, and you're in the sun, and it's melting? Okay.[ The Accountants, Webisode 03 - "Meredith" ] We're trying to find out who stole money from the company. Why don't we just ask her if she took the $3,000? You think I stole $3,000? Yeah. So, that's too early? I hope they bought something nice, and I hope you never catch them. I don't think it was him. Angela thinks it's an insult when she calls me a genius, all sarcastic and whatnot, but technically, guess what? I am a genius. When I was a kid, I took an IQ test and I scored over 100. So, joke is on you, Angela. But, my mom's in town, so I can't go. I really don't think it was anyone in the office. It had to have been someone. Maybe it was Roy. He's getting married. He can use the money. How do you know? You have a crush on Roy. You have a crush on Roy. Unbelievable. Does he excite you? Does he get your blood flowing? [Oscar growls] Does he get your... [Oscar growls] Wait, hold on. I'd never do something like that. It's wrong. I don't steal things. So, it isn't Phyllis, it isn't Stanley or Jim, it isn't Meredith, it isn't any of us. I didn't steal $3,000 from petty cash. I am not stupid. If I wanted to steal from this company, there are a lot of easier ways to do it. For example, I could seal people's coats and sell them on eBay. Okay, enough of this investigation stuff. We just have to put a memo to the office and ask that someone come forward anonymously. No, I wanna write it. No. Angela, you never let me write accounting memos. Yeah. [Oscar bumps into Kevin as they leave the conference room] God. Yeah, as in "justifiable homicide." Fine, then you write it. ANGELA STINKS. Kevin Malone, Accounting"] Angela stinks. I mean, I'm not handing it out or anything. And don't tell her I said it. It's just for me. In fact, forget that I said anything about it, ever. Oh, God. What have I done? [groans][ The Accountants, Webisode 07 - "Things Are Getting Tense" ] Wait. Here, I found it! Here it is! $2,800 returned to petty cash. Angela, I forgot to sign in the money. Oops. Um, I took that and then I briefly lost it, but then the Pistons b*at the Cavs, and so now I'm returning it all back. Go Pistons. But this is completely unrelated to the other $3,000. Yeah, but I won, didn't I? Oh, suspicious. Well, how come Angela suddenly has a new necklace, all of a sudden? What friend? What? That's not even close to being a real person. The guys who stole the money. He is still in there. What time is it now? It's slow. Well, you can't just tell me what time it is? Nothing. Nothing. I just want a new wok, there's a new one... It's okay. Shh, shh. This is so much fun. [in megaphone] Attention! There is a lot of junk in here! Over! You think he's gonna dust for fingerprints? What are we even looking for? Check this out. "Michael Scott is the proud owner of a quality Seyko timepiece." You think he paid $3,000 for a knock-off of a $40 watch? I'd lock it, too. That is very embarrassing. Okay, just go to Quicken, 'cause I setup online checking for him. Go to the beginning of the month. But what are you doing? I do not think you should do that. [in unison] Not it. You're saying Michael stole money from his own company? No! No, that's insane. It has to be somebody else. Like Meredith. Or Creed. No. Meredith, definitely. Which is exactly what you'd say if you did do it. Oh, man! I should've been handling this investigation from the beginning. There has to be a better explanation. He charged it. Discover. Made a little cash back on the deal. Smart. If he were a general in the Army, and you accused him without proof, you would be court-martialed in front of a f*ring squad. Okay, watch "A Few Good Men" and tell me that that's not true. I own it on DVD if you wanna come by later. "You can't handle the truth." Just kidding, you can. We, uh... We found it. In your books. You accidentally logged this equipment depreciation twice. Did you let someone else have access to your books? Then... Yeah. Oh. That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that. Yes I'm super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton. Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan. What are you doing?! Who should be the judges and juries of our society? Right there. Ah. Don't be mad, it is a business trip. Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager. Yes, Monkey. Don't "Monkey" me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M. There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train? That town smells like cheese steaks. Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out. Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard. Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who. No. [walking past Dwight's desk] Kitchen. That's not going to happen. Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms. Michael would never let me... I could never do that! Fine! Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired! You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that. Maybe I'll quit. Yes. I,will, make a difference here. Hey. If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice. You are not leaving. No! We are not done. Well, you can't get diseases from a bird! Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby k*lled this bird. And now we are going to honor it. An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he d*ed, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone. Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten. I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be? Oh my God, I'm so worried. I don't know. Dwight's so weird. No, he's a freak. Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going? Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think. Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that. Thank you, Kevin. Well, I find it beautiful. Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes? I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions... It's all vegetarian. It's hot in there. How's the naan? I am. You should come dance with us. Traitor. You are a traitor. It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number. How about Cugino's? How 'bout Cooper's then? But, I don't want to go to DJ's. Hooters? Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe. Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver. Do you like it? Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way. Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional. Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know. [over phone] Mmhmm. When did the check come? Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move. Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby. Hmm. Andy. Okay. Angela? All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say "Boo" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like [puts on bandanna]. I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?! Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison? Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why? I thought you said green was whorish. Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement]. Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ... Yes. What? You're kidding. Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.] It'll be all right. There is now. We just started it. What's your funding? [pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun. That's a great idea. You can have your snack in here. Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... . I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside] I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party. [with conviction] Start the party. Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.] Why would I be disappointed? I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.] Is that a thr*at? I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm... I got goose bumps. [tries to break nut on a Nutcracker doll] These nuts are really hard to cr*ck. You've got to be kidding! My new girlfriend. Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room. I thought I could have it. All right [high fives Kevin] No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party] Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties. Yeah, but we don't have a power cord. [into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy? I totally rebounded. Someone else sh**t and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually sh**ting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o. [on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive... Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out] Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it. Yep, it's English, it's "impossible." OK. I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs. Angela. That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them? Are you sure? It is a big deal. Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river. Everything is fine. You are in the clear. Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder. Really? Ok. Sure. Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time. That's great. Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest. Oh. Oh? Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand. It's going to be ok. That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan. Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed. [sits at his desk] Hi, Angela. [lurking by the bathroom door] Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss. The one of all women? Because I'm gay? OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you. Can I join too? Nice to have Oscar back. Angela? Is everything okay? [trying to look in Phyllis's desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don't trust you, Phyllis! Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company. Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you? [imitating Andy] "It's not freakin' funny!" Yay. [scattered appalause] What's up spinsters? Okay. Co-ed naked strippers in this office. For realsies. What? I think that's champagne. Oh I love your poster. Hello, Angela. You look as beautiful as the Queen of England. Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. [generalized clapping and cheering] Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! Goooood bye. The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open. Thanks man. It was crazy. Well, I heard some shouting. And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. Jim says something. Roy stomps over there. All of the sudden, BAM. Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero. It was insane! Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared. Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry. And he's a big dude, you know? And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt. 30. Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what. I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car. [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that. So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels. Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter--- And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like "No!" Four. Really? Mm, good stuff. Oh, excuse me. It's my... favorite part. Midnight, Oscar!Don't worry, Kelly will be training you first. This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. Thisdayis bananas! B-A-N-A- I know, right? Probably a lot. [on phone] Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale. Ask where he's from. OK, great. Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry. And you're sorry. OK, ready? [thinks] Eleven. [laughs] Yes. [air high five] I expect you to apologize for that, Angela. Oh, but you still said "I'm sorry." Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map. OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher] I don't remember doing that. Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut. Ye - OK, yes. Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that. [tires screeching] Oh. Thanks, Michael. I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress. OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store. I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe. Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes! Sabotage. No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team. [Trying to wet bandana, falls in water] Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody! Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously! Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it! Are you going to try it? Being the boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. "Outside Hire." What? Yes, I... I have to buy another place. How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton? No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job. What if she makes me?
