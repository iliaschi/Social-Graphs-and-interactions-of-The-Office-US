[screams] Oh no! Oh. It's locked! Please, don't. I have a family. This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country. Oh, man, so many points being made. Yeah, your nephew is so lame. You follow him on Twitter? You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to "Pretty Woman" their asses. Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute "break a legs" or "I still love you" type texts. Doesn't look like I got anything. Maybe on my Facebook wall. Get your eyes checked, chucklehead. Then I will write it down. I actually had that down in the cons column, but... Rude. And not helpful. Well, that...really bums me out. Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys. I think he- Shake things up. I'm a Nader guy. [muttering going on all around, Andy looks sick] Hey Creed, would you read Chinese? What does this say? What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure? Are you kidding me? Hey, back off. It's Solitare. Talk to me. Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people? Parley? So everyone here knows pirate code? Wow. You have a whole room of vending machines? [holding a knitted iPad case] It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you. Yes. Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours? How is it going? What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel! You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone? Loser. Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room. You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends. One, two, three. [does cartwheel] I did it! I did a cartwheel! Look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where you're going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot. You ready to do this? You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes. It's about you. It's about you. Go! You did? Okay. Go. Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton. [applause] Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking. Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay? You helped me get off dr*gs! Hey Creed. No no no, let me see. [picks up the mostly knitted mittens] Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em. [waves goodbye to her with the mittens] [Michael begins walking out the office, he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working, and Jim looking back, teary eyed] [looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight! You mean the frozen mice for the piranha? [drives up to the entrance of the building, his license plate reads "NEW MGR"] It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. [gets out of car, tosses his keys toward a nonexistent valet parker] Keep it running. Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. [slowly getting more excited] I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling. [to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language] He never called a meeting. What are we doing? Um... Business! [on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say "Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy. Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven. Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix. [Jo's phone starts vibrating, she picks it up and sees Dwight has texted her "Dwight's ability as a manager has lead him to higher levels of proffesional success,"] Oh for god's sake. He's texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I'm roaming! Hello! This is... the client. Yes. Great. I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves] [in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right? Well, okay! Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me! Yeah, I lost my client. Looks terribly real, doesn't it, Creed? Are you scared of snakes? When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family's. It was rumored a man committed su1c1de there after being possessed by the devil. One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound. [hisses] She walked to the nursery, and there, in baby's crib, was a snake wrapped around baby's neck, squeezing tighter and tighter. Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed] Exactly. Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you're in a su1c1de cult. [shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right? Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee. .....Chad Flendermen's kryptonite. [Darryl walks up to Toby and Val in a tuxedo] Oh, we got this! Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them. Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers. Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does. No, it's the pacifier's turn. Thirty minutes! Ahh! [laughs] Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet. Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. [whispers to Kelly] I put out some new magazines, check it out. Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let's try it. Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane. [everyone turns to look at Creed] [to Creed standing in front of the "treasure box"] Now, carefully... open the box. [panting] Well fought. I accept the outcome. Welcome to your party. Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long. [plays off-tune notes] Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a t*rture to work with. Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.Robert & [in unison] How old? Creed, you are a thousand years old. Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy! Me? I have a delicious secret. Woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] Ahh!! [interrupting] Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores. [distributing paperwork to the office] Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived. [excited] Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank. Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan. What? Come on. Role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! Role call. I didn't realize that everybody here dresses up every year. Me neither. Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where's the band? â€˜Cause there's just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths. [On phone] Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. [hangs up] Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio? Hey remember that week in the 90's when we got bagels? All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed. Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you. Nice. Nice. Topless Christmas. Tapas swiss miss. We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible. Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to.. Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy? [putting mayo on Creed's head] Creed, I'm all done. My turn. Hey, where's my ring? It's all gone. I didn't get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant. Shut up! So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example? Yeah, and somebody had the b*lls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83. You're clearly snooping. Everyone please, just- Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office] We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that. [as elevator door closes] Hold it! We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity? $3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen. What?! Ohh. And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over. Well that kind of worked out. Brava, brava. [while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol! I can't believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe. You're a dad! Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal. Hi, I'm Dakota. Nice. You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It's not much. But if you see it in the right way...And that's what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn't once show me doing my origami. [walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh! Thanks Phyl. Do you even have a mattress? You're not gay. Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now? Hi, I'm Dakota. Nice. You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It's not much. But if you see it in the right way...And that's what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn't once show me doing my origami. [walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh! Thanks Phyl. Do you even have a mattress? You're not gay. Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now? No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers. I have no idea. That's why we're cursed. OK, name please. You're over 75 years old? There's no prize money. You're doing great Michael, look at you go! Oh God! My nipples, it's starting. OK. Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave] As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can h*t the ground running with a new system. Cool beans. Who is? I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred. Creed? Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black] Everything's cool, dude. Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much? [speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing. No, sometimes its right. Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that? No you didn't. Listen, I've got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away. How would that help Creed? In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose. That is a good point. Like the witness protection program. Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-? Line it up Phyllis. Yeah, people like me I guess. [knocking from outside window in break room] Jim. Well I think Meredith was just -- Everybody's birthday. What do you want? You want a birthday pie? Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie. It will be Angela. Why don't you mind your business? Probably went to his head. Hey guys, what're we talking about? Oh, I'll take 'em. Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. [phone rings] [on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet. [on phone] Daat! And then an older gentleman asked you "Boxers or briefs?" It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or... No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message] I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go? Extension 128. [over phone] Hiya Pumpkin, it's Creed. No. Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet. Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here. What do you do here? ...Excuse me. Hey, that's good. Oh my gosh. Yes. No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers. That's not what that is. [spreading peanut butter on a bagel] What? I swallowed a tapeworm last night. It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat. And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it. Creed sold it to me. It's from Mexico. What about her looks? No, nothing. Nothing Michael! Just saying hi. [Michael waves "hi" at the phone] Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah. Oh no, it's actually really hygienic, Creed. I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back. Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says "Creed." [Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome. I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you. Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back] Ohhh... Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay? Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding dr*gs in this very office. [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears] Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that. Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks. No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time. The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win. Hillary Swank. Yes! [Dwight pulls f*re alarm] Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!Phyllis and Okay, I got it. Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card. If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest. I hope he's ok, I feel bad. He just sent a text... [quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away] Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up. Okay, it sounds risky. [leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party. Oh, great. Seven thousand dollars. Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now. Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist. Oh Pam. During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.' I don't think he even uses the bathroom. Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper. These are shaped like paper. Yeah, yeah. The Shield. I know. Yeah, it's...kinda-- That's true. That's right. Yeah. It's casual day. Happy? [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office] Well, what if I just do this? Thanks. Oh, I'm engaged to Pam. Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter? [puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name. Let's go. Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa. Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place. Nobody! [approaching Jim and Pam] Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba. I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls? Step away. Jim. Four months. Do not mind! Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't mind. Catch you guys on the flippity flop. Oh this... call waiting. [answers his phone] Yeah, uh huh, well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes. Yeah. Nope. No, I think they're talking about me. Alright. Let's get started. We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises. I think it was Creed. Yes, what else? Disgusting... Nobody told me what people were, alright? So... label yourselves or take what you get. A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay. What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm. It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello? Well that's great. [hangs up phone] Turns out the paper was there all along. [sighs] Thank God. Y'all. [accent] Sir, there has been a m*rder, and you are a suspect. Do you love her or do you love the idea of her? My idea! It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good! Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you! Yes. Thank you! Wish me luck! What do we got? Creed, disqualified. You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality. No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love. Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this. Okay geniuses, how would you do it? [pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah! Yeah, I noticed that. Nope. [on Jo's jet] Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police. Yes, it's totally obvious. Uh, hey... Creed? You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop. I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better. No, you wanna leave. Why... why are you making this so hard? I think you're right. No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye. Hmm? What old days? What are you talking about? It's right here on the desk, yeah. I can't, I can't... I can't change anything. This is the way... I don't... okay, just listen. I have to f*re someone today, okay? Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you. Don't... Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words. Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag] Great. Where did you get it? He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag. [coming out of his office] Lampshade on head! It's happening! No, never heard of it. No, arealdisability, not a woman's trouble. Jim has got it bad for Pam. Creed did you organize the menu book? No, that was mandatory. How do you know that? What is it, then? Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute. Guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired. Charley horse! Charley horse! Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know. Are you kidding? I thought it was you. Do you remember Ed Truck? How would I know? My biggest fear is turning into him. Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me. Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't... Where do I want to go? I'd send you to Hong Kong. ...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right? Say hi to the kids. Yaaaaay. What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem? [grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit. [snaps a photo of Creed, then Creed turns to the side for a profile sh*t] No, you're all good. I didn't say that. OK, Ryan. You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell? You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization. No. Humans with A*DS. Okay. Excuse me. Big moment. The evening's chip leader and winner of this beautiful mini-refrigerator courtesy of Vance Refrigeration, Creed Bratton, Dunder Mifflin! Yes I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now? [singing] Um, um, um... That town is full of history! What? Please go back to your desk. Mmm, that's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So, I think we should go get some. Now, please. Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'. The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that. Really? That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart. You're thinking of a chicken. And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before? I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting. How did you... This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison. You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow. I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it? [Creed takes toy from toy drive box.] Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toyinthe box, Creed. Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party. Guilty. Gerty's. I don't remember. Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance-- --to use sudden v*olence. Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake? What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat. I really want to come out! Hey Creed. You're the man buddy. Yeah. I heard you might need it. So... I didn't give you $40. I am makin' it happen, sergeant. Hey Creed. Hey. At least we're outside. You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed? Creed. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy. Hereis your headline. "Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, apologizes to valued client. Some companies still know how business is done." Okay? Battle stations everybody, let's go, go, go, go, go, go! Yes, hello. Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton. I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there. And I'm trying to remember who it was. Mm-hmm. Who wasn't there last week? Debbie Brown. And which day was that? Wednesday, the eleventh. Perfect. OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doingsooogood. Look, you have so many good qualities, that the one that you might wanna work on is, apologizing? Emergency dentist appointment. Thought so too. [to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown. I thought maybe you'd like to sign it. Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her. She's got some children. Phyllis. You're a married woman. The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss? I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter. I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time. You're in here. [all get up to leave] OK. Damn it! Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three? You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said. I remember. I blogged the whole thing. I love fake boobs. Often times, you find them on strippers.
