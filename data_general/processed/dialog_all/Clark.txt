Andy's coming back today! There's two new guys back there with me now. They're in their 20s. And we really get along. Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time. Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr. I don't see it. Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods! Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested? Well, we're both just kinda learning as we go, aren't we? Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head. So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man? Spoken like a true root man. My calls? You want a list of my clients? You want my leads? With my leads and stuff like that? Cause you're interested in going into sales? Wow, that's great. That's great. Ok, good, let's talk about that, ok? Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed. Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up. Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy. Boo, unimpressed. It's a tightrope for babies. Boo! Ok, I am just getting started, ok? Well, it's addressed to Customer Service so, it's your mail. That's really nice. OK, Kenny. Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad. Uh, is it Duncan? You mean, put me on the news? Maybe, ok? Let me think about it. Whoo! [entering annex] Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does Erin need for this news audition? Really? Seems unnecessary for an audition. Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take Erin to the mall and get that stuff. Awesome. [to Pete] Plop! This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job. Goodnight. Yeah. All right! Nice. He sure did. Just, you sure Clark? No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that. I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing. Yeah we noticed early on, Andy really appreciates enthusiasm. So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders. Oooohhhhhhhh![They clap when Andy slams dunks his garbage into the bin][They clap when Andy prints a paper copy out][They clap when the water cooler jar makes bubbles while Andy is standing next to it.] Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point. [Jim puts popcorn bag in microwave] Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so. Come on! Just show me the Power Point. You're the tutorial. You could be. Awesome, right? [leaves] He hates me and thinks I'm a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness. [Erin nods] How many times do you need to take a stroll? Alright, alright, g*ng. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face. Just...you good? [Sitting outside building] Stop. Too late. Dwight! Ugh. I don't want to sit through a whole concert of that. [still singing] Yeah. That's what she said. [singing ‘Car Wash'] Oh Man! [clapping] Toby got us all to participate in Movember. It's a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November. I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex. Oh, my God. Okay, you do not have to do this. [giggles] Okay, see you later. Hey, so how was it? I mean... the sex with Jan. A gentleman doesn't discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved. Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, "Talk classy, act nasty". What, is it on backwards? [partially removes wig, revealing her bald head] There he is! [chuckles] We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but... Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh... No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that? How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale? You know, you're right! We hadn't even thought of that, had we boy? [to Clark] [Takes picture from desk] Oh! You're a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clark's shoulder] You don't meet many hunters these days. [fumbling] Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they're not even good. Really, they're bad. Like you and your son. What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie? You're being disrespectful! [whispers to Clark] We don't get along. Terrible! Kevin! I heard that before... I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son. Maybe if you listened a little bit, you'd improve. No wonder women despise you. His last girlfriend was a tr*nsv*stite. I knew it right away. Adam's apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn't see it, or didn't wanna see it. Yeah? Like what? Really shameful... Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers. Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going "please kitty, may I have some more?" You can't make this stuff up! That's right. Hey. Okay. [banging on window] I don't get the point of this stupid window! Does that suit come with a f*re extinguisher? [Clark chuckles] Yeah, you don't want Italian. You'll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you'll be doing life in Rikers Island. That place doesn't exist. It's not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much? Yes! We did it! [leaving the suit store] And you closed it. The boys are back in town. [high fives Clark] High fives! Ha ha! You got me! [tickles Clark and chuckles] I used to collect them! Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you've got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? "Infuriating, irresponsible"... Got it. That's right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride. Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim's desk while he's away in Philly. Finally I'll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It's like, "Really, Jim? You don't understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses." Wow. Mm-hmm. Clark has no chance. I mean, he's up against my buddy Rolf, for God's sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor – he'll make you laugh so hard, you'll puke your pants. Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that's only gonna make things worse. No. You're interviewing for it. I'm getting it. I'm Rolf. Rolf Ahl. Go to hell. [chuckles] Nothing gets by this guy. Sure, yeah, go ahead. Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You're clean, right? Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don't listen to it at all because we're at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so— Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do. Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face. I need you to breathe in my face right now. What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen? I knew it, I knew it. Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party. Thank you. Damn it! Perfect answer, again. Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ... And anoth— No. It does, but still no. So why is this on your resume? [door slams] Dwight's my cousin, so I overheard him telling my brother Mose about the job opportunity in the shower. Everyone was in the shower. It's a cow shower, so there's like, a ton of people in there. You went to X-Men school too? [exhales] So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that'll print out—Hey. Meet your new desk mate. They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours. Oh, hey, I'll take a coffee. Aah! [pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me? Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work. Shh, shh. Shh. Remember your lines. Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount. [to Clark] You take off your glasses. My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra. [both laugh at Clark] Oh, come on! Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. [tries to embrace Erin but she begins playing cloppers] But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting. Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen. What?! No kidding? Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50. I've got the seat adjusted right. ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got? Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat. No. May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. [Andy leaves] Pete... This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it? [imitating Humphrey Bogart] I think this is a start of my first friendship. He worked as a librarian freshman year. So there's no marketing department. Hey, Moonface. Nice to see those shiny, little Chinese eyes of yours. I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant. Oh. I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat, little runt earlier. Phyllis! Me too. [holds up four fingers] Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey. Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um... Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles. Esther Ruger. [Angela makes a face in the background] Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres. Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me. [laughs] What do you think? A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship. Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer. Uh huh. Wow. That manipulates the secondary shaft. We should buy an auger together. Right, standard. No. No. I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate. What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off. Go on. No. What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now? Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me. Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy. [laughs] No! Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s—hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here. For five years I've held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it's time for me to just let that thought go. It's kind of painful, but it's also freeing in a way. Now it's all about my instincts. Pass. [fires tranquilizer g*n at Stanley] Man, he's really in twinkle town now. Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley's got way more body fat than they do. Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Let's go! He's like a manatee. Ready? Let's go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! [Stanley's head hits the door frame] Oh, God.  No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain. [grunts] Okay, we're good. We're good. Let's go. Push! I am! I might see a movie. What about you? [grunts] Let's take him— Let's go right to the top of the stairs, okay? Okay, listen. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I've never actually done this before. Thank you. I mean, I've rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh... [wraps tape around Stanley's body] Okay, now here's the plan. I'm gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him. Yeah. You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He's gonna be moving slowly. It's only— It's 15 feet down, it's at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it's like your catching a medicine— Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall. Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. We're running late. Let's get him inside. Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that's stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation. Thank you. Eh, you know, it really doesn't make sense to name the mice. They're kinda like cannon fodder, you know? You're not one of those PETA guys , are you? [cat jumps off dog] Oh, great. Well, I'll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters. Fine, let's go. [grunts] Hoist his shank on three. Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he's slouching. Okay, can you—sl-slouch him into the seat. [sighs] Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. [grunts] Got it? [grunts and closes car door] Get in the back. Get in the back. Get in. Helllloooo! Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we've got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson. He's fine. He gets carsick really easily. Good morning. I did. I got some really good sleep. I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now. She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent. Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink! [Snorts and grunts] I can't hear what you said. [snorting, grunting] You got your slop? [Squeals] I guess I will swallow my truth. Oh, Clark. I'm actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back. You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I'm here. Wow. Okay. The annex it is. I'll be sitting at your desk if that's okay with you. Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn't even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals. You did not just say that! You don't know Pam. She is really cool. Thank you, Jim. Get out of Jim's seat. Challenge number two, protocol. Clark? Do you want a corn dog? We'll see. You are an assistant who's just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message. Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl. Yes! Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental m*rder. That won't be necessary tonight. Ohh... Now, for the last time, I'd like a side salad with balsamic. Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental m*rder. That won't be necessary tonight. Ohh... Now, for the last time, I'd like a side salad with balsamic. Yup. Really great. When's she available? So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch... Oh, thank you. Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything. Okay. Okay. No, I mean, it feels... pressure. No. It just feels like pressure. Yup. Yeah. Perfect. We'll figure it out. Okay. Aw, thank you. Thank you.
