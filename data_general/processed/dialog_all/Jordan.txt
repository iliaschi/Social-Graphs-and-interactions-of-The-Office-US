Man, you're smart. [Erin arrives with new executive assistant] Oh, hey! Hi! Hello. Welcome. Uh, everyone, I'd like you to please welcome Jordan Garfield. This is everyone. So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before? Uh, a law office? Lame? You worked at Anthropology? That's like my dream job. How did you even get that job? So, umm, is this your first office job then? Well, there is no inner...circle. Really? Anything. And uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don't you sit underneath the basket? Yeah, come on. I'll dunk over you. Best seat in the house. How you doing, Jordan? Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly. [to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door] Uh, just put him through to me.
