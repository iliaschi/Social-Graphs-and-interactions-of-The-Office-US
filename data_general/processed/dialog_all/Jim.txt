Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy. It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay? The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man. Where? Give me that. Yes. Go get 'em. Sorry. It was really funny. Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a m*rder? Really safe. Thank you. Get whatever you want, on me. All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store. He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean. Yes, of course. What is this in reference to? Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight. I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video. Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing. They do call me that. Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor. Yeah. How ya doin'? Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building? Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers. Were you painting in the dark? I don't really think we need... Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim. Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed. We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success. No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible. What? Oh no, no, no. America is one big mall. [on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes. I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok. Tell me I'm good at sales. Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're "appearance"ists! Yeah, what happened Dwight? Yeah! I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out. Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...? That's great. Is he still doing his boycott? You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo. [fanfare] Go get 'em Dwight. 00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards. It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal. Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge. You work on commission, don't you? No, we don't. Of course, but he looks much less threatening now. Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir! You made a big mistake. Huge! Aaah! Andy? [Andy starts boombox and begins singing 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd'] Hey, how are those salads? Yes! Yeah. You all made it, thank you so much. Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine! We can relax. Sounds like Cece. [sees Erin holding Cece] Oh, my God! Go, go! I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home. Why are you here? I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything. Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want. Okay. Thank you. This night was a disaster. Yeah? Get it. Let's get our juice on. Yeah! My last physical when I was forty. What, is it because he's black? Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia. [Kevin is grossed out immediately. The office is grossed out] Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise. Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike. Come on, Michael! Yeah! Not the car! How do I look? Normal. Ugly. We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash. Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending. And who is this "the" Steve Nash? No. No, Mr. Jock Hipster. Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists. Danny Cordray is the worst. The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone. Also, he slept with Pam. No, he didn't. [Dwight mouthing "yes, he did"] Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again. That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle. No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. [Jim nodding repeatedly] You know I have a kid with you, right? I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay? Watch this. Hey, Dwight. Good to see you. Jim, hey. Like hell you are. Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea-[cell phone rings] Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello? It's Jim, Okay? Yes. You need the big g*n, yes? What'd he say? What did he say? Oh, no, that's a male model. Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two-- Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then. Jim talked too much. What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy. You know what this is? This is a stinger. Like the movie. Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers. Thanks, hun. Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you. Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire k*ller. Shhh! Hey! That's my mug. Testify. So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too. We gotta get someone else in there right now. That sounds fake. I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father- Okay. Then make him pitch to you. We gotta see what he's got. Okay, and remember-you're not gay. Okay. Uh, Manuel, cleano el window. Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in- No, no, no.... No! We're not- Gotcha. [they go into Michael's office] Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates. Yeah. Way ,way, way back. Oh. She was not into me. You snubbed her. Thank you. What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now. I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours. People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings! [has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me. I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on. [places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye! Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam. We were basically Romeo and Juliet. Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates. But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor. And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please? Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party? [removes teeth] Creed's going?! Can you imagine? It's just crazy. Exactly. No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so... Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back? Hey. This is some party, huh? Are you serious? You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and... Halpert, you lookin' for someone to bang your wife? I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it. Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago? Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky. No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company. Oh, wow! That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what- NO, no, no. They will cost you your life. Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger. Yes. I would welcome it. Cece's getting christened today. Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that. But I'm the Godfather. Are you talking to me? [looking at Cece's diaper] Somebody needs a change. Well, she can't bring this up with her. Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip. [seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What? Honey, no. No, no. We have an extra outfit in the bag. You said you checked it. Before we go, I'd like to remind everyone that the "Halberts" have been kind enough to host a reception next door immediately following the service. Mm. No. Wrong on both counts. I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people. I'm Doug Mcpherson, Davey's uncle. Davey. [to Cece] Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you. I don't know. I'm just hungry. [holding up an empty serving dish] What was this? You're out of it. Who the heck was that? We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas. No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month. [standing in the church sanctuary, talking to the stained glass] Why you always got to be so mean to me? I don't know. I lost the purse too. No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus. Jim, Jim, I want to give a toast. Where's the little girl of honor? I don't mean to bug, but do you know when those subs are due into port? I got a hungry bunch of Mcphersons over there. I think maybe some blonde lady had her. Smaller than me. [holding the baby, walks up to Jim] Hi, honey. I was just changing the baby. [walks up] Honey. Did you think I stole your baby? Did you lose Cece? It's pronounced wacko. [obviously faking being serious the whole time] Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat! [walking with Jim and Pam] Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life. Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe. [pours powdered seahorse into his wine glass] Jim what are you doing? Flip it back please. [grimacing] That's what she said. [leaves] It's a miracle. She loves him. I do. But you married my worst enemy. From Jim. Do it! [referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth. I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading. I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced. Yeah sure, Jim could go see her. You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues. [to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please. [as the power and lights come back on] My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet. Uh... try "password". Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero. Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one. Um, everyone was getting their driver's license. You're typing "Big Boobs"? Try "Big Boobs" with a "Z". So, uh... [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales. [on phone] All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. [hangs up the phone and rubs his eyes] Whoo! [Erin jumps in the background] Commission comes out to... dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero. You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero. Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love? When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean? Nudity makes me uncomfortable. No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles. Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now? Did you prank Dwight? Well, you like that. I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own. [singing] But it just may be a lunatic... [stops singing] No. Hey, kid--hear you're looking for work. Can you at leasttryto look busy? [Jim Exhales] Thank God. Now, I love reading, and I hate being interrupted. Shut up and listen, you gay bastard. Chapter One. I was born, not into luxary, nor poverty. [Gabe looks through Jo's book] But into adversity, and for that, I thank the Lord. My Father was a man. That's all we can know. After I learned to ride a bike, there was no stopping me. I would ride up Magnolia Stree and down Azalea Lane. Which would later become my-- [picks up pencil between his toes] [typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear. [lifts cup up with toes] [spills hot coffee on himself] Uhh, aah! Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner. "Which is you" is not a sentence. Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar? Suck it Oscar. So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours? Not really, because I found one. Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room. Good. Actually, it was. Sure. Coffee Jim. It is not just coffee. Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary. Pass. I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs. Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II. I don't need to cheat. I lied about some aspects of the building. There's no building... it doesn't exist. I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna... Fail. I don't want to fail... again. And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales. Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it? People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one. One, two, three. [everyone jumps] Still some people not jumping. It hardly looks fake. It's so lush. I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking. [mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful. Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here! You apologize to me right now. You apologize right now. Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter. Okay. Hey. Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year. I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good. I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking. Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! [dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off] [as Marge] Oh, Homey. [they both laugh] What kind of g*n do you have? Six-sh**t? [turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally] Oh, no. Oh, no! Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath! Huh? You like that? Huh? Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone. Oh, Jim. Hey. There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse... Who looks exactly like you. Yeah. No, it's uncanny. What? I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress. Why would anyone frame you for that? [laughs] I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids... Okay, hey, hey, hey... Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something? [Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe. Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it] [lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God. I love it. Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that. Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder. Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] "The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert." Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter. Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall. I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent. You h*t Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch. Hey, sorry. I'm ready. Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker] I'm sorry. I had no idea. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. What? Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey! Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels. One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us. What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader's voice] Dwight, don't be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim. Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim. Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them. Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag. It was pretty cool. It was pretty awesome. Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best. Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous. No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy, If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night. I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at. What's going on? Do you know that guy? Hey. I played "ape." You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close. [entering conference room] [as Mikanos] What is taking that guy so long? I don't know. They're still in there. Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom. And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group. And Tom... And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence. Right. But how'd you say it? Hey, you think it's cool if I grab a soda? Hey. How's it goin'? It's been a while. So you work here, huh? Must be a front for some kind of famous laboratory. [laughs] 'Cause you're so smart. Oh, barely. I'm so dumb, you know, stuff goes in, stuff goes out. Not like you probably remember every paper sale you ever made. Paper salesman genius. Yeah. And who is on my side? [no one raises their hand] Bye. I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you. Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny "Jim" game. All right, what'd you do? Where'd you put it? Let's go. Say it. Where? The fridge. The fridge, got it. Let's go! Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts. Just drive faster. I want to get back. Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit. No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim? I need to pee. Yeah, I do. My word against yours. What part of "I need to pee" do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car. Well I hope I make it. Hi Jim, it's Helen. Everything is fine. Baby's fine. She has a tiny fever. I'm taking her for a check up. Nothing to worry about. A tiny thing. I locked her in the car. She's smiling. She's happy. Jim, I don't have a spare key. This is Pam. What's wrong? Jim, what? Oh God! What?! Ok. She's ok? Understood. Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a "Ask Pam Beasley". ... Did the phone cut off? Alright, just call me after the doctor. I jus... I just need a signature. How much did you give him? Wait. I don't have my scarf. I'm missing my scarf. Oh. [both laugh] [loudly] Yeah, lunch was wonderful! Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there? Yes. Never found that bottom, did we? Andy. Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat] You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine. Oooh. They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife. Yeah! That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right? You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him. Sorry. No. No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here. That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die. Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office. Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed. I just told them to do it! No. That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth. We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie. [Jim, with his face painted with metallic gold paint] Oh someone's coming alright, the only man who would care. [Goldenface turns in his chair, holding a golden g*n] Michael Scarn. See I'm gonna lure him here, then I k*ll everybody, then... I'm gonna dig up Scarn's dead wife, and I'm gonna hump her real good. [malicious, deep laughter] [as a drunken man in the bar] If doing The Scarn is gay, then I'm the biggest q*eer on Earth! [turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains] We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states. Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why? No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken sl*ve! Jim will be made a w*rlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months. Could be. I can see that happening, yes. That's a realistic time line. Perhaps. I can see that as a very real possibility. I can see that happening. Whoa! Yes! Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff. Awwh, you're welcome. [they hug] My pleasure. I just helped someone out. It feels good. Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk. Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair! That's how he gets you to take off his panties. Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done? [to Jim] So you two are married to each other now, right? That's sweet. How's the sex? 'Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife. I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Viva A Fox. [winks] [interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second? None of your business. It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this. Really. I know. Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate. [mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff? Who is Justice Beaver? Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that? [to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper] eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point- Well thanks, will do. That sounds weird. [also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World. What are you doing? I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why? He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him. People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1. What is this? Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes? That's a common swindlers trick. So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs] Jim, put those away. just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans? She's the one. How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.' It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring. Where was that. At a gas station? Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever. I know but I'm still scared I don't know why. You were scared? Nice. Can't really tell the... I know right...[sees Jim's beans] what the? That... that's impossible. All right, I'll take them. Probably. [walks away with beans] This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives. Congratulations! Yep. But, no, but we are a family. Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss! Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable. Da-das. You know what, enough about your baby, ok? I'm sorry. Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot. No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No. You'll figure it out. That's a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable. Very cute. See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand. Congratulations! You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards! [holds up a camera and DeAngelo meows] Here we go! Have Pam come down. What's going on? Uhhh, you sir! [points to Jim] Are we having fun tonight? Oh good! No, no, no! This is the performance of your life! THE DUNDIES! Get away from the car, he's gonna see you. [desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in! Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time? What? Thank you Jim. [Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records? Fall asleep right after sex. Huh guys? There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! [Dwight plays a celebratory honking noise on his keyboard] Well done. You didn't think to mention me huh? Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please? So what you're saying is you kinda like it? [Phyllis impression] I've fallen and I can't get up! [normal again] That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good. That got a big laugh. In costumes! [Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies. [weak] Hi Tuna. I'm going to! Nah, I'm almost done. I know... go big, or go home. You go with This guy, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life, OR, the biggest, Good decision of your life. It's either gonna be the best thing you ever did, or the worst thing you ever did. If you want some boring, white bread clock-watcher who's gonna get you your paper when you ordered it, for the agreed upon price, [Andy looks hopeful] Andy's not your guy. [Andy deflates] You ever play Russian Roulette? [scoffs] Time to spin the chamber horse. By signing up for another year. [hands the client a folder he needs signed for another year's contract] [looks at the clock to see it is three o'clock] Jim where is Pam? [the office looks up expectantly] Ummm... Hm... No. [changing his mind] No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. [walks out and then back in, now using a Vietnamese accent] Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! [the office groans] And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! [only Kevin is laughing. Stanley tries to leave. Michael hugs him] I ruv you all! I ruv you very much! Sure. [Ping accent] Be right out! [sad] Ohh... [holding back tears] Okay... Maybe. Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing? [pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man... Oh, okay. [hears a taxi honking] Oh sh**t! That's my cab. Alright. I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright? I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am. [entering his office] Hey dudes! Oh my God, he hates me! I know. Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings? Oh, there's an inner circle. Oh yeah. [sh**t mini basketball at hoop on office door, misses badly] Is that ball lighter than usual? Is that a Chinatown knockoff? Yes. Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes [starts to run out of the break room] yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes! What's wrong with juggling, Darryl? I'm a big juggler. I actually perform a motivational juggling routine. [imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling b*lls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands. What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him? [to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it? Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office? And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye. Snip snip. Am I right, girls? So what's up? Yeah sure. Let's make it a meeting. [Darryl, Kevin, Gabe enter office] What's the big secret? Why are you even whispering? Come on, it's the guys! Hot! Damn! Are you serious? Who feels this way? Umm, Pam? Guys. Hold on. Doesn't matter who, okay? I'm just happy that Jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had - I had no idea. Absolutely. [heading into Deangelo's office] Jim, you coming? Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand. At least he likes one of us. Internally, for office use [Jim quietly enters Deangelo's office and sits down] where do we get our paper from? Do we go - [staring at Jim] Hey Jim. Can I help you? So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh? Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief. Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market. Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week. Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project. Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles -- You're back in. Yeah, we'll set that up one day. Yeah, I don't know. Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership. Seems a little close, you sure that's the real foul line? Nah, that's 15. Yeah. Okay, Jimmy, this is for you. Show you that anything is possible. Alright? This is also for the troops. [backs up, bounces ball, starts running, jumps, lands in front of Kevin, jumps again, pulls himself up by the net, dunks ball, hangs on rim] Doctor is in! [hoop starts to fall] Ahhhh! [hoop crashes down on Deangelo] [speaking gibberish] Tablab. Who should I say is calling? That's true. Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand] Nope. Baskets have it. So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high. [on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently] Can't stay there all day. Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy? You'd slow me down. [quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection. Define foment. [seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist? You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion? Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist. I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him. Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The g*n is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue. The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business. Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior. Don't make me f*re you. Don't make me pre-f*re you. Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired. What? Okay. Thank God. What's jazz hands? Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down. Yep. Who is it? Shut up. [running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed... We need a new manager. Absolutely--I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits. Yeah. How would we know that, if you don't... I guess I could be, if I was... who would do that? Tell you what. I'll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part. Color-code sent documents, TM. That's a verbal trademark. That's an agreement. Can you do any better on salary? What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain't cheap, you know. No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim] Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me. That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim? [more emphatically than Jim] Yes. You do. [nods at the Search Committee, then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face] Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk. Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job. [noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that? I... I just thought you knew me. Well, I'd want to move further away, you know? Just... I don't want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office. [pulls out a tupperware from his briefcase and takes out a tupperware] I'm leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really. [opens tupperware] You know, all of 'em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just... I had to get outta there. [begins eating sandwich] Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified. I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course. [happily] Uh, 93 million miles. Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way. [walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family? Good. They good? What's your daughter's name again? Peepee? Peepa, how is she? Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim? Now, listen,... Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel. I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam... Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment. Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back] Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this. Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim] So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim] Hope it's all right. The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do? Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about. Yes. How did he do? Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke. Everyone would be known for their accomplishments. By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle. Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor. Is there a front runner? Well, there must be someone who stands out. My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves] You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves] Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning? I have no idea. [mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager. [again] Assistant Regional Manager. [in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager. Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight. [whispers] Yeah. That's f***ing crazy. [Jo and Dwight both smile] Get outta here. [Dwight leaves] What a nutjob. Okay, it's fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who's got ya excited? It's not. Let's get Kelly in here to take his place. 'Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong. I'm doing an opposites thing. How'd my girl Nellie do? She didn't mention it? Integrity move. I like it. Hmm. Dwight Schrute. You have to interview me... I demand more questions! Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it. What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique g*n was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing. Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves] [sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed. I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel. Yeah, it was a great deal. Well, we could try him out for a little while... [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in... Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager? He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me. That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet. Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad. Tuna... You're completely sane. Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice? Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure? Can I say...? I think it should be Darryl. I want an outsider. I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties. No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles] It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now? Then what was this all about? I don't care. They can just vote. I insist. I don't think I should. Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly] I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I'm telling someone how to do somethin'. I go on with a long description and then I say, "and shove it up your butt." It's stupid, but it's my thing now. [starts attacking plankers] Kids, don't try planking. It's dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] ‘Specially with me around. Because everything makes me cry, so what's the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone. Not enough though. Jim. [motions him over] What are you looking at? Yeah, it can't be nothing. What? No. We need a warning signal. We do. Okay, which side of the list am I on? Yes! Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work. Maybe it's a list of people he's gonna f*re. I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side's the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam. Maybe we're s'posed to do it with people in our group. People in the other group. No, it's not. Here's how we find out. Let's line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let's just size each other up here and left side of the list... att*ck! That's great. Let's do this guys. I love you so much. [starting to cry] Okay. [turns to computer] Okay. Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street? Sesame street. Elmo, god's sake, it's the Elmo era. Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn't you agree. I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone. Jim, shut the door. This is just gross. Night. Yes. Me do. Alright. Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital. But save time. More success. Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world. See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China. I'm sorry," L"? How on earth are we supposed to sell...? Justine. She said she's coming by later. Nah man, we get along now. Real well. Double.[Andy knocks on Jim's desk] What's up, guys? Just thought we'd have a little rap session, talk about business...see how things are going? Ahem... If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You're not making any sense. You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna. Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici's favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies. Of course. Great.[Angela walks away] That's a tablecloth. That's a crazy amount of points. Well, what do you want? Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work. [laughter] Really? Swear to God, hope to die. Now let's get to work! Yeah! Whoo! [Group cheers] [hands Jim folder] Ask for Donald, Karen's bananas. T-bag bone... Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here? [On the phone] You've got to unleash the power of the Pyramid! You think it has something to do with that incentive program? Bah...I think people thought I was kidding when I said that. Hundred and twenty points. Yes! [adds receipt to growing pile and thumbs up Andy.] Just need a second outside. Yeah. I don't know what I'm doing. My ass is only so big, I mean I can't do this everyday. No one expects me to go through with this, right? [removes tape to reveal tattoo of puppy] It's a Nard Dog! [group cheers] That's my nickity-name! I love it, I love it! You can't leave a dog in a parked car. [points to "I'd rather be snowboarding" bumper sticker] Snowboarder, it figures. OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on. This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window. [Oscar approaches the vehicle with a tire iron] Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers] And one for good measure! [Busts out taillight, group applauds] Why would we take the dog? Nein. Sits. [snaps as dog calms] Goot. [Oscar pokes holes in cardboard now taped over window] There we go. That should do it. That'll work. What's that come to? Like, what did they each win? At least. I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] "Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug." And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids? And then my handsome husband... Would bring me a flavored coffee. Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters. Jim! How 'bout you? That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl. Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift] [On all fours with a box on his back] OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back. Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday. [Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence. Like baboons or elephants. Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh. So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings.... And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France. Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy. Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again? Message in a Bottle, The Postman... Kevin Costner. You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it! It's not the greatest one either... And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in sh*t showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor] I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim? OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them. Jim? Tell them what it's called. No Jim, tell 'em what a name is. [laughing] Señor Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim. No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Señor Loadenstein. We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-w*r brownstone at the top of a mountain. Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world. Just like now. Oh.. How'd it look? What? [Stanley enters office laughing] Morning, Stanley. Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it. It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time. And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you. They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by. I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret w*apon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs] MR. RYAN HOWARD! I'm Walter, Andy's younger brother. Tuna, right? And this must be your lovely wife Pam [looking at Meredith]. Hell no. She wishes. Set that down. [grabs waitress] Present yourself. Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper. What are they doing? Nice touch. Who cares. MR. JAMES HALPERT! Stop forgetting things. MR. JAMES HALPERT! What? Idiot. MIS... MI... What are you doing? Put it on, man. Three Kings. Alright. ...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black. No! My wife does not believe in ghosts. Hey! What do you mean? I saw a ghost. It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date. [answers phone] Pam Halpert. Is it called Ghostbusters? It didn't look like that. Ok fine I'll draw him. [hangs up phone and draws] Try a box jelly fish. What are we talking about? I grew this party up real fast. Get out of here little kid party. Nobody loves you. And clean up your room! Grownups are going to use it later! Oooh! I'm using it. I'm about to play Starcraft with him [points to Dwight]. Yeah I'm serious. I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person. Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical? Really. Exactly. [to camera] What am I up to? I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim. I'm not gonna lie to her, either. One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer. End the mistakes. That is all I ask. [gets up from chair] And you can't have a favorite Iron Chef. It depends entirely on the secret ingredient. Sometimes I feel you don't know food at all. Nahh! [shakes head] No. Not Justine. Never Justine. Oh yeah. P.S. We should should k*ll him. No, it's an accountability booster. Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger] No questions. Accountability booster. Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like...z64$8. [incorrect password] Not that exactly Jim, something like that. How about Scrantonstrangler666. Wha...what's Dwight's mothers name. Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something. Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash. I'll see you next week Will. [at the club, playing squash] Jim what are you...What a surprise. Yeah. A game or a match? Good policy. Sensible. Smart. In the box. Isn't it supposed to be, "Drive safely"? Sounded like mine. Well, it's mine. You took it out of my bag. Can I have it? Yep. [censored beep] ha, Jesus. Nah, it's good. Yeah. It's the standard one. The one everyone has. It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting? Take it easy. Nice and easy. Oo! You alright? Skinned knee. Oo, a little ice on that maybe. Hey – asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single? You doubt it? Why do you doubt that she's single? Hey. Helen Mirren. Hot? Huh. What about Cathy? Yeah. Do you think she's hot? I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive? You don't find Cathy attractive? No, I don't. Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake. Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single. I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas? Mike Tibbets, really? Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive? Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z. Yep. Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch] I'm fine, I'm totally fine. Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim. Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again] I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance. [to Jim] Oh, that line from Zoolander? It was from a deleted scene so we were both right. [to Jim] Yeah? Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it. Come on. [mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs. Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert? [mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten. Jim, are you serious? Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we? Do you find Cathy Simms attractive? Ah, see, was that so hard? Really? Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure? When was the last time you went to the doctor? Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you? It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man. But... hey, Cece's toothbrush. Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness! Never cry wolf. Oh! Oh my goodness! I'm really in labor! This is happening! Oh! And one for you. Whoa, where you going? Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists. Thank you. Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought. Exactly. Now do you know the Civil w*r soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he d*ed. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? [holds up flag] I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars. Spangler Springs is a mile this way. Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there. I guess he follows orders. Even without an audience you're still at it. Our office has a disease. And it goes by many names. Sarcasm. Snark. Wisecracks. You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes. That's what you did with this trip. You don't like the hats? Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never h*t the sweet spot. [to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums] What are you doing? Give that back. Come on! Oh that's real creative. I could, but I just don't feel like it loser. Standing. Don't! Standing. [signing his name] Andrew... Baines... Bernard. What was that? Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let ‘er rip. What do you hate about this place? Jim? Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know. That's Gerald. [hands phone to Jim] It's not that kind of ladle. Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this. [sees Jim's abandoned car] That's weird. Well, he's gotta be around here somewhere. Okay. What about your friend? So I think you know what we want to know. Yes. Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness. For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here? That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day. Jim... Answer the question, please. All right. Thanks. I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas. So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is. Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time? Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye. It wasn't either of you. I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm] Hey! Hey! Respect the hat! Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay. Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person. I will look so handsome for you, Darryl. Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room] Wow. [on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye. Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was att*cked by this blood thirsty rabid creature! Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up? Hello? Lacerated hand here folks. Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA. Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it. Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand? No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs. Come down right away! Yes, I was quilled. Henrietta. I was too embarrassed! [group laughs] Is that Cici? Oh my god. How could somebody do that? Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this? Dwight? Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is f*re-able. It's, I mean. That's no accident. What? Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as sh*ts show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!! You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends? Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends? No...I don't, hmm, I don't know. By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work. Alright, I'll tell Dwight. Christmas miracles do happen. Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?  I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. [takes another bite] Oh yeah! You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane. I'ma love you downstairs tonight... [overlapping chatter] [writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper? [gasps] Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause] There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia. It's trivia. But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase... Yeah? You like it? All right. And you guys thought this was a good idea? A-team. Okay. [leaves] Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine. That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington. All right, boards up. Let's see who got it. "Lamar Odom" is what we were looking for. "Lamar Odom" Thank you. [scattered cheers] All right, guys. After nine rounds, let's check the scores. In first place, with nine points, it's Aesop's Foibles. [Oscar's team touches fingers] The Queerenstein Bears have seven points. [a team of hairy men growl] Dunder-Mifflin A-Team has four points. Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs] Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim. My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but... I'm selling the house, actually. It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, sex, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. [Jim laughs] Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim? What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard? [to Jim] Hey, late guy. Oh. DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight. You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine. You should see the whole thing. I'm just about to give the tour. Join us. You must see what you were laughing about. And Gabe-y makes three. Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it. I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan. I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears. And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness. To madness. Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl. Yes! Woohoo! Bravo! Hey! Tuna! He's back. Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap. [grabs Jim's wrist] Hand roll. How was jury duty? What was the case? Did you send him to the slammer? Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] "Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm." Not coming, have plans. Okay. Oh, I'd love to but, um- Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets? Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change. Yeah. I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story. You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's. So this whole h*t and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop... And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane? See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert! Yes! Andy, get out here. That's good enough for me. [exhales again] I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before. No, not after what I told Dwight about f*ring you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up? Do you know why you never heard of it? Covered it up. Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar? It's the empanada guy. Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets. Why? Why? [looks at Jim] We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down? I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your [bleep]. This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow. What? What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt. You won't see- [to Cece] You want a giraffe? Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here. Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you! Oh, hi Stanley. Jim. Hi everybody! How about a little visit? All right. No, but that would've been a really good idea. No, she brought you drawings. Oh! Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style? Shh. [cries] Mama, mama, mama. Oh, it's okay, sweetie. It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay. I don't know what that means. We're gonna circumcise him. No! I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier. Okay, we're going. Shh, shh, shh. You want to grab her? Here we go, here we go. [groans] We'll see you tomorrow. Hey, we'll be just fine.  So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So- ...we wanted to say thank you- I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque. Kathy. Why? Does he think you're going to Florida? Well, let's hear it. I like it so far. It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida. Total golf text. Send it. Ok, read it back to me. Absolutely. Works for me. Well done. And we managed to k*ll the entire morning. Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good. I think you need to go to Florida. It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be.. I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need? I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much. Jim is essential to th- Andy, Jim is just too...essen-... This is stupid! Cut. He doesn't even want to go. Oh my god. Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer] Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says "I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt" unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight's forehead] oh. What was that? So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate. Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store. Right. Think different, from Apple. Alright [kiss] Bye. Call me when you land. Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. [sees Dwight] Oh, not cool! Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees "IT WAS DWIGHT" written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream] Cool, for your kids? Who says none of us are diarrheal? Very funny, Jim. I'm gonna set your face on f*re. Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod. You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins. Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. [ringing continues] Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service? How was the drive? Life is short. "Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse." That's one of my mottoes. Quick query, Halpert. You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping penis? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping penis is right here, [points to her head] and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my penis. [slow clap] I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. [points to Jim] After you decided I wasn't "a good fit-" Uh. [eats antacids] You didn't poison me, it's just stress. What is the antidote? [on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use? Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over! It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate. It's whatever you want. [offers Jim the bottle] Or do you only drink with your kids? Ah, let's do it. [laughs] Oh, that's healthy. Jim, are you in? Sounds like a hoot. I'm in. Dwight? [groans] Stop moving! Arrest Jim. He poisoned me. Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning. What's our presentation about? I want that vice-presidency. Aw, let him do it. Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim? Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or- That's a hobby, unless it's for food. Waste of time. That's just a verb. Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real 'Talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about. Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' [chuckles] no, no, no, no... Oh, you get kicked. Well, that's how I played it in college. Oh, that is lovely. Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.[Cathy knocks on Jim's door and Jim answers] Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here? Okay, yeah. Cool... [Jumps onto bed] Is this March Madness? I love March Madness. LeBron James. No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.[Knock at the door] My mini bar is oddly out of rum. Oh, hello. [laughs with Cathy] Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier. mm-hmm. [about to leave] uh-huh. You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] ...ahhmmm... excuse me... What?! Not now, I'm busy. Where did you see it? Describe it. Could be a bat weevil... Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy? Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured? Pshh. That's a bedbug. Everything's a joke. Check your hair! [checks Jim's hair] God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this. You are clean. Okay... One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh] Is this really nessecary? Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower. We wait. [Shower starts] Come to papa. Oh.[Packer and Nellie are speaking softly to each other. Gabe sprays his inhaler into Packer's drink.] Nope, I wasn't bitten. Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect. If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me. No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long. No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first. Such a chorus girl. Yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster... Okay, cool. Thanks... I know, I'm a pig, right? [giggles] Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously. Oh my God, what are you thinking? I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me? Can you... without running to the other side of the room all night? Okay. [Sits next to Jim.] I am so cold. Hey, just so you know, me and you... I don't think that's ridiculous... Dot, dot, dot... dot, dot.[Jim walks into his room to find a bathrobe on the floor] What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right? [wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug? [coughs and moans] Oh stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop it! [runs out the door] You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy. Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had. [at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight? Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I h*t rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn't even get a callback. The black one. I never stood a chance. Okay. I wasn't really sure which one of you is Chuck. This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog. Are you trying to sabotage this entire event? We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? "Hello. Hi sweetie. It's Jim. I'm calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape." Sabre. It's time to come home. You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea. On my God. You're so embarrassing.  My mom would say the best stuff, though. And you know that I'm capable of this. What did you think of the presentation? How long has he been in the bathroom? Jeez! What's he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates] Are there any bloggers around? I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy! You are gonna bloody ruin it. You're gonna bloody ruin it because you're a no-good half-assed cock-eyed... Jim -- Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I'm telling you... if you don't do this, [whispers] I don't stand a chance. Please, Jim. Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan's costume and check out his notes. Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long? Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner? You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.[Coldplay's Clocks] It's true. Yep. Psst. [applause] All right.  Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues] [to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh] Don't even care! Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked. Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win. [drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart] I'll let Dwight have his fun. Today will not be his day. I'm gonna t*nk the Sabre store at the presentation to the board. Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers. But, there's a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim? [Jim shakes head] They're cheap. They're unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone's wives do us. You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper. What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you? What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh] Different guy. [interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh] [on phone with Jim] He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna f*re him. Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this. Did you actually try your hardest? Don't talk to me. If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do. [straightens tie in mirror] Showtime. You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick. Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money? [rolls eyes] Jim, come on. Uh-huh. Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna k*ll the store? And he's gonna f*re me? [smiles] That's two things. Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today. You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye. [Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help! AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest. [attempting to break from Jim's grasp] Ah! [clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix- My wound hasn't healed yet. Oh, man! [trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs] I was trying to go- Ok, ok. Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you. No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie] This. Ends. Now. [picks Jim up] Rrahh! [both fall] Anything else you need to talk about? Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida? [to Jim] Hey, stranger! Aw, I missed you. Well, I guess it doesn't look that cool either. But, it's been up there a long time, so it's become a pretty big deal. I was still thinking of going back to school. k*ll the balloon. k*ll the balloon. k*ll the balloon. k*ll the balloon. k*ll the balloon. [pops loudly] [cheers and applause] Allow me to solve your problem, then. Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie? That one looks empty. Not much we can do about this until he gets here. Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim. -Right. So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo? You didn't even stop to pee? Gross. [answering Andy's phone] Proctology. Jim? He's here in Tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down. What do you mean, take my job? Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later. I like working here. Those who can't farm, farm celery. Six percent, I know my worth. Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive. I am not. Huh. Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown? Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss. Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor? When two animals are having sex, one of them... ... is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua-- this isn't very helpful. You're gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor. All life is sex. And all sex is competition. And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it? My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is? Oh, great. Jim, time for your review. Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise? Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell? I'm Tinkerbell. But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist. She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell? I do. [applause] Come on everyone... I already spent the money. Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card? It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache. Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this! [bell dings] Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him? Yep. I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible? I'm still not sure why this woman is even here. [lifting box] Ugh! Ow. Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? "Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is." Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic. Hey, what's up? [shouting] Haulin' cube! So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad. No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card. What? I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account. [finds shoe box] Ooh. I have to see these shoes. Oh! Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend. Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend. You read my mind. Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician. [walks in] Oh. Why not call... That's awful. What kind of restaurant. I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one? Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this. God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician? What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you. Jim, could you give us a hand? Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam d*ed. [laughter] So we've established- Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you're my volunteer. Come on over here, huh? no, Nellie, she- Oh! Big guy, huh? How's the air up there? Watch out for... birds. [chuckles] All right, let's uh- let's do some card magic. Now, what I want you to do is... I want you to pick a card just by looking at it. Do not say what it is. Little known fact about me. Before I was a magician, I used to work at a rope factory. Yes ma'am. I got my eyes open. Let's just- let's go. Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley. You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain? Lots of things are cozy in the rain. Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have. Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl. Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby. Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love? Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog? Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it. That a couple of times- Yeah Jim, get it out there. Okay, stop. Ooh, ooh! Boo! Ugh. Eww! You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul? "Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches." "He is a drifter out to sea." It's just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft... Smokey Robinson Pam. He d*ed like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know. Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now. Okay well, that's a relief! Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go! Yeah... Who's opening? Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this. What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it. I know! We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it. Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote. Whoa! Are you-- Twice! For real? Life is Downton Abbey. [Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So? Hm-hmm. Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes! Well, Dwight, yes! You certainly are a record breaker! Your donation is the largest we've ever received at over 34 thousand dollars! [applause] Yeah, you never get used to that. He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse. Absolutely, it's awesome-- Maybe you would think it too! [silence.] I'm sorry, it's just I don't get to be in a lot of human conversations. Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on! Yeah, I do. I have that. Core's critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One – lengthen. Two – elongate. Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who's the strongest? Well, there's only one way to solve that – flat curl contest. I love the burn. The burn is where I live. Speed set. One. Two. Oh, thank you. Five. Six. Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over] I don't need your help. Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they're rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it's a little much? ...Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that's what it feels like. Good, we have a deal? Thanks so much Earl. And they said it couldn't be done. Boom! Lot going on guys. What's happening? That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It's like a festival of poo. Yeah, and we're not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes. No, Jim, the butt, in his butt. Shh... shh... [vomits in trash can] You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one's that guy? Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to – how do I put this – steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud. Yes. They're New York. We're New York. Sate line is the dividing line. That's the way it's always been. Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside] Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first. Damn it! Wha – what is this supposed to be? Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It's got a hula skirt and a blue nose. What? It's him! Do something! Get out! Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That's it? Oh, that's great. That's like a five second delay. Come on, let's go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? h*t the nos. Yeah. h*t the nos. Yes. Got it. Go. [Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator] Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh. Ah! [Harry walks in] Go, go! Take the stairs! Now! Just run! Take the stairs! I'll stall him. Go! I'm gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We'll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down. No, no, it's not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. It's... Big Red Paper Company. Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst? Jim couldn't land me in a thousand years. So what would you do if you weren't selling paper? What? Nothing? I'd like to sell one big thing, you know? Like... a plane. One sale, I'm out. Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them. I know why you're doing this, Dwight. [Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim! [wearing janitor outfit] Hi guys. [whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you? Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping. [enters with the kids] Family picture! What? Honey, we talked about this. Yes, and then we decided that was crazy. No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember? We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child. No, no. But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them. Yes! And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y. Yeah? Okay. Oh, great. Thank you. Okay. You ready? There we go. I'll just stand here? Sir, could you look into the camera? Sir. Up here. [whistles] Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good. I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine. I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back! Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum "Suck It" to the U.S. m*llitary. Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. [drinks coconut penis energy drink] Why'd they add coconut? I miss original. Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place. For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great. Kay, well, you had that interesting thing. Yes, Jim's friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college. And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too. He said if it takes off he's gonna buy us a new car. And that was our summer. No thank you. My name's Pete. Jim, get ready for the battle of your life. The new guys. Dwight Jr is after my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub. Wait, sales—what sales meeting? The new guys called a sales meeting? There's no belt above black. Is there a belt above black? That's me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete's foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack. Sure, boxing, tennis. NASCAR. The Amazing Race. You mean horses? Ah, I like the Red Sox. I'm from Vermont. Ok. Good talk. Well, I'm still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list. You ready? Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I'm about to prove it. Dwight Schrute! A wheel wants to spin, Pam. [referencing the ‘tiny wheel'] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore] [exiting house] Thanks, mom! Yeah. I'm afraid he's only gonna have hot dogs. Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs. Ah, thank you! [embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel] [as Jim receives and declines a call] Who's that? [sarcastically] Ha-ha. Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. [wads up Nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her] Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice. Are you kidding? Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a b*llet on that one. [sees Jim's reaction] Just kidding. Thanks...aw. Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it'd take off? Yeah. What about you? What are you doing? Oh, cool. Hey bro, stop wasting time with this haircut. [referring to Jim] He's got a fifty-thousand dollar sports car. Cheers. So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you. [approaches piano] [in the car] We still surprise each other. You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with- Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was- In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] Do we know everything about each other? Tell me one thing about you I don't know. [laughs] Um, ok. [thinks but says nothing] And you thought you guys were millionaires. Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember. Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. sh**t, I knew that one. The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next. [Oscar chokes on his coffee] [whispering] John Stamos. Uh-huh. [as Pam wonders about Jim] Kevin, stop it with that question. [in the stairwell on his phone] Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow! Yeah, right? OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there. OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago- I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he h*t on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know. Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me. [looks knowingly back] Just tell me. Fake Who are you?Fake You're not Jim. Jim's not AsianFake Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?Fake How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!Fake 30.Fake [to Jim] I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch. You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ‘em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching. There he is! You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon! Good. Good. And—[Nellie hits the car against the bushes] I'm done. I gotta get out of here. It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets. Like what? What kind of job? Hell yeah! That sounds awesome! I love Philly! It's not even a thought— What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man! And Pam's into it? Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real. Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I—Nellie, this is brilliant! [sees Jim] Hey! Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this. Fail! Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK? Oh that wasn't...that didn't work. That was not the right..[Group protests] [Jim rushes to open door for her] Thank you. You got it. [to Jim] What are you doing? You popped one kernel. Correct. I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way. Had 'em all my life. No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim. [scoffs] Yeah right. [Dwight moves mouse pad over his crotch] Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. [notices popped kernels in the bag] What the? Some of these kernels have crowned. Andy! [Jim mimes basketball sh*t] Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way? A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb. In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour. Whoa! Boy, I will hammer spank your rear. It's a medical thing. I'm good. I.. Oh my god! Ah! You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine. [Pam leaves work bus] What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage. It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas. Yo. Dudeces. No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site. Yes! [Group cheers] Oh! Yes! [Group cheers, Dwight moves to driver seat] Get your foot behind the yellow line. Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately? No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him. Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge? Next stop pies! I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas. That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The t*nk are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up. Hey honey, I don't think we should push him. Stop ordering me around, Jim! Pies! OK, fine. You win. Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in Jim's lap] Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie. Oh my! [to Jim] Go up and check on him. He's upset. What? I'm barren, Jim. My trouser hives are void of honey. I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building. You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank? That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs] Alright then. Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive? What position did you use to conceive? Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright. [Erin cries, Nelly comforts her] It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you. You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it. Bildenkinder. Oh! [Jim reenters bus through hatch] Hey! How'd it go? Yeah? Well, actually, rhubarb is- the one pie that I don't. Oh! [bus tears around corners as group crashes into each other] Oh my god. I'm getting so stuffed. My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ... I am Dr. Cinderella. No, I'm a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen. Uh, Jim, you're not dressed up at all. So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me? Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me. You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael's Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I'm so not prepared. Yeah. I mean, listen if we're gonna do this thing, we should do it right. I kind of am. It's crazy. Jim. Look I'm eating you. So the workspace looks awesome. I've also been running the numbers and between our backers and our own investments, we're looking great for a full year on this. Oh Jim, I explained everything. So you're all set. Wow, well what level of investment were you thinking about? Welcome aboard! Hey, how'd it go? Did you end up investing? How much? About ten? Wow. Wow. No yeah. Yeah. So did everybody ... Did everybody end up investing ten thousand? What? They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars? So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player? [singing ‘I'll Be'] Talk about it now. We said some. We said ‘some.' Doesn't mean you're the best singer ever. d*ck. They lost me when they sang ‘Monster Mash'. That song obviously glorifies the occult. Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to? No I'm just, I'm saying, what would happen if they didn't sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be sh*t? No! No, I'm interested. I mean I think everybody's interested in why they have to sing it. Andy's family had a total meltdown. His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman. The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so.. [wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...[Group protests] ...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason. He's gonna be disappointed. That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom. Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled! [Jim runs panicked into break room] For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich. Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson [points to Jim]. Please sir! Spare him. Please. And you didn't call Jim - that seems significant. No, he shouldn't. Can you go instead? I can't. I have the thing. [on phone] Okay lets get started. Uh,, well you're the only one ‘on' - we're all here. That's the winter season., three months. Are you at your office right now? [laughing] Uh, yeah, that sounded kinda spooky-sexy, over here Halpert. Whoa. [laughing] I think there's been a bit of a mistake. We're trying to reach Jim Halpert, not Batman. Uh, yeah... Okay, yeah. This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun. [on phone] It was in what? Jim, we're having a lot of trouble hearing you. Where are they? Who was messing with my van? [on phone] Jordan wore them for nobody? We're not following you, Halpert. [to Clark] Do you have a valid passport? [on phone] Hey, it's Colin. I know. Don't worry about it. It's just... it's not totally working. Yeah, well, it's not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I don't know how we're gonna do this. Sure you don't want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one. Are you avoiding your phone call? What? Yeah, right. As if. Last week Jim wasn't there, and they named the company Athlead. Tell them your opening line. I think it's good. He likes fishing. [phone vibrates] Oh, look at that. Yeah, he's free anytime. Not a problem. [on phone] Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there's a crisis -- the more I think about it -- They did? Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work. Why should we help you? When is my birthday? I don't know, because we're not friends. Now we're talkin'. 00. Keep in mind, once I leave, there's no turning back. There we go. All right, let's do it. You know what? I don't know where the years went.  ‘Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don't even recognize them. Whose hands are these? [holding out her hands to Jim] Theyre not my hands. I don't know. Nice! Yeah. Don't be pushy Jim. It's tacky. No, there's wine in here. Is it white wine? [to customer] Can you help me? [groaning while trying to open giant wine bottle] ha ha! I don't like him either.  And yet I really like him. [chuckles] [laughing] Yeah, we really did peel your grapes. Shuckin' your peas. Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.  I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt. Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness? Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever. What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel. No! [Holds up a picture] This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style. I'm on it. Movie is starting. [Comes up behind Jim and puts his hands on Jim's shoulders] Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man. So you sure you remembered everything for your trip? What else could you possibly be forgetting? You have never been cooler. You're welcome. It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib. Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook? I feel like [Pam look's out the window and camera pans out in The Office]--Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem. [Cackling] Ohh...[In a German Accent] Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I! Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! [Runs over to Stanley and points at his stomach with a stick] Ohh...Too much strudel. No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel. No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable. No, impish or admirable. I decided earlier. Of course I checked it. I checked it more than once. Impish or admirable. No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder [puts a mouse trap in Pam's bowl] In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.[Kevin giggles as Dwight is poking him with a stick for being impish] Oh, really? Already? It's a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going? But you work tomorrow. But we were gonna break the pig rib. Remember? No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present? Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! [Jim holds his hands like a bowl] I judge your year as impish. [Hits Jim with stick] [Hits Jim three more times] I judge you impish! They're not abandoning the party. [h*t's Jim again] Just--Just--Hey![Dwight hits him again] [Hits Jim some more] Impish! [Chases Jim out] Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too. [Leans up against the wall as Dwight comes back in][Everyone groans. And in his office, Daryl continues to drink the gluhwein] Well...this is it. Shut up. I'm trying to be serious. I can't believe this is actually happening. Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You're gonna be great. Okay. Love you. No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt. Jim! Oh--Oh my god![Pam goes to hug Jim, but Dwight runs and hugs Jim first] What happened? Did you miss your bus? [Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it! [To himself] Back for more, huh? [Gets up and walks towards Jim] You! [Looking at Jim confused] That's great. Thanks, man. I shall come by at your convenience. [Claps his hands once, spins around] Whoo! To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops. No. Bynum, obvious monster and the three point sh**ting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip] Oh, the Nets are super tough. [Jim in pain from his lip] The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible. Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table] Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family. I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos. Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting? Jim, limo's here. Oh, call me later! Good luck! Love you. Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me. Yeah, take some home if you want. No, Mr. Irving called. Said he'd rather meet you at his private court. I hope you don't mind me bringing you out here. I can't get my knees under a desk. Well, do you think you can sink one from deep? Okay. [Jim sh**t the basket and it goes in] Wow, Halpert's got game. It's your wife? You better take it. Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went. He's really making you work for it, huh? Great. I am k*lling it over here. [drops mayonnaise on the ground] Jim, I gotta go. No problem. Hey Jim, what size do you wear, man? I got a pair of japanese Nikes with your name on them. What do you think? You're Kareem, coming to help. And it went like this. [Jim's phone starts ringing] That's it. Yeah, you show me how. [on phone with Jim] I hope you've been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it's time for another episode of "Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire". Oh, god, this again? You're Stinky. Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim? How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour. ...And I want to reach every demographic possible. We're talking weeks here, not months, right? Alright. Good. Good! I just wanted to see you! Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out! Wow, this place is... so great. I had no idea – on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky. If this company's going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it. Sure, no problem. Yeah. "Mandate"- Always think of two men on a date. [awkward moment] I have gay friends... I have one gay friend. [to Jim] Oscar? I'm a laywer. I'm the only one here who can honestly help. [group chuckles] Not us. Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail? I think I'm a little too busy these days to s--- [whispering] Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail. Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight! Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ... You don't remember? [on phone to Jim] There's nothing down here. Pete and I work well together -- not that there's anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I'm into girls. Not that I'm into Pete. Ugh! What was the question? Hey Jim. Peter Rowley at Bridgeport Capital requested a meeting at lunch. Uh sure. No problem. [on phone] Hey, Halpert, what's the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you're stealing Darryl too. When will it end? You won't stop until you've poached us all. No. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let us lose me. Bye, Dwight. Let's call him.[line trilling] Hey, Hon, are you close? What? Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren't gonna make it. I want Daddy. Of course. Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something. Bye, Daddy. Peter, please. We completely understand your concerns here. Let us just show you the latest projections. Jim? Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he's gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--[cell phone vibrates] Hey. So, how's it going? I'm so sorry. [sighs] Oh, I'm sorry. I feel like you've already been working insanely hard. Um, actually, funny story -- I didn't get it. I shouldn't have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all. No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part. Yeah, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it. Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit? I don't know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there. You know what? I-- I-- I don't think you want to start a conversation with me about what's fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever -- Jim. We need you. I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want. Yep. Yep. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam. I chose my words very carefully. When are you talking to David Wallace? Too late. My hopes are up. And this chair's gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha! No doy! [laughs] No earbuds! [both laugh] Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview? Thanks, dude. You—you sure it's okay? ‘Cause you're kinda— Oh, Dove Men. Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this? Thanks, dude. Why? [exhales] Wintergreen. Yeah, good nose. Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault. Here's an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others. [on phone] Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later. Really? That's interesting. ‘Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, k*lling it lately. Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work. Yeah. And I know we have a call scheduled for later – Yeah. What's up Jim? It's okay. Go ahead, Jim. Okay. Jim, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. [whispers] I'd love to invest. [patting Darryl's hair] It's dense. Like bread. Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. And I was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife. Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it's your call. I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray. Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal. Yes. Thank you. Amazed. What? This is such bullcrap! Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them? Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever. Yeah. No limit on w*apon class, right? All right. I think that went well. Oh, cool. Hey Clark. Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate. Of course. Okay. Bye. Aah! [on phone with Robert] We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too. Hey. Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates. Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom. Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room. I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. [boom microphone bumps her head, she smiles] I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian. Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to h*t first. Yes sir. [notices Jim's using his coffee mug] [points to Jim and Darryl] This is the team. You too... Darryl. It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes. That's my go-to thermos. That's all. No big deal. No big deal. Nah, nah... [as Jim empties thermos into trash] Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that. I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak? Oh, hey. I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool? All right. I didn't say anything. Excuse me? What you need flour for, Jim? What? You making bread? What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel? All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all. We good. Nothing. [pulls out a can of soda] It's mine. [Jim shakes his head] [after looking through DVR] What happened to my Tavis Smileys? Seeya. [playing video game with Jim] Oh. Come on! Damn! [to Jim] Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day. [makes magic trick hand gesture] Alakazam! [eating] These are gross. Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill. It's with Brian and Alyssa. I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life. That sounds nice. Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere. [Oscar and Darryl exit holding hands] Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK. He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly. Yeah. We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb. [obviously flustered] Yeah. At least my crying won't get you fired. OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why? I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress. It's not Brian's fault. Yes. [hugs Erin] Come on. Totally. Oh? Are you sure? [obviously hurt] Yeah. OK. [they begin to leave] [sees it's a drawing of hers, framed] Wow. I didn't know you kept this. Thank you. I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight. Yeah, I do. [whispers] hello! Hi! Hey, do I look ok? [pointing to Jim's bluetooth headset] What's that? Is that a- Thanks. Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me. Hey, Jim! We've got Trent Edwards on the line. [on phone] hey! Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so- Eight? Really? Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can k*ll four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight. Hello? Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne? Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job. Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate. [laughs] You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny. So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura. Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least. Guess what poster he had on his wall? MmMm. MmMm. You're getting colder. [laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green. I don't know, but it's interesting right? He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day. Mmhm. I don't know. I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this. Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton. My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt. Keep them. I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a b*tch. I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face] I miss her so much. That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage. [on phone] Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week. I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'. [laughs] Um. You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen? Oh, oh OK. [sighs] Um, Ok. Well? Yeah, sounds good. Ok. Ok. 19 is aight" Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy. I mean that's the guy's name, right? ChobbleGobbler? Hey there, Ryan. Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh. [to camera] Eat Fresh. [eating soft pretzel] We've all changed. "C'mon, I can do that." Subway sandwiches. How? I didn't say Subway sandwiches. It's called playing the subtext. I actually wrote a screenplay, it's called "The Big Piece" Half biopic and half superhero movie. A mild mannered professional baseball player, Ryan Howard- The space dust does it. I actually brought a- some copies of my script if you guys wanna read it together. Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it. Look, if you give me a chance I can, I- [Pam leaves] Pam. That'll pay for the exploding helicopter. "Suddenly, the evil thugs break in to the stadium. The Big Piece hits baseballs at the evil thugs." Yeah, Jim. "Oh yeah!" "They kiss. It is super emotional. Like in Toy Story." Keep reading then. Um another thing. I'm gonna need you to get me the rights to Darth Vader. We can look into it. We need Darth. We'll go after Darth then. That's what we gotta do. I mean, we've having issues. It can't hurt to talk about them, right? Oh, sure. Let's do it. Let's get personal. Whoa. Oh, yeah, no, it's okay. I can handle it. Um, so... [chuckles, snorts] Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren't in couple's counseling, are you? Oh, God. Yes, it is your mistake. He's lingering. So annoying. I'm gonna k*ll him. How can I help? I'm here. [slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay? You're really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator. He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he shouldn't be rewarded for that. I feel like he's always making these decisions for the family, and then I'm left playing catch-up. Well, what's a little while? I mean, what's the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn't know when it's gonna end. I'm sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don't want him to do it anymore, and I don't want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly. W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere. I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times. So, we had couple's therapy. And we have homework. And we're also supposed to speak our truths. Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy. I'm not giving up. I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher. Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea. Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting. I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar. Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers] Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. [Jim hangs up phone] I appreciate the sacrifice. Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth? I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok. Jim! [hands him umbrella] Alright, have a good trip. Bye. [walks away] I love you.  It's great. The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts. Nice morning, too. Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent's putting me up for a furniture commercial. Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what's up? Back in the small pond? Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on. Tell me about it, you know? I've been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don't know if I'm wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup. Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly w*apon in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and— I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided. Ah! [throws punch] That's how it's done. I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole. Right. Yeah. But, you know, I've actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I've earned this. I mean, you know? it's okay. You can sit in the annex. I'll come visit you. Andy sings beautifully. And he's really good at dancing. He's a good speaker. But there's just something there you don't want to look at. Yeah, a little bit. Oh, no, no, no. No it's cool. It's cool, man. I'm sure you and I will have our own thing. Oh! I'm am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue. So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on. Again! And I'm looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy? You sure? Yeah. No, I don't think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can't make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it? Yes. Yeah. Oh, boy. Um— I could give you some beginner stickies? Here you go. Mm-hmm. It's all yours. You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that. Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager's job? Yeah, right. I'm afraid that ship has sailed. Hey. Hi. Um, I have a question. Oh, I had a question. I did! Super important. Okay. All right. I did not come back here just to see you. I don't know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out. I had no idea. And here I've been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin' sheep. Oh, well, Thursday's tough, because of— They are. Pam. So... I wanted to offer you a new position. Assistant regional manager. Jim. Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot. Uh, dream. Goin' with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn't that right, Jim? Can't you just leave? You talk to Wade and Colin? We got an offer on the table. A buyout. We're in play, baby. they're gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby. Yeah, we did it. Wade said we could do the whole country in three months. Can't do what? No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything. Well, b*rned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America's Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It's a really cool show, it's like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean! Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best. Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we've overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World w*r— Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office. Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting. Is that them again? Maybe you should call back? I will. I will. Welcome. Please take an agenda item. Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. "Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try." [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you. Question. We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they're delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, "Nice jugs"? Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today. Not now! Private time! Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box] Which is, of course... Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me. The power source. A loyal, but bungling apostle. Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore. I'd have to get some more wire and string, but it's doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable? I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind? What are you so excited about? What are you up to? Fine. You'll always have the upper hand, when you've got a good a-arm. Trademark pending. Wow, the honor. God, I envy them. You don't need to repeat right now, when I'm saying it. Alright. I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all. Uh, two. Not even close, Meredith. Come on! Theme song from Saved by the Bell. Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other's minds. You're trying to give your wife this job. A horse. What's the opposite of a horse? Sea horse. Say that? Uncanny. Yeah. I would love a corn dog. No, no, no, no! You don't read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There's no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don't have diplomatic relations. If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then. I'll try this one. [grabbing the coffee] Hot! [over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously? [running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here's your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah! Guess I'm going upstairs. I know. Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant- Me. Yes! [weak applause] Thank you. Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right? Hey. Are you happy? No, I know that you're, like, happy and, like, you had fun today. And that was fun. But what about a year from now? What about five years from now? Because I'm so glad you're back, baby, but I'm just—I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you're giving up so much. Okay. I kind of forced you to do it. Yes, I did. I'm afraid that you're gonna resent me and I'm afraid that— This is not enough for you and I'm afraid that I'm not enough for you. Is that really what you think? Bye.[Dwight throws "Now" beanie at Jim's head] I need you to perform a test. On an innocent baby. Damn straight. Hey, he can handle it. Oh I can so just sit here and cry! What is this? Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red. [throws "now" beanbag at Jim] Now. Go ahead. Ok, um, this is... [leaves DVD with her]—I'll be right back. I was thinking of proposing to Esther today. She's got a ton of great qualities. She's young, she's beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we're third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn't technically incest. Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm. And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up. Angela.[Pam hesitates but puts the DVD into the laptop to watch] Some sort of virus? Oh.[Pam starts the video; title screen reads "Beesly—You think I'll have regrets. I asked the doc crew to help me show you why I won't..."; highlights of Pam and Jim from the documentary play over Snow Patrol's "Open Your Eyes"] You're a good assistant, Jim. That's very true. Get the hell outta here. You got it.[video shows teapot clip from "Christmas Party"; Pam notices the card that Jim took back] Yeah. What's that? One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same. Ooh. [crying] At least I got chocolate. I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it's good for the environment too. [to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom? After 16 years, it's strange sitting across from somebody who isn't Stanley. But...he'll get there. Party time! Whorehouse! Well, you're the bestisch mensch. Great, now we got three hours to fill. Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing. [whispering to Phyllis] That's Baby Wawa, right? Oh, my God! Hello, hello. Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet. Uh, better ask Jim. I love it. And it's Athleap now. And the city is amazing. Yeah. Yeah, it's hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are...for real. Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn't on the itinerary. Jim...wha... Come on! What...what are you gonna whack me, Jim? A bazooka. You remembered. Woo! Okay! Yeah! [to camera] Guten Prank number two. Amazing. Hey, I know you. Are you gonna sit here and cry? [fake cries] Oh, man, never thought I'd say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings] Good old Mose. [laughing] A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose. Right. Which one is that? Mm, hey driver. Why don't you take us to 3030 Adams? [to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim] You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch. Waste of a good hatchet. I heard you say "well" the first time. Guten Prank. What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?! No. We can't see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk. Yes, I'm living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds. No, no, I'm fine. Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don't know. I'm working on something. Awww. I have a question for Jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how you're soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia? Oh, I'm gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank. [chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars] Oh, no. What? Oh, come on. I've never heard of such a thing. Not... significant is a big word... I think you're only a teeny... Jim. That's what she said. Everybody! I need to get out of this dress. Oh, I'm sorry Pam. [whispering] I'm so sorry. They were an hour late. Okay, Okay. Um... so... this past year has been really great, and you've been great and I just... I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn't be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture... and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future. Yeah. Well, you... you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you. Austin? Maybe. I'm doing it for us. Okay. We'll take it. We wanna buy your house. I wanna do this. I really want to do this! [hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God! [taking pictures] Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. All right, that's great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody. Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look? I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing... No, don't say it. You're fired! You're both fired! Thanks Dwight. Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay...in my barn. [playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn't matter. ‘Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same... Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome. I'm happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down. Ooh. [crying] At least I got chocolate. I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it's good for the environment too. [to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom? After 16 years, it's strange sitting across from somebody who isn't Stanley. But...he'll get there. Party time! Whorehouse! Well, you're the bestisch mensch. Great, now we got three hours to fill.

Yeah. Well, you... you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you. Austin? Maybe. I'm doing it for us. Okay. We'll take it. We wanna buy your house. I wanna do this. I really want to do this! [hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God! [taking pictures] Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. All right, that's great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody. Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look? I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing... No, don't say it. You're fired! You're both fired! Thanks Dwight. Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay...in my barn. [playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn't matter. ‘Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same... Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome. I'm happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down. A celebrity sex tape. Not relevant. Not relevant. It all happened so fast. And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in. Cool. Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was h*t by a car. Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that h*t her. Oh, Michael. No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I h*t one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree. I can take 3 people. No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault. [groaning] I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke. Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine. [walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it. [sighs] Well I'm gonna start fast. Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle. Then I'm gonna end fast. Cause they're just stupid. [looks at camera] What? Yeah... That was um... Yeah, I gave him a ride home because... ... We're dating. Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right? Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So... Giant check it is. Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control. Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check. I don't think so. That's possible. Look into that. So I closed the door but the image of his... ... dangling participle... ... still b*rned in my eyes. See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear. I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended. That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun. They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat. Yeah. [laughs] Oh we're in last place. I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today. I don't know I'm really committed to winning. Mmm... Yes. Yeah. [holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00. [bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't b*at rabies. Nobody can b*at rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could b*at it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line] Yeah probably. Hey, Michael? I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just... What do you want me to do Jim? No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins. I'm still having a nice day. Hey. I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim] Yeah. No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right? You guys are together? Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. [gestures to Pam to get up] Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, [to Jim] stand up. [Jim moves over in chair] OK, here we go. [holding both Pam and Jim's hand] Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one. I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim] Hey... [sees both Jim and Pam] you two. Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really. Uh huh. Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know? Let's just wait. OK. Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains. You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you h*t with the car, we're goners. No.. [in awe] No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque. You didn't say anything to me? Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here. OK. OK. No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like "where's the Beef?" [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah. Hi. Nice to meet you. Why not? Hey. It's funny you bring that up because yes it is. I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but... I now find you repulsive. Eh... OK. Or him. What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever. Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now? What does that mean? Great. I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me. You should come visit. The city is... amazing. No. You don't know until you live there. There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city. No. You can't imagine it, though. The energy when you're actually there. You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you. Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless. No. It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds. And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They are unreadable. They're just numbers and boring and blech. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar. Use your imagination. Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle? Hey... there he is. I never thanked you for coming to the hospital. Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut. Anyway, I have this Sharpie... And I was wondering if you could sign my cast? [lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it? [whispers] I'll read this when I get home. Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you. That's ridiculous. I'm not going to be beaten by a website. And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done. Ehh, can't do that. Really hard for me to let things go. Yes like a chime or a bell... Got it. Carb up. Uhyeaahhh! Hello, Susan? Dwight Schrute. Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices. He's going through a break-up. [on monitor] You tell me. So. This is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now. Like twins. Alright. Well fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good. Just let me know who the winner is.Pam and Not it. I won. No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what? Ah no! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit! Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman? Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone] Fine. Good. Yeah. Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one. Goodie. What's up man? Make a delivery. Alright. I'm ready to go and I'm callin' g*n. Yes. Thank you. You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham] Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured... Same sort of stuff in here. Mmwa. Mmwa. Leaving Pennsylvania. One for me one for Jan. You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday? Wanna come over Friday? After work you guys... Yes. Actually I will tell you right now. It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password. So... What are you doing? No. No, I'm sure that's not. Na... Yes. Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us? Stop talking all at once! Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson? You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions. I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want. I think you're over-thinking it. Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our... Trouble. Okay, alright. He said no. No, no. What's going on? I'll just wave and introduce myself. I'm all over it. Okay. Good pizza. Different stuff. Which one's this? Perfect. Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight. You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired. Yep. Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time. [looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it. [picks up phone] Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein! None of your business, Jim. Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest. Dammit. What? Oh no, I have a thing tonight. How about this weekend? Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right. You wouldn't understand. It's a secret. I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will--[notices camera]-- it will be that easy. The Beets Motel. Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon! Irrigation. I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions? No. You could make jokes when you've made a sale there rookie, ok? [laughter ends] What? Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being m*rder here tonight. I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy. [Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare? Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose. Does Mose have nightmares? Is everything satisfactory with your stay? Great. Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff. Pam. 30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'. No, whomever is never actually right. She poses. Stupid. No. We wrote a good review. Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times. Table making never seemed so possible. Uhh-mmm [moaning] [incoherent mumbling] No you didn't. Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling] Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her] Okay. Yeah. Jim's just really passionate about Italian food. Best ad ever. [sings in the tune of the "Kit Kat theme song"] Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing? What? No, why? [singing] Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce. Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car. Who else? I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide. Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers. Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with. News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later. No talk, I'm animating. Are you serious? Oh my God, he's really in pain. Who's that? He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that? Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too. You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar. No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim. Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape] Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet. No no, you can go home. I'm good. You comin'? Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Thank you. No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real. Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player? [claps and cheer] Really? Hey listen, you ever been on a motorcycle? No, no, no, no, no-no, no no. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her. Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me. Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny. Jim, we're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it. What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. Corcroan dropped Staples. That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving. I- I have no words. Look at his face! Look at his face! We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing. Uh-huh. Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim. Yow! Are you calling Karen? Yep, get it. [throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha! It had to be done, it had to be done. Oh no, that is too bad. sh**t. Hey Dwight, he found it. Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever. Do you really wanna know? Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know. It could be badass. Yeah, it will. Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass. Teach her to offer Stanley more money. So, why did you and Karen break up? Was it the sex? I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is... ...awesome. Okay, I will start. Um, "A." [singing] "A" my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell... Damn it! What do we sell? Um... I'm trying to think of what we could sell. Ah, la, la, la. What is that? That sound... The air-conditioning leaking or something? I'm peeing in this empty can. Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go. I'll k*ll you man! That is just so disgusting! Why can't I be in the club? Afro wig, do you want the afro wig? Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down. You and I- And if we have to defend ourselves, I will s*ab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk. Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes. Okay, Jim. Let's move! Move, move, move, move! I'm breathing heavily. I can see the security guard's eyes. The eyes are the groin of the head. We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier. It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running. Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim! Dwight, you gotta move! I'm losing control of my bladder. Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim. Just say you wanna get back together. Jim? Uh, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier. Jim, hang on a second? So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh? If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult. [huffs] Oh, things are going really well? Are they? They are? That's great, that's so great. I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam. Can you tell me more about that? Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you. Traffic, yeah. Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, b*at-b*at the traffic, mm-hmm. I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise. How on Earth did Michael call my bluff? Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things. I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything. How humiliating. Would it help you to return to another age? A time of refinement, and civility. Oh-oh, come on! Okay, did you get it out of your system. Fun? Really? What was fun about it for you? Was it the death of the twins? Did you even read it? Who was the main character? Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? [Jim makes a face] Not real. So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go? Absolutely, yes. Really? Oh, you wanna go today? And I am always busy. How often can you actually donate blood? Your body only has a certain amount. Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame. A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands] Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself--- In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change. I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos. Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours. Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me. This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I. When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being. Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday. Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember? It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers... What? [flashback to Stanley's birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do cr*ck! Not cr*ck the drug. Oh! [Michael laughs] So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive. Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh? Do you think it's a good idea? Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it. Ok. [picks up and reads memo] "Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today." This is really cool. No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun. Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake? I really prefer devils food cake. Yes! Wow! That was easy. I hate devils food. Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday. Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake. I want pie. I want peach pie. I want a nice cobbler. I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen. Tuna. [rolls in chair to Jim's desk] Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale. Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale. Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up. Loud and clear. [rolls in chair back to desk] Pizza rolls. Hey, Jim. [knocks] Hey Jim. Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea. Yeah... My birthday was two months ago. There was no party. 58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot. I don't know, I just thought you could include me. I just though you could add me. I don't see the harm in that. Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon. I'm allergic to mushrooms. [raises hand] Conference room? [raises hand] Hey, Michael. I mean Jim. Hey, buddy. What up? You are relieved. So what did I miss? Oh. Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake. Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out. That's what I said. That's what she said. I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard. [playing ping-pong] Game, son! Jim. Can I see you for a second? Sure. Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and b*at Darryl. Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is b*ating you. [flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong? Sorta, yes. [reading off paper] "Mr. Scott, do you realize you just contradicted yourself?" "I did?" "Yes you did." "Can I go to the bathroom?" "No." "I really have to, I've been drinking lots of water." "You went five minutes ago." "That wasn't to go to the bathroom, that was to get out of a question." "You still have to answer it." "First can I go to the bathroom?" "No." All right! What is going on here? Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice? Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable. Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now? Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass. O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net] Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. [to Jim] Do you have plans tonight? All right, happy Friday. [to Jim] Well I think we dodged a b*llet there. I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks? You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said. Hello. Yes I would. So, what have you been doing? Yeah. Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing. So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first? Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs. I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell. When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away. Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy. I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out. [reveals a tiny TV] I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space? [moves TV back a couple inches] Voila, right in the wall. Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table. It's pine. I bet you are. Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth. Look at him, he's laughing. Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone] Well you don't need two of you to do that. Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself. I don't know. No, Baah! But he's married to her! No rhyming! Those aren't helpful. [in the garage] So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand [the chairs are shaped like hands]. So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles. Thought about it, I'm in. Excuse me for a second. [gets up from the table] Purely carnal and that's all you need to know. E-mail? Ok... alright... here we go. [takes down huge painting behind his seat and puts up a neon beer sign] There. [plugs it in] Oooookay. Fine. Get outta here. You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon. Jim? Pam? [whispers] Flooded. [Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe. Hmm? W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get. Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim. [to Jim] Who are you putting down? Who is it? Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah. Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...[walks away back to his office] I know. Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move. Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too. No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged. Hmm, I don't, know... Oh, right now? OK, so then, when? Oh, right, yeah. Ohh kay. I've been warned. Nice job. Yeah. I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one... [smiling] I hate you. [walks away] Oh, oh. OK, let me be. I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil. I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich. My favorite branch. How's everybody doing? Love it. Go. I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that. David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right? You did. Yeah. I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all. It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store. Would you have sex with Meredith? Do you think she'd keep it quiet? Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that... Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan. Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome. Who you dating? That's... I, I think that... You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow. Let's do it! Later. Did you not tell the security guard we were working late? Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool. When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it. No. Yes, it's Eddie. Hank, his name is Hank. Elliot! [to troy] Do you have powers? Jim was supposed to collect it. Hmm... Hello? Yeah. I'll get ready to leave. [on phone] Stop calling me so I can put on my damn socks! I know, here we go. Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish? Theyhappenedto speak Spanish. M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't... I love it! Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael] [with petroleum jelly on his face] Hurry, please. Can you breathe? Hold your breath. Ready? Ener-gize... Don't, don't-- If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no. Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim? Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme... [to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan? How do you live with a franchise this bad? Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance. It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation. This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it. Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want? Because you're very important? It's like a mock execution. Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out. Everybody, except Stanley. I can't find my glasses. Let's go! [takes golf swing] Whoa! Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole? And that. Is why. I need a smart intern. I can't complain, people love their junk mail. You know what Jim? I'm not really looking to change things up right now, I just came out here to get out of the office for a little bit, so why don't we just play, okay? Absolutely, will do. Oh! [Phil is stuck in the sand trap] Ah, dammit! Yeah I'll- I'll get it out. Thank you. [Jim's cellphone rings] AH! Come on, Tuna! Just checking in, how's it going? I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess. Talk to you later? All right! I'll tell you what. My fiscal year ends in two months, let's talk then. Sound good? Right on. [clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it? Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like] Well done. [cell phone rings] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. [phone keeps ringing] Hello? Hello? Hello? Jim, what are you doing? Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha- [into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute! [cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail. Hey, is this Dwight? Oh my goodness, you sound sexy. Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece. Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done. [office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight. Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine. Hey. [kisses Jim on cheek] Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design. Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome! I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw "congratulations" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack. So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months... Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great. I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office] Congratulations! Don't interrupt. Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website? All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website. Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up] [listening to "Crash Into Me" on his computer] Hmm... Jim? [Jim comes into his office] I am downloading some N3P... Music... For a CD mix tape... For Holly. And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels. The two levels being, uh, "Welcome to Scranton"... And "I... love you." Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2? I think I do. Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears. Well, you're not a romantic. Oh really? Like, with who? Pam? Yeah, you took it too slow. This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me. I don't want her to get away. I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work. Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't... Why would you do that? Really? Well we all want a good party, right? I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me. I did it! [exhales] I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point. It was hard. I wanted to kiss her. Whew, oh God. [inhales] Laying a base. Laying a base... I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, "Hi Ryan." And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, "Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison." Absolutely. [dials and hands Jim receiver] Wow. Look at our parking lot. I have done things like um, "Beers in Heaven." Or, "Total Eclipse of the Fart." I like that one. [to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again. Tuna! [hugs Jim; makes small expl*si*n sound] I'm engaged! Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow. Jimbo. Did you see Holly's butt? Why? I know. I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read "Lonesome Dove" three times. And that her butt refuses to quit! [follows Jim into bathroom] You have to agree with me. [follows Jim back out] That's insane. OK. Yes. Yes. Fax this for me. [sees Pam and Jim through office window, runs out the office] Hey, hey! [falls down stairs, gets up, falls down again] Pam, Pam! Hey! I took a lot from other poems. OK, bye. No, Michael. All right! Dunder Mifflin, this is Ronnie. Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't. [to Jan] Come on. Let's go in. 30. That's how I sleep at night! [on computer screen] I can see you! This is so cool. Lunch with a girl from my hall. g*n weddings. Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose? If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this? This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing. Booty call. Here. Wait a second. [removes condom from wallet, throws it to Jim] I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me. You want more? I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.] Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera] Does anyone want to dance? Jim. I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year. I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history. I've even started volunteering. Giving back to the community. I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean. All right. Close the door. This is your fault. Your stupid friend zone. Attention! Attention! We only have a few weeks left. [looking at Phyllis] And most of you are just as fat as the day we began. I am hardly the problem, Jim. Gah, the dreadmill. [both laugh] What are you doing? Body image. We are here because there is something wrong with society. I want you to know. Kelly, look at me! I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are truly, truly beautiful. Give me a hug. [Michael hugs Kelly, his head in her chest] Mmmmmm. Excellent! Good job. You've already disappointed him so much. He can't be expecting a lot from you. Yes, you do. I do not! I do not say "Hi" Pam! I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right? No football games, recitals, karate tournaments. OK. I'm gonna write you both up for not working. ) P.S. I finally finished my summer project. We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly. Please? Ok, that is fine. Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok? Hey! This is not half-way! I did the math. I had to drive way longer than you. Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch. What are you doing? Oh my God! Oh my God! Yeah. Wet Tuna! OK. [on the phone] Well, I should go. No, don't. I'm mad at them. Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement. What? Why not? Come on, it won't be that bad. I thought you were already engaged. That was Roy. She was engaged to Roy. I got a gift for Pam and Roy. Do I have to get another one? A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here? [to Jim] To be married? Oh come on! He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired. [to Jim] Oh check it out, "Hired Guy." Time thief. Time thief! f*re him! Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates. Well... I'm not quitting. What are you doing? Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn? That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody! He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch] There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch] Yeah. Yo. No, I did not. Was that any good? Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it] Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica? Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool. No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal. You know what I am talking about. You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the... I will be honest with you. That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault. The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her. And I am holding on to her leftovers. [throws Holly's leftovers in the trash] None of your business. [Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine. OK, good. [on phone] So you know Stacy, right? There's no one from England, Jim. Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages. So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab. Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in. No, Sarah Kaya comes in. Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres. So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, "No way. You can't reserve seats." And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box. Yes! No, it's horrible! Jim, she might get arrested. No, Stacy is a boy. Ugh. Frustrating. Why can't you just be in art class with me? Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up] I do not like pregnant women in my workspace. They're always complaining. I have varicose veins, too. I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too? Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital? Hi, Jim! This is my baby. Hey you! Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month. I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going- I can't hear anything! I didn't feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly. [on voicemail, because she's calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam. Leave a message. I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but... I'll leave a message. I guess this is just one of those days. It'll get better. I finished my laundry. Got all my socks. Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you. And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer? You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now. But, don't worry, I'm being safe. And I'm headed home. I'm... headed to my dorm. Not home. Anyway, um... I miss you. Oh, my God, what happened? [Jim holds up phone] You are such a dork! sh*ts! I'm not drunk. Scranton. I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here- Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest. She thought I was McNabb. [laughing] Yeah, well, watcha gonna do? What's up, Roy? I'm not gonna h*t you or anything. You good? I'm good. What's going on with Pam? Yeah? Really? Huh. [laughs] Congrats, man. So Pam's happy? Wow. I thought you were a friend. 1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar. [applause] Nicely done. [dressed as a kitten] Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Cool. [buzzer noise] We were looking for "kitten." Hey. All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge. You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want. All right. We'll see. [to camera] No. Hey guys. Hi! [smooches] Pam, I haven't seen you in so, so long! Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right? Maybe Pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin. So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great. Cute. Yup. She only knows how to play "When the Saints go Marching In." Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right? Miles Davis. Chet ...something. Dizzy Gillespie. You don't! I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art. I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So... For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better. Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle. Thank you. No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam. Nope. Nope. Not yet. Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. "Schindler's List" parody. ... That's not appropriate, no. [on Bluetooth speaker] Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work. It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something. Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet? [listening in New York] I miss him. Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! That's my mug. Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one. [smiles] It is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back. It has my face on it. [Dwight slams something on desk] What was that? Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon? What are you mumbling about? None of your business. Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information -- I'm being sabotaged. And I'm going to find that person and punish them. You're an idiot. Jimbo, let's do this thang. [whispers on bluetooth] Good luck. I love you. What do you think I am saying to you?! Oh, come on. You too? [touches ear] Jim? Jim? No. [glances at it] Yes, I am sure, Jim. It -- I agree. So let's see what we can find out from reading. [reads] Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant. [points at Jim] Arrogance. And there's our smudgeness. Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist. Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called? All right, fine. [picks up phone] Brrring. Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything. What is your name, sir? Really, that's your real name? Yes, Michael. What? No, but I -- It's up to you to change his mind. Oh, no. What's wrong? Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited-- OK, as I was saying, right now we are having -- OK, our prices have never been lower. ...never been lower! That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client. Here we go. Please, Mr. Buttlicker -- I have to put you on with my boss. Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager. Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you? You are the master. Yes. On it! Get in! Get in! [he peels off into parking space] Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing "Centerfold."] They might be listening to us. Customer service might be monitoring this conversation. You never know. Better safe than sorry. Who stands to benefit from our downfall? Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that. [on Bluetooth] Ooh, cute shoes online. I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need? Who are you talking to? She's not here, Jim. Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself. [surprised] Ah! OK. [in New York] That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said! Good one. Yeah, he's weird. OK. Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye. [on Bluetooth] That was weird. Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath? Did you do something to her? Well, something's off. All right. Living in the moment. I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned? What? Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one. Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there. Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead. Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks] [walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis] No. [holds Sheriff's Department mug protectively] No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut] Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators? Obviously. I knew it. Yeah. What? I was -- I was right. I was right. I knew it. I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim] I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her. Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake. Hey, what are you doing here? It's Pam. Uh, I came to kidnap you. There's free wine and cheese at the Chuck Close retrospective. Let's go. OK. Wow. Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim's ear] May I? Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time? In Japan you must always commit su1c1de to avoid embarrassment. In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. This is considered to be polite. I am jetting off on an international business trip. To Can-A-da. Canada. T minus... [walks up behind Jim and puts his hands on his shoulders] One more week. [at school in NYC] Can't believe this. [pulls out cell phone... sighs] [over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing. I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark. I hate computers. I have to stay and retake it. That means another twelve weeks. [pause] Can you do this for another three months? [over phone] I know. [starting to cry] Right. [over phone] Yeah I'm fine. Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go. Alright. [over phone] Love you. Bye. Okay. Oh, well, doesn't surprise me. Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy. You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats. I'm coming back the wrong way. [smiles at Jim across the parking lot] It's not because of you. I don't like graphic design. That's it. [laughs] Stop smiling. I really didn't like it. It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton. But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it? Alright. First thing in the morning then. Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie. Heh, okay, weirdo. She said she was going to give it to him right now. [starts laughing] Yeah, they used to. Oh, can you imagine? Uhhgh. I don't know. What? So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place? Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk. I saw some email. I got peepers of an eagle. So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in? Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right. Today's a big day. Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom. It's got shag carpets. I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's. And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting] She's gonna love it. Right? Jim, don't listen to Andy. I think it's so romantic. Where's your place? Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry. We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there. When it comes down to it, it's a health issue. I should have written that. [looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me? Are you inching away from me? Reach your arms out. Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah. Hello, Pam. Jim may I have a moment with Pam please. Okay? Sure. [getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house? I don't get it. I bought it. It's ours. Let's go inside, I'll show you inside. [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor. Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet. Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall] Yeah, I am really sorry about this. I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there. Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood. [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door] I love it. Yeah, I love it! I mean, you bought me a house! You bought me a house! Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom? And the clown? I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this. What? Jim. Why me? Hey. So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing... I really think you should reconsider. Yeah, I know. But I really think you should reconsider. Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right. Okay. Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing. Yes. Ohh, God! Yeah! Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! All right! Cool! [laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael. The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing] Aww. That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage] What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- [steps in manure] Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?! No, copier's great. Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies] And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half] So suck it. Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you. I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king. All right, attention everyone. What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus. [wearing a fur coat] What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, [camera zooms out to see fake blood is splattered on the fur coat] you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory. Yeah, I guess, since I won. What is this? You're so pathetic. How long did this take you? Three hours? Yeah, no such thing. They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs] Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes. Oh, I don't think it's blackmail. Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight. I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter. "My horn can pierce the sky". Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks. And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit. Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod] I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift. And such a genetically improbable one. Look at that. How does that happen? King has sex with a unicorn? Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse? Alright... One more time around the block. I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way. Jim, Jim.... That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice. I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka. Yeah. [sighs] Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India. What about February 2nd? No, no. I celebrate privately. We'll do it quickly. f*re girl. [looks around] Too soon? I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area. I agree. You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better. That's my only wish. But you know what? My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice. Mmmm... chewy. What's up? Sure. I knew it. I knew some of it. It's Christmas. Thank you. I knew it. Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over. Wait, you still don't know... Hmm? You still don't know. [to Jim] What are you doing? Andy. [from inside his office] No, what I'm saying is... No, that's not it. I know. [sighs] How can he still not know? [whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me. I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything. Not yet. You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying. [boastfully] Yes. How so, specifically? Eager. And flexible. Really? It's too late. [sighs] Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it. Yeah, my neighbor got m*rder. If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin. If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to. Where's Dwight? I don't think so. I will fight you. What is your w*apon? Hey, this is none of your business. Mm. So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God. There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table. Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain] No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit. What's this? Hmm. It wasn't here before. Yours doesn't. No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires. What are you doing? She looks like a monster. Yeah, thank you Phyllis. I'm not voting. [counting votes] Five. Five to five. Me too. [smirking] He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing. Oh my God. Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker. [punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently] Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once] Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making. [blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin! This has been a test of our emergency preparedness. There is no f*re. It was only a simulation. No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president! You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth. He's going to swallow is tongue. Open your mouth. Come on. Don't swallow it. okay, that's uh, hard to keep track. How many is that per hour? I will divide and then count to it. We don't normally download films illegally. Because we're honest, hardworking people. But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him. Alright... Lily. [after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on? Yeah. [clears throat] "I state my regret." I want you to stay. I know but if I get it in deeper... Hey. Um, did my dad say anything about my mom? [sighs] I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it. You're good to talk to. [everyone is lying on the floor in the conference room with the light off, Michael is walking around with a candle in his hand] It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance. What did you say to my dad? After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment. Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away] [Toby tries to come on stage] NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY. [Toby shrugs and sits back down] I know where this is goin'. No... No. Spite her - ok [laughter] Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring? Give it up, he's dead. Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then. Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best. Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck? [breathing heavy over intercom, starts laughing] [over PA] This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration. [snickering] I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me. [wheezing laughing, starts coughing] Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it. [still talking over PA] Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets [Jim stands up, puts scissors in back pocket] because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine. You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert. What? You find it? All right. No. Oh, all right. Oh yeah? Screw you too. You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday. Go ahead, you do it. I insist. What he said was... [puts finger toward Jim's face] ...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads. [at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim's arm away] That's on my side. I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win. Hey, HEY. Oh God. Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months? Well, I'm not done yet. It's a statement of fact. This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer. Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's. Have you collected the money from everyone? How much do you have? [yelling] That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim! [struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Who is this? Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you. Uh, 24. 37. [chuckles] Okay. I'd like to contribute. [opens wallet and hands Jim a single bill] There you go. What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm? In juvie. Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers! For reha- What did you do? Huh? I thought you said yesterday was your birthday! You did? I wanna see the cake. I hate it. Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly! Right. I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?! Nice job on the cake, Bozo! Oh, the other one's watching. Busy! Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to sh**t herself in the face. You know what? I'm a little busy. It's not effeminate. It's festive. [blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too. It's in the name. You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid. Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite] Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you? That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed. Hey, it's not a surprise. This doesn't look good. Told you. You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake? Our theme, if you will. Cool. No. You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap. Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this. Mm, great cake. [while leafing through Michael's appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really... Oh, hi! Great. [coming out from his office] Hello, may I help you? ...Jim. Ayyyy! This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances. Really, Jim? On Cupid's birthday? Can I have a word with you, Jim? Yes, um, Jim. Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office. Yeah. And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment. Mm-hmm. Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest-- [gesturing Pam to be quiet] --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party. What do you think? He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy. Everyone here who's bowled a 280 please raise your hand. [Bob does so] Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand. Come on, Bob. Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly] Jim uses a 6 pound ball. Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back. Oh yeah. You can always model ladies' jewelry. What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom? Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They've been in there for like ten minutes. Yes. And I think they gave him too many fries. Aww. [Michael grins sheepishly] [looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What? Well, you should cover it with the broccoli. Do you think they dined and dashed? I thought we were having a nice time. Yeah. [exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it. Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate] My God. OK then. You didn't eat much there Jimbo. Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it. [to Jim] Who's there? Answer the door. No way, it's the KGB. I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight] I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm. Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.' Well that's not what we agreed on. Huh? You're asking him to give up all of his power. That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that? That's low, Tuna. Woo hoo. Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips... ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession? Invite them on the tour. It's gonna hurt. [on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't. I thought I did. So... Well no harm no foul. Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so - Thank you, Jim is with me. Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings] You guys are throwing a lot at me. I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her. [puts hand on Jim's hand] Like that? Yes. He said he would do the same for me. I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination. Give me the details of how that happened. What? You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting. Ding dong. KGB. [in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there? We have more houses to visit. 45? 15? 15. Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence. Jim! Enough with the classy, ok? I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here. Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here? [watches Jim grimace, copies him] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership. Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries. Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then. Strawberries? Not classy at all. Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us . [whispers] Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish. Yes. What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous. Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . . Why are you wearing a tuxedo? Uh. Your name is Jim? He just had to wear his tux today. Nobody thanked me. Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead. Whatcha got, Jim?... What is a two-way petting zoo? [Jim knocks on door] Come in. Hey. Number two? Oh, I didn't know that position existed. So you're the assistant to the regional manager? Any responsibilities come with it? So you keep this made up position? It's important to you? Yeah, would you, uh? It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner. See ya. See ya. [Charles leaves] Bye! I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life. Gives me hope. Maybe I will have one of own someday. [laughs] But I dream... so... Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job. You are head-hunted. Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial Kn*fe, Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual] PSST! PSST! Okay, oh okay, okay. Close your eyes. Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company. yeah! Can you believe... cause I know paper. I know everything there is to know about paper. Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline. Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes. Close them. Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this? Obviously. Oh, agreed, mmm, except... Jim. what are you doing? Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week? No, of course not. But now I want everybody. Jim! Jim? Buddy, Hey! Buddy, Jimbo? Did you have time to think about my offer? So which way are you leaning? Oh no. I'm going with him. I'm going. Alright, okay. Deal! Okay, well... Jim? Probably. Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here. Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom! Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call. Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it. Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer. It is 1-3-4, Kev! [Kevin runs to the phone] Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? [Charles sees Stanley with his crossword, Charles stares and he puts it away] Thank you. So, umm... What? This is how I breathe. Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front. No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear "yes". Cool! What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game? Well, it's not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs] Yeah? Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it. Wow. You can be so modest sometimes. Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around. Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table. Okay. See you on the field, there, bro. See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait! Miner - [kicking a piece of trash] ...sees his partner - Halpert. He looks up! Defending duo! He sets him up! [Jim moves the piece of trash with his hands] He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho! Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you. Jim. What do you play? Forward or half? Okay, striker, huh? Let's see what you got in those legs! Alright. [Dwight blows whistle in Jim's face] No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff. Why'd you duck, Jim? Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment? Does that make you feel better? Huh? It's Britney b*tch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company. [tries to parallel park, hits car.] Okay. Not gonna make this one. [drives away revealing plenty of space for the Cruiser] So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could... Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in] Hey Jim can I get a, um- Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me. Yeah. Okay. What the hell's a rundown? As soon as possible. Just get it right. How would we know that? Use it in a sentence. Try another sentence. I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important. Why don't you just ask him-- You started on that rundown yet? [Looks at Jim's screen.] Oh. Okay, great. Just keep it simple. You're working hard? On this? Right. I mean why work harder than you should. No thanks. Hey I'm here to see Charles. Well, at least you're still being honest with me. Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list. Do I need to? What's that? The one I have. I'll use the one I have. We're getting pretty good at it.[Pam and Ryan throw cheese puffs to Michael, Ryan and Michael throw cheese puffs at each other, Michael throws a cheese puff over his shoulder to Ryan, all three throw cheese puffs to one another, give high-fives][Pam yawns, two cheese puffs thrown at her, one sticks in her hair] The timeline's messy. Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing. What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there? It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down. When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance. I know a few things about love. Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things. Is it Stanley? 'Noishe.' That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know? And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim's fist] Ah, what'd you do that for? [fist pound each other] Totally. Hey, Jim. Bro, I do that all the time. Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok? Well, so what? Your body's a ten. Jim. [hugging a crying Jim] Okay, okay. Hey, guys. Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen] Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here? Uh, that's not what was- Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming? Would you let Charles know that David is here, please? Jim, hey. Uh. When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child. He didn't know any better. You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, "Drive, kid. I trust you." I say we fill Michael's office with bees. My apiarist owes me a favor. Yeah. [opens phone] Hey. I saw you called. We have maybe a month. I don't know what I'm gonna do. That's what Michael said. I like it. [over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up. This is Dwight, by the way. No. There's a lot I haven't done. Yes. Yes, I was gonna say the same thing. We should buy him out. Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him. You think they'd be up for hearing an offer? Yeah. No, Jim... I think you should go. [knocking on door] Hmm? We're not hiring, Jim. Listen, I can't make you laugh right now. Oh, that's nice. Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl-- No-- We don't have-- Maybe. Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks. That's a pun. They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money. That can only mean one thing. They're desperate. Which can only mean one thing. They're total failures. Quiet you. So how long can they stay viable? I'm gonna answer Charles first. You two are morons. Take it up with Toby. What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward. And I want you to reflect. And I want you to say something different. We're in crisis mode here, do you understand? The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together. And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone. No, you're too close. No, I'm not saying we do those things. I'm saying something like those things. Words will never be enough. No, pictures are too interpretive. Oh. Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim. Oh, I totally see your point. Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly. So uh, meeting is over, I guess. I'll see everyone upstairs. I do? Well--Where is that bowl? Michael Scott Paper Company only. I will--no, no. I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom. It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh? Sometimes it's best just to say out of it. [playing chess with Jim] No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do this, I'm gonna do that. You don't want to do that. So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter. I thought you were gay. Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute? I need your help. This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head. You're close with Pam too. Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice. I like his hair. Okay. That sounds pretty biased. Okay. Pam, pros. I like her. I think that she is a fast learner. Cons, she doesn't always follow through. Sh--New York and the whole art school thing. And Roy. She has a weird voice. I don't need to tell you that. I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam. Okay. So be it, then you've lost credibility. And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan. Oh, wow! Whoa! Not cool, Dwight. [Dwight continues laughing] Sure. We're getting married today. Tell 'em how it happened. And very expensive. You can't leave anyone out. Ok, just get to the good part. Funk is the problem and the solution. No... cleaning... up. They're beautiful. Yeah. You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand. Really? This is so cheesy. I like cheesy. Yeah. I think maybe I want a "wedding" wedding. Really? [phone rings, whispering] Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back. 00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes. [changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork. Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates g*n] Yeah! Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right? Okay. Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics. Tell them what happened last year. No, no, that guy who h*t on me. Yeah, you don't grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance. Jim. Pam. Nice day, huh? Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. [walks away] Do you want me to b*at him up for you? Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right? [serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win! [falls] Oof! Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health. I guess that's it for you, Jim. I can't wait. Eight? [walking on Pam's desk, then Jim's desk] Extreme! Parkour! [talking head with Jim] We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant. Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum. Nope. Can't back out now, Halpert. Pays five million dollars. Nudity required. [giddy, whispering] Did you hear Stanley's having an affair? Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser... [grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved. [to Jim] Tuna, how come you never try to set me up? Women friends? Not guy friends? No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women. But off the record, I'm kinda confused. Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like... Yeah, right? How? Right-o. Ohh... Alright. [looks around uneasily] Well hey... Congratulations to you. [chuckles] Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro. Why did that come into your brain? [grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second? Who did you tell? [to Phyllis and Stanley] What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin? [entering conference room] Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors. Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator] Don't... get... on. Do not. [sighs] The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that... I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought "Oh, she has a new bra with padding." But then I thought "Pam doesn't need padding." It just didn't add up, Jim. How far along? Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair. Yes. Jim... Yes. A week? A month? A year? Did you pee on a stick? Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God. No, no, I can do this. Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over. [picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified] Hold on a second, Cynthia. Okay, Jim you wanna h*t the conference room? Oh right, this thing. I remember now. [whispers to Jim] What's this about? [walks into conference room on his cell phone, interrupting David and Jim] Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired. Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now. I will... I love you too. Bye. Alright, well I should go. Thanks for this. You've given me a lot to think about. Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak. Ummm... okay, here's the thing though. The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you. I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer. We may have to replace him. Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second. [shakes jelly beans] Little pick me up? [Jim accepts] Oh those are the best. Little sugar rush. Well we did talk about how handsome you are. Oh what a week, God. We said... I know there were certain things we said... Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out. Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy. Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion. Yes! Yes. Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face. Alright, Just do it. I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam, [starts to choke up] and now I don't wanna lose the baby. That's what she... Oh, oh, well here he is right now. [Michael knocks on desk] Come in. [Makes sound effects for door opening and footsteps and points to Jim to answer] We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton. Both of you guys working as co-managers. Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff. What's happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together. Jim Halpert, welcome. [in Jim's office] Sign this. Sign it. [in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint. You! One minute ago. Angry. No. No. No. Wait, stop writing that. That is not true. Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while. Yes? Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes? Welcome. Mm-hmm. Disruptive. No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important. Let's do. N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim? Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets... At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are. Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust. You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea. Yes. Alright. No more meetings this week. Mm-hmm? Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each. Stanley, you don't need to answer that. "If you don't smell this, you're fired." What do you mean by "these people"? Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room. Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want. What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time] No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people. That is not what Wallace told us. It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around. Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just-- Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision. Excuse me? Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it? Very good. Talk to you later-- [Jim hangs up] Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. [sighs, and claps hands once] Alright, I am looking forward to this. I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore. All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are. You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it. No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim. Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way? You use your brain too much. Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all. As I was saying it. [in nerdy voice] Con-- you look like a nerd. Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds. Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there. Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! "Mrs. Pam Halpert!" That's the first time I've seen it in writing! That will not go over well. Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna k*ll myself. No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue. And then another-- Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are. Ha! That-- I am not known for that! Yes! You went over my head to Wallace! Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me? Ah. Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?! Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? [laughs] You call it. [to the camera] This had better be terrible. Wait. Seriously?! Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with. Well? This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?! What the hell?! [everyone complaining at Jim] You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct... What about a raise based on merit? Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best. Are you making a-- Yep. [to camera] It's going really well, actually. Toby. Just wanted to draw a picture of him. Alright! Who to pick? [walking around the table] Who to pick? I... will skip a turn. Jim? [in Jim's office] How you doing? Oh, what are you usually? Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero. I know, I know. Yes, we did. Come on! This isn't fair! [at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this! You're welcome. Gin. [toast, sip] I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room? [standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding] What do you think? I spent all morning on it. It's just a really important day for me. Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day. So... you're going to provide them, then? Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding. Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers. Thank you, Dwight. [in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat. She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points. Yeah. Oh. No. No. That's not how it works. Halpert... Great. Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed. [laughs] Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word. Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and-- [talking quietly, trying not to move his lips]That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives. Well... I wouldn't care to live if I thought that. I'd like you to meet Christy Kelly. And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh. Yeah. Go ahead. Douche. Like... a year. What's obvious? Why can't Pam drink? Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation. When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation. Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word. Jim. That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it. I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me. Hey, smooth guys. Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning. [on the phone] Hey, hey! Where are you? Can you take Andy to the hospital? He tore his scrotum dancing. He is in my room icing his b*lls. Please stop saying what. Can you take him? Your brothers took you out drinking? That's Michael. You're out with Michael? [over phone] Hey-O! Okay, fine. I'll take him. Are you pushing me off the phone? Congratulations. No, it didn't--nothing got torn off. Who told you that? Okay great. [Isabel kisses her cheek] Yeah, I'll see you in a second. [pauses] Wait, what? [tries to follow, but veil gets caught on wall and tears] Oh! Oh no! Can you come here please? Hey. Terrible. My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels-- [sighs] Thank you. No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and-- [Jim cuts off half his tie] Where were you guys? Do you know how long I've been waiting here? [walks up] Yes! Yes! I have so much joy... in my heart... right now. How do I look? Saw it. I'm not gonna lock my door. [door closes. Then clicks locked] Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon. It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this. Just get in the car. Jim? Oh thank God. It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier. Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend. Okay! Jim? Are you? What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said. No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again! No! Oh my God! No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you! How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic? It really was. [voice cracks] I'm so happy for you... Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot. They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam! [reaching out with hands at chest level] This conversation has two items on the agenda. Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations! I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years. I have recently taken a lover. Pam's mom. Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding? About what? Oh, big time. She drives a green camry. And the seats go all the way down. All the way down. [laughs] What? Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright? [walks in] Hey, Jim. What did I do? I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy. Okay, I have a good thing with the mom- She's right on my way home from work. I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam. Pam, we're all set. [Pam places candy on Erin's desk] Yum. Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock? Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we? Come on, it'll take two seconds. Come on. [sighs] I don't deserve this, guys. No, I don't. [long exhale] Oh, that's too bad. Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here. [outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy! Thank you. You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott. Sure thing, Tuna Boss. [in Jim's office] How may I be of service to you? [both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke. What are you thinking? Haha! Ha ha ha. I have some ideas about conservation... [on phone] What's it... why are you crying? I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor. Hold on, hold on, what's going on? [to Jim] What! You knew? You know what it means. Shut it! I don't need to be friends with Pam. I have plenty of female friends. My mom, Pam's mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on IM, what's her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week. Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even... [walks into Jim's office and takes out ear piece] I'm sorry. Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me. Oh, I'm equipped... I can... Don't tell Michael... Night Erin. [looking out the window at Dwight washing the car] Awww, he did that for me? Mmmm. Haha, yeah. Say more nice things. Maybe I'm overreacting. But I don't think I am. Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha... [bumps into something] ... ha ha ha. You're not as scary as Book Face, over there. ...and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival. Sounds like fun. You guys would love it. They have a TCBY booth. The same stuff you get downtown. Do you like TCBY? I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour. They said the both of you. You should give them a call. Check that out. Jim's a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional? Wha- what? Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand. I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright. Let me get your stroller. What are you gonna call him? No. What is his name? Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal. Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing? ...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a t*nk. I highly recommend you wear that. They are into style. They are into appearance. We are selling success. That's sorta secondary. [offers Jim the watch again] Nope. No. Why isn't Jim wet? Nothing. Cocoa. Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond? No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying. [Stanley laughs] Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy? Message received, little soy bean. No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'. Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail. I want to make fun of you right now. No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid. Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over. Hey, let's watch this thing. How can we not watch this? We're not mocking, we're watching. No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this. No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't f*re all of you. It's alright. I can handle it. Oh. Did - did you see that? Why'd you stop it? Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in. I don't think you froze. No. Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But- Oscar's a douche. No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok. [holds door open as they exit] Oh, you guys. Just one second. [picks up phone] Oh my gosh! Are you serious? Shipping emergency. I don't think I can go to lunch. I know. Isn't that always how it goes? I want to handle it. I feel like its-- Well, you know-- Michael and I were-- talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales. What table should we take? So many to choose from. Well, as long as you're running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one. Let's see your six months pregnant, but you've only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to? Please be Grandma. Ok, there's a penny. What's that from? It was from the wishing well at the mall. You threw it in. I went back later, waded in and I found it. [reading] I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay... Home run Michael. [covering eyes] Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who-- who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I've never-- I don't know him. There's another woman. And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping. Well, hobbies-- Hey. Do you and Pam ever get frisky? I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other? Really? She strong? Can you stop this? Okay. I don't either. Mmm-hmm. I know. You gotta do something-- How much time do you think you'll need? You're okay. [screaming, Phyllis and Dwight wrestling] Got you! Broken arm! Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom! Ha, gonna flip you! How can I pose this to you in a relatable way? You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are att*cked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives? You cannot go wrong with a throat punch [screams, pretends to punch Meredith in the throat] False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me! That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present. Easy. Allow me to demonstrate. I am attacking myself with a throat punch. Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch] Block. Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist] Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both att*ck and defend himself] Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you're not. Ow! Oh! He really is, but not for long. [steps on foot] Ow! Instep, oh, not again. [more screaming] You let go, you let go. Oh, you're right, I can't hold on. It's $1.99 to finish the article. I wonder what it was going to say? [no one makes a move to pay for the article] I like Erin. There, I said it. I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws. OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody. Anything new on YouTube? Doesn't even need to be good. Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins. Monkey see, monkey do. Monkey pee all over you. Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room] Here's the deal guys. There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working. Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better. I only slack off when things are good. [Michael leaves] He needs me. Seat saved infinity. [leaves] It is so much fun. Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it... This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about m*rder. Tube City, you owe me one. That is the way Southern people talk. [tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks. We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt. We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern. [accent] Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection. We still don't know who the m*rder is. [everyone leaves] Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here. I can't do this myself. Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do? Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation. Let's listen up. Don't just say things. [accent] I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon. We need to reopen this case. I think Michael may have snapped. Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck? Both. They're both worse. [comes into Jim's office using accent] Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors? To Mama Juju Boo Boo. Hey shut up. You're dead. No Michael here, my name is- Caleb! No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room. I'll take it. Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late. Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet. But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good. We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year. Insolvent. So, well... You know what? I'm sorry, I have to run. But we will talk soon, OK? You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great. Keep after it, but I gotta run. Thanks Jim. [Jim comes out of the office] What's the news? Well, I guess that's not- A m*rder, you say? I do declare. Do we have to play? Get in there! One, two, three.. [all scream] 00. [accent] It wasn't me. I'm not goin' down for this! Bow down before Recyclops. Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter? Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin? Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns. Recyclops will have his revenge. The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child. A world where you truly can be anything you want. [the limo driver raises the divider window] Who's playing with the button? Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under. The company's probably going under, though. Seems like it's leaning one way. Definitely. So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff? In these uncertain times, Michael has managed to maintain steady profits from his Scranton branch. We all thank you, Michael. [scattered applause] Another bright spot in the Dunder Mifflin landscape, our new waste pulp re-purposing plant in Milford. [applause] Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy. Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things. It's not like you can f*re people or anything. Sorry. Plastered. Stuff gets around. I don't participate. Does and email count? Yeah. [everyone raises hands again] I don't know, man. I just don't know. Can you actually f*re people? Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone. Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'. Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. [crowd starts to agree and perk up] 45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. [crowd applauds] And you can take that to the bank. [applause continue] And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. [crowd has gotten very excited and is cheering] I love you, New York! [Michael does the spin and leaves the stage - then runs back across the stage] You. You. [playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist... That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version. Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it? What? Great. Yep, that is a problem. Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim. Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away. [Oscar stands there stunned] Mmm-hmm. I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight. Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything. Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news. The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays. 0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat! Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron. Great! [sits down] Must be hackers. What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend? Lurk much? [Erin leaves] I miss Pam. Is that what we're going for now? "okay?" We used to go for "pretty good." Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better. I'm not in this for the trophies, but... Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month. Hey Jimmy, what's up? Cool. Very cool. I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office. That laugh is so infectious. I didn't mean any of those things I just said. And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud. Make it about the work. This encompasses all available data. Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation. Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency. Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize. In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching. I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data. [crying] Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, no! I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not? To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us. Yes! Yeah, you said "In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize." Isn't that what you said? Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. They're lithium. Correction. It was my idea. Yup. Hi, I have an order here for a custom cake, Jim Halpert. That's a lot of zeroes. Jim, what the hell is happening there? Yes. Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife? Am I missing something? Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier. If you can't do that, we're going to have a separate discussion. What? What? Oh, you're kidding me! Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. [yelling] Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of-- --the party planning committee... Hey, Rockefeller Center! Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that. Ugh. Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight! [others join] Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ... You didn't decorate it? Exactly. Is it, is it fake? Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die... What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong? Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa? Phyllis? Take it back. That is absurd. No? No! Jim! Come on! It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on! Well? The only Santa. You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved! No no no. Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun! Whoop! Okay, what? Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless! Do you understand, you forced my hand? Oh, do we? Do "We?" Is that what "we" want? Why don't "we" take a vote on it? Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are-- Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis. [on microphone] What? Was I not supposed to say it? [Jim unplugs mic] What? Turn it back on. Hey. How's everybody doing? You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas. And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, "How could they do this to us?" WHAT? You are kidding me! He said, we have been sold. [upset murmurs] Come on! David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone. I'll call him. I'll call David. I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don't know. It's real slippery out here. [sound of drummer's starts] Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert. In training. Hey. Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away. We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into. We're hoping our interview seals the deal. You'll find it easy to embrace the Sabre spirit. Welcome. We're very excited to go on this journey with you. You know what? Let me see what I can do. There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here? What? Who? The - The guy we're meeting with? Hi Jerry. Good to see you. Come on in. My office is right back here. This is the play room. Oh, so you saw it already? [cell phone rings] Oh. Got to take this. Sorry. Ok, you've got to pull it together. He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird. Sorry about that. Right this way. Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside. [drumming intensifies] Outside. That seems a bit premature, don't you think? I don't even know if I have a space for you yet, and you're already lining up your holiday plans. Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom? Seriously? You told her? And you - you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going? I'm being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be as charming as you think you are? It doesn't lock for the children's safety. Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job. Whoa, whoa! Yeah. I think I understand. Each of you is doing half a job. This is knucklehead talk. I'm not gonna bite it, you know. You can't give me gravy and tell me it's jelly, because gravy ain't sweet! Is it, Jim? I humbly accept the management position. those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now. Well, I'm gonna let this marinate. So you can go. So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year. This is way more than I make now. I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women. Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk? What? What? Really? Really? Well, I think you're both being a little too modest. No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people. [pointing to the window in Michael's office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown! Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? [Michael's phone rings] Michael Scott, head of sales. Who's hungry? 30 and say "Who's hungry?" Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy? It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain. Oh sure. Hey. You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here. Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch. I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here. We make a poster that says "Happy Opposite Day!" and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black. Lethal w*apon? What? What I'm saying... Fine. I don't care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it. [gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy. Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales. I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor. If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors. Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car... Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money. Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too. Ooh, spooky. But why? 00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out. Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet. No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes. Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks. Five minutes apart. Okay, stop watching me. Mm-hmm. My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book. No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore. I'm going to go look at the Internet. For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast! Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times. Stick spicy food up her butt. Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions. Why don't you go do some work? I know, you don't like to be frazzled. Okay. I think he is. Absolutely not. Hey. I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital. Okay, Jim. Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay? I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait... Oh, God, don't be mad. Mm-hmm. I know. Good. Okay. Oh, yeah, my water broke. Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital. That's right, let's do this. Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine. They're not that bad still, babe. No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay. No, it's passing, it's fine. Ah, no, it passed. It's good. Okay, I'm not going. I'm not... It's fine. [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it. Are you kidding? You can do this. You can do this. I'm petrified. Yeah. We're going to have a baby. Let's do that. Two minutes apart. Oh, God. Oh, no. It's okay. I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon. No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops. No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it. Yes. [as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] "We" don't. By the bushes? I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends. Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on. Wait, wait. My iPod's not in here! It has the birth song on it! Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack. I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it. It's only twenty minutes past the hospital! Okay. Do you have everything, guys? Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay. [he throws the keys into bushes across the street] I just did. Daddy? She's ready to push. Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go. Not yet. You're starting, you're kinda losing them. [with Jim, holding the baby] She's incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again? Guys, guys! Eleven pounds... Hi there. Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee. Ooh, somebody has a full diaper. Oh. Let me get it. Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael. Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents? How we doing? She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You've been through a lot. [as the baby yawns] Oh, big yawn. One, and then wrap around. It's okay. Hold that arm down. She's not gonna... Just... Go. Nurse! I don't know. I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything. Doesn't feel right. How does one do that? Do you want to try it, Jim? Somebody buzzed? Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay? Alright. Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies. Hey, guys. We're short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy. Hi, so sorry. I know. Um, yeah, that would be great. Okay. Okay, well. Feel how I'm flicking the nipple? Like that? Stimulate it. Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh... And you can just... The baby should grab on to that. Okay. So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if... Yes, congratulations. Okay. Oh, sh**t. sh**t, she fell off. Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick? Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it. [trying to sleep as the baby cries] Jim, Jim, get her. Get the baby. Get her. Come on. I got her. Okay. Okay. Okay... Jim! She latched! She latched. Oh, my God. I didn't even have to do the "C thing." Aw, we're doing it. We're really parents now. Oh, hey, Isabelle. Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety... Oh, my God! Wrong baby! Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Sshh. No, not at all. Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di... Bottles are fine. A lot of babies grow up using bottles. So are you excited to bring your baby home? 35. Twenty five minutes. And you're all set with the car seat? That bottom part needs to go in the car. Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes. Do that. Yeah. Mm-hmm... Where's your car? Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around. Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it. Hi. We did it. Welcome back, "Dad!" Welcome back Tuna! Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks. Mega-Desk. Command central. Surveillance, gaming- and business. Oh, I love this, so much fun! There's such team spirit in this room! 'Morning Darling! Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to "How I Met Your Mother" that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them. Great. Thank you. [hangs up phone] Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please? They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy! It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic. Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life? Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now. What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on. I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father. I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother. [laughs] I'll be over there. [Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you. My headphones are broken. Can I listen to my music at a low volume? Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-" "- and the man in the moon. When you coming home Dad? I don't know when-" "-But we'll be together then-" "-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then." [Vocalizes and continues song] "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon" [Singing, Dwight supplies beats] "Little boy blue and the man in the moon." "When you coming home Dad? "I don't know when-" "But we'll get together then, we're gonna have a good time-" [On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home. Hello? Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. [Meredith joins behind Packer] What the hell is going on back there? What the hell is this? This is not Mega-Desk. That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks. Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. [holds up photo] Do you know who that is? Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans... [laughs] I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp. In my condo complex. I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie. [feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl? Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim. No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens? Yeah. Well, it wasn't him. I know, I know. I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman. Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque. [Jim stands in corner, texting] Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you. You writing your memoirs over there? Well, it's a pretty big check. Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people. I'm just saying, that - Thank you very much. Ah, just the stupid leads. I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis. Hey. Mm-hmm. Okay. [passes Jim some index cards] Alright. Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic? I do understand it. [over phone] Hey baby, what's up? Nothing but vomit and diapers over here. Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more. Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair. He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca. What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car] Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.' The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha. [to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't - Why? What drama? So unnecessary. I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that? Don't use your cute baby to make us like you. If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly. I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India. All those who agree, say aye [all present - Stanley, Andy and Phyllis - raise their hands] All those opposed - What's the least we can do to make this okay? That is a dangerous precedent. Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one. So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you - [stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty. Do you have any pastries without fruit? [enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our - Oh, what did you do today? [from desk chair] Oh, come on! Excuse me. A bunch of us are talking about happy hour. Oh, baloney. Ring her up. Absolutely, I will do that right now. I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much. [through phone] It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God! Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie. I want her to meet Michael. They're both single, I have a sense they might- Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God! [laughs] It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party... Sucks to be you. That would be sublime. I was a little nervous when Pam told me he was her boss, but he doesn't act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we'd never get anything done. About what? She's nice. Yeah. Uh, yeah, sure. About what? Hey, Michael, where have you been? [Michael sh**t pool ball up into their faces] Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning? [tries to wink] Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy! I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue. We both-you didn't dup- Maybe it should come from a man. You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop? Yeah. Okay. Bye. Oh-oh, gosh. Oh. Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady. [at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn't have watered it? [feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha. Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable. Jim does a really good one. Do yours. Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV? What? What do you mean, suspend me? I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension. I don't get it. Buenos dias, Jaime. [removes post-it, leaves] Uhh! You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] "I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee." If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives? This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together. We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes. Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott. Hi! I have a sense about these things. I knew it. You should see their baby. [barges in] Hi. Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret? Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me. [in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread? I'll have one. Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam. What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim? What? Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways. Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale. Is this... is this the best you can do right there? Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, [removes sweater revealing her revealing top] where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like. So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right? Maybe wee find some wiggle room? Why don't you run them again? Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says "no," then she is not interested. You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together? I was after your money. Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time. Okay, some for, some against. Um... I think it's really, really unlikely. Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible. I'm going with Pam's group. Here we go. Okay. No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck. Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work. Stop it! You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha! [chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you. Jim. Are you clicking a detonator? Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world. Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit. All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news. Oh!... It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God. Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update. Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life. Uh, Franklin Mills. Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael. [gasps] Did she see me? No. No! How about make-believe land has anything you want? I don't think he'd do that. Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big. No, I gotta go. Text me later. Me too! We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby. We can watch a movie and play Rock Band. He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him. [ahem][Pam snores] Guys? You were supposed to be the Lookout. I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad. Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics. Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else. I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. [Jim and Pam struggling to stay awake] Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way? You love it. There ya go. Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks. I don't think I'm gonna make it. [shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later. Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place. Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay? Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times. Yes. It was me. Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare... She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on f*re, spontaneously! Her husband's a reporter. So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do. I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael. All right. Sounds good. Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim. Gabe, I told you all about the printers. Okay, look, I get it, people. I'm the lame IT guy, and everybody hates me. You called me man? I just said my name just now, did you forget it already? All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library? So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper? [singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] Whassup! [Strains, grunts] What? OK. All right. See you later. I have an important question for you. Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday? Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. What? Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate. You can't do that. Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ. No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin. OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him? And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O. Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do. Yeah. So when are we going out? Hey, man. OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes. It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going. Yeah, yeah. Just tell her I'll talk to her later. No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do. Hey. Hey. Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with... It's better, thanks. Yeah. Is...? Um... Are you... Yes. Yeah. Great. Let me just... Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend. Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of b*at me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited. That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, "100% post-consumer content." What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second. Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually. Retaliation. Tit for tit. Well, it should be. This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right? Yeah, Freecell. I know. I saw that. I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch. Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please? It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day. "I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..." Open-mindedness, is that even a word? "...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck." [Laughing] He's going to lose it when he reads that. OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim? ...empathy, respect... [Phone ringing] Jim! Jim! You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too expl*sive. No pun intended. But I just though. "Too soon for Arabs." Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court. Chappelle's Show. I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space. Great. She's cute, huh? Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch. [trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority. That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice. [stirs] Mmmm. Oh. Sorry. That's fine. I'm doing it right now. To you. No. I have a life. You should try it sometime. There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers. Yeah! Really? Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this? Yes. I can do it. I'm your man. Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office. Same thing. Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior. Oh gee, then why do I have an office? Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it. Sure. Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system. OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do. OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so... I'm inventing new diseases. So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that? Nice. All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them. Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony. You did this, didn't you? Yes you did. I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one! The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] "Count Choculitis" Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula? I think you need to confess... ...the fact... What are you doing? Those are my keys. [looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green... Let me out. Let me out or you're fired. Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk. [on phone] Hey, Jim. It's Pam. Good, how are you? Busy? Um, I'm not bothering you, am I? You don't have anything you're doing? Jim! I might go to the mall. I need new shoes. Do you want to form, an alliance, with me? Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected... Did you get your tickets? The g*n show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep] An alliance? What does that even mean? I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure. Did you tell Pam about the alliance? Just now. Right, that's good, good, pursue this. Mmm hmm. Done. They seem awfully chummy, don't you think? Only one way to find out. I'm on it. What? I believe it. I could tell, from the body language. Italian. Yeah. Good, let 'em. It helps our cause. I love their sandwiches. Their bread's really good. Damn it. God! God... Damn it! Why us? [whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second? Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues? Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, "These people are my friends." But he's all like, "This is confidential. You can't tell anybody." But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything. Jackpot. You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time. Oh my God, we have to be there. No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God. I know. I know exactly what to do. This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything. Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet. So tape it down. Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box. Happy birthday... No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone. He's in a box? Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal. Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time. No, don't. Don't do that. Oh, tell me, tell me. OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no. [laughing] That's perfect! [yelling] What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert? Hey, Hey! Come on. It's just office pranks. So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim. [on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years. Uh, [in a nerdy voice] "I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword." Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that. Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now. I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance. Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? [Dwight holds the kit up] How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you. Basketball? It was kind of my thing in high school. And I'm, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. You know, I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here. Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones. Yeah, you're gonna need it. Whoa. [laughing] I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive. And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so... Um, I think I'm gonna be up at the lake. Hey, there he is! Secret w*apon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go! OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you b*at us, you're fired. That's a joke. OK, let's do it. OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy. Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut! [Michael looks away and misses Jim's pass] Whoa! What's going on? What's going on? You're playing like a bunch of girls. What the hell man? [laughing] You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word. Mmm-hmm. Hey, Jimmy what do you think of that little purse girl, huh? Why don't you get on that? What are you gay? What is your type? Stay away from my mom. Engaged, yeah. Pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems. Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot. Assistant to the Regional Manager. That's true. True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name. Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know? They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions. What's that? I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls. No. Like those? Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going... No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go. [smiles] [mimicing Katy] Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that. Oh! Oh... Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad. [whispering] Here he comes, shhh... [smiles in agreement] Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons? [nods] That's what he said. Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you. Hi. I'm Katy. You sit out there, don't you? Okay, um... Okay. [laughs] [Under his breath] Still. I'm bored. No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend? Really? What are you guys going to do? That's great. That's cool. I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move. 'Cause Roy's got a truck. Uh, huh. Yes. Great. Okay, I'm gonna head back. See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim. Where you going? Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool. Thanks. Take it easy. You got that? Good. Here. Squeeze it inside. Why? It's a... it's a very nice car. Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. [holds up a trophy of a business man] And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, "Hey, did you get an award?" And the neighbor will say, "No man. I mean, I sl*ve all day and nobody notices me." Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So... [in a Fat Albert voice] Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert. So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera? I'm not changing that, it's the best one. That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier. You staying? [in a stereotypical oriental accent] Herro everybodeeee. I'm gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould. Oh no, I just, I decided to stay. I'll just get a ride home from Angela. Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping. No. No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink! [laughs] Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom. Woo! Hey, I haven't gotten one yet! More Dundies!Pam and Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman. [Pam hugs Michael and gives him a quick peck on the cheek] Oh! Thank you. What a great year for the Dundies. We got to see Ping. [Pam nods] And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. [Pam nods] Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. [Pam nods] Which for me, has ruined them for life. [looks at Pam, who is staring at him, nodding][Jim looks at the camera, then back at Pam, who is still nodding] Nothing. What? I don't know, what?[Pam starts laughing, then suddenly falls off the bar stool] Oh my God! You are so drunk! Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy. Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush- Oh my God! I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!! Whoa. I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall. No you don't. Hey, um, can I ask you a question? Um, I just wanted to say thanks. Not really a question. [starts to laugh] Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.[Jim opens the door for her] Bye. [clears throat] Hey, what's up? Any emails today? No? Um... Check your spam folder. What? [laughs uncontrollably] Kay. Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button. Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything. [monkey noises] I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody. mmhmm. Oh really? Ok, you know, Michael... I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim? Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things. Mmmhmm. Yes. Maybe. You see Dwight's coffee mug? Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it. Here. Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight. Oh. [paper football lands on desk] Ooh. Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know. Eh. It's a scoreboard. Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out. Or when we're bored. We're bored a lot. Sweet! We call it Hate Ball. Because of how much Angela hates it. Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... [turns around] no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home. Let's go check out the master bedroom. Yeah, I got a game. It's called "work hard so my kids can go to college." Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin. It smells like cookies. I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work. Uh. [breathes deeply, head at knees] Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton. In English, box of paper snowshoe racing. The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens. I'll do it. Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs] Pair of shoes! It's Phyllis! Flonkerton. [empties bowl of M&M's into his mouth] Apparently. Are you calling me a ho? OH! I did. I made something for our closing ceremonies. a*t*matic voicemail. Ow. Go! Go! Go! What is going on? That's my stopwatch. Great. I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid? I have 59 voicemails. Sure. Really? Cool. Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on? Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly. You know. What's this? I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment. Yep, not as good as gold. [national anthem plays] Why are you playing the national anthem? Oh. [doves move across cord] What the hell is that? Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Sure, can I ask who's calling? Just a second. Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess they're like going out, or dating, or something. And, uh... I don't know! You know? They're just... She calls him, and they... You know, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm talking really loud. Am I talking really loud? [to Jim] Hey! You can just give her your extension. I don't want to be like "a guy" here. You know? Like, Stanley is the "crossword puzzle guy". And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the "something guy". Ooh. ...Would You Rather? [to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a... A Purpose Driven Life. No. The DaVinci Code! is there f*re wood on the island? Then I would bring an axe, no books. Fine. Physician's Desk Reference. Yeah. Okay. Thought people read more books. Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County... Legends of the Fall? Well, I kind of liked Legal... I take it back. I take it back! You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me. Okay. Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused... Yes. In my top three, so suck it. Breakfast Club. Um... The Princess Bride and... No, my all time favorite! All time favorite. I'm really uncomfortable. Present company excluded? Pam. ["Everybody Hurts" by R.E.M.] Think you've had too much / in this life. Okay, um... Everybody hurts, Why didn't I go to business school? The temp. Dwight. I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway. Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins. Hey! Guys, what's going on? Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do? [clears his throat] Hi! How are you? I'm good. It's good to see you. I'm hungry. Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers. Um, for the... the desert island. I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car. Okay. Alright! You want to drive? [eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be? That's great! Okay, greatest strength. But that doesn't sound good. Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types] He's a g*n nut. [on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim's attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott. Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job. Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge. Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God. [clearing his throat and interrupting Jim's talking head] Can I speak to you a minute? Um... yes. Help. Me. I want you to role play f*ring me. I want you to f*re me, and I will take it. Yes. I want you to be me, and I will be Creed. No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head. Yes, that's a good idea. Aaaahh! I'm gonna k*ll myself! I'm going to k*ll myself, and it's your fault! Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month. I... this is Creed. I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings] And I'm very angry, and I want... I'm gonna k*ll you. I'm going to k*ll you for f*ring me. What happened? Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was... Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out. [motions for her to follow him] Come on. Where is my desk? This is not funny. This is totally unprofessional. I didn't lose my desk. Okay, who moved my desk? Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished! [In bathroom, answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times. It's by the ream? ...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%. Wash your hands, Kevin. [Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai... Dwight... Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai. No, that was my Sensei. I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei. Assistant Sensei. Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell? What's her address? [Ryan's cell phone rings] [Reading Jim's palm] You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks. I am just following the website. Yes, you have very nice teeth. [in a high pitched voice] This is Mike Tyson. Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me. Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you. Ok, give that back to me. No. That is not a toy. Please? No women or children, unless provoked. Warehouse guy. Doesn't count. Because I would kick his ass. So? I've beaten up black belts. And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again. Just h*t me. You'll see. Oh, q*eer... [realizes he is on camera] eye. q*eer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it. Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass. Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not. I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World w*r II veteran. k*lled 20 men then spent the rest of the w*r in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight. I don't know. French Onion? Ok. Ok, alright, where is Dwight? You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now. why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools. Oh. What? Well, look closer. Once point for me. Oh, you're dead. Later Jim. [entering office] Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet? I've got Michael's lucky tie. Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals... She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out. What is going on? No, they had to come back for me. Wait, not Roy. Say it's not your fiance. [laughs] Sure. There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse. It is a screenplay. Starring himself. Of the FBI. What is that? [to waitress] Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please? Yeah, yeah. That's the character's name? Ok, you guys should not be doing this. You took something that doesn't belong to you. Brought it in here- Made copies of it- [singing] Chili's baby back ribs... [looks around conference room] You're joking right? Michael's movie? Two thumbs down. [Smiles] Heh. Ok, you know what? I am done with this. That's it, the end. Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now. Yeah. You said "World, this is my blood! It's red, just like yours. So love me!" I had plans to meet a friend tonight. Which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer. For the bugs. Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan? What are you going to do with your time off? [points to Jim's iPod] You have new music? And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. [to camera] Jan, I defend your honor. [to Dwight] Is that all? What!? Oh, I don't know... [Jim laughs, phone rings] Oh my God. This is Jan's cell. do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don't know. That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship. It's, uh, [phone rings] Excuse me. Hello? Hi! Just talking about you. The camera? No. Uh huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What. Ok. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No. [to camera] Would you excuse me? [to Jan] No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm. No, no. [goes under his desk] This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have. Right. No. Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people. Only other people. Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk [to camera which is now under desk] Excuse me? Excuse me?! [to Jan] I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no. I didn't slip you something! Oh, really? Why might some say that? Uh hmm. We didn't dance. Swaying isn't dancing. I have some faxes to get out. Oh, come on, Pam. I- [bouncing on an exercise ball] You should get one of these. Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts. This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim's desk] Sorry. Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex. Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that. It's only twenty-five bucks. Oh, hey, listen, Jim. Here's a little tip for your performance review. Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders. Oh, yes, we do. Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise. Uh, that is so stupid. What if he gives it to you? Ugh, you know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday. Uh, stupid. Uh, duh. Duh. Michael and Jan definitely made out. Maybe more. Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K? Saturday. Hey, Jim. Oh my God, did you see "The Apprentice" last night? Can you believe who Tr*mp fired? Do you think Michael and Jan actually... How do you come back from that? No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that? As a human being. 20; where the hell's Dwight? It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania. [sees man in a turban outside] Oh my God. Ohhh. [dials phone number] Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. Oh, we have a serious problem here. [goes out onto office floor] Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights. Pretend you're not here. [whispers to Jim] Hey. Something just happened. Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately. I know! Do you think that they're like- No, right, no, no. Of course. Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles. This is a meal in a cup. Yeah! They were the most fun. We always invited them. on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight- I was wondering- Why? Like who? Who doesn't know? Why just Michael? Is it? Oh, that's perfect! I won't. Ok. Really? That's great. Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere. Oh, no, he can't make it. Hey there. Almost quittin' time. One more hour. Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out. You have plans. I do, too. I do, too. I do, yeah. Big plans. Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no. Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds- Yeah. It's the best. It's the best. I would not miss it for the world. But if something else came up, I would definitely not go. It is. Ok. [someone coughs] What? Have fun tonight! Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. [to the camera] He has no idea! You don't work with us. Thanks. Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions. Jim, come here. When is the guest of honor coming? He's gonna love it! Hey. Definitely. Hey, is Katy coming? Huh, is it ok if I call her? Jim's bedroom. Cool... This is your desk. Your home office? Down. You have to sit down so I can get the full effect. Ok, wait, so that would make me [walks to side of room] like right here. And Dwight would be like- Umm, [gasps] yearbook! [finds Jim's picture] Ooooohhh no! You were so dorky! Good, it's good. Good work, everybody. I got sap on me. I'm a vegetarian. [singing] Here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I've ever known... Oh, yeah I gave that up. Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam? You wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please. [singing] Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly? Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside, there was something goin' on. This part goes to the, uh, girl. You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. In every b*at of my heart, we got something goin' on. Tender love is blind---Michael and We're making love!Michael and Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about. You get something good this year? Yeah? Who did you have? I think I got something pretty nice for my guy. I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow. Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond. Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim. That's from me. I don't know. It was so long ago. [opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome. I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap. One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift. I'll take the teapot. Damn it. Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But .. Sorry, I .. Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias. Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big h*t! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets. Cool, cool. Box it up. No trades. "A real man makes his own luck." Billy Zane.Titanic. No. I want it. I'm going to use it. .. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates] Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend. [laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot] I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so .. Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer? Hello. Jim? This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here? Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy. Okay, fine. Where's my wallet? But I don't have any... Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo. A ski mask and a swimsuit. A furnace? All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands! No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on! That's hilarious. Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you? It's getting kind of rowdy down there. Sometimes I just don't get Roy. I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader? Suppose your office building's on f*re. Jim, who would you save? Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her. Do you think that'll ever be us? What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight? Is somebody there? Captain Jack has a problem with authority. He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic. Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged. Roy said the first one didn't count. Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan... Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute. Well, if you like her so much, don't give up. BFD. Engaged ain't married. ...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long. But it's good. No, I want you to pick me up. Ok... I am hurt. I hurt my foot. [exasperated] OH GOD! Oh God! OK, buhhhh, I b*rned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work. I'm coming Michael! I don't have a girlfriend. It was all made up. Just someone come, ok? Anyone. Anyone but Dwight. What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window] Ohhhhhh! He h*t the pole! Oh my gosh. Is he ok? Please stop popping my cast. Thank you. Yep. Ugh, forget it. I'll just get up myself. No! Uh, aaaahhh! Ah! Oh God! No, he's actually been really nice and helpful. While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society. Well they notice it. Don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it? What's wrong with that guy? [hits his head on his desk] Uh, ugh, ohhhh... Oh, ok, that's, great. No, I can't drive. Jim why don't you drive. We'll go. I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please. Choo choo choo choo choo choo... Vietnam sounds. Tired... [Jim grabs spray bottle from planter] Want to take a rake... . Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight. Yeah. g*n! Oh, God, a mini-van. What is Meredith's problem? Where are we going? Where are we going? Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese. I found it under the seat. I'm thirsty. No! Give me the bottle!! Gimme the bottle, Dwight! Just give it! Stop, stop it! Stop spraying! [Dwight whines] Gimme the bottle! [sigh] Something with a "K". What do I write under "reason for visit"? Nothing. I wrote "bringing someone to the hospital". No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok? I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan. Really? Michael went in with him? Wow. Ok, that's uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go. Ok. Bye. Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me. What's up-dog? Good. How are you doing? Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time. It's much sexier. [Pam puts hair back up] [Michael walks by Jim] Man, this must be t*rture for you. Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant. Hey Jim-bag. Really? Who else knows? My lips are sealed. [singing] My lips are sealed... Bangles. Hey, whatcha gettin'? Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night? Any of em? So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the "P" situation? Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda? It's Grrrrrrape! Soda. Ok. So what is the secret Michael? Good. Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick. What are you doin' for lunch? Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat. Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room. Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who. We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers. I'm his boss actually. And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants. What do you like best about Pam? Is it her boobs, or... Really? Never get's any of my jokes. Her boobs, definitely. You put your front side in; you put your front side out. You put your front side in and shake it all about. You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around. That's what it's all about. Whoo, hoo! Woo! Yeah! What did you guys talk about? Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam? Hey. Did you find anything good in your desk? Score. Big day. Big day. Oh. Right. No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started. No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well. So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now? Mmm, hmm. Cool. Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake. I know, I know, I know. I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that [starts to get choked up] this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid. Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just. Yeah I'm good. Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out. [catching Jim looking at him at Pam's desk] What? Oh, nothing. [again catching Jim looking at him] What? [while in his reeking office] I am a big Fear Factor fan. I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape. Um... [clearing throat] I can't stand it [gets up to leave], I can't stay in here another second. No! Thanks! A little. Good! What's goin' on here? [barely stifling laughter] It wasn't me. Um... it wasn't me. [regaining composure] It was not me. [sitting at Jim's desk] Hey Jim. I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet. Oh... It's ... [reluctantly] Yeah ... No, no, no! Seriously, I don't mind sharing. No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back. Are you moving back here? Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy. Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair. Oh my God, he is so cute! Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me? You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly. [phone rings, Phyllis reaches to answer] No. NO! [phone continues to ring] What's up? What? I don't know. Depends if you like a little junk in ... [notices camera] Umm... She's really cool. Yeah, totally. Did she say something? Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out? Can you find out? Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends. Go get yourself a monkey kidney." You just asked a girl out on the phone! It's a terrible idea. [talking to Jim] I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to b*at you up. Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam. No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right? You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home. So, we're cool, right? All right. Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation. No. Hey. How's it going down there? Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies. No. [laughs] Almost. Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great. Um... Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me. How did you know? Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons. Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway. What? You have something you want to say? Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices! Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name. What's this? What is this? Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose? The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and h*t some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. [Michael walks toward Sbarro.] Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome. And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like "Ryan, what's taking you so long?" And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say. So I said, "Ryan, what took you so long?" And I just said that to him, can you believe that? Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed. Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe. So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend. I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back, should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it. I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever. [to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or... It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together. Yeah, it would be so great if he was. Heading out? Have to think it through. Because if they say no... No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. [Michael starts playing with a football in the office] Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! [laughs] Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted. Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread? Do their pizzas play DVDs? Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so... Are you sad that Dwight b*at you? Oh. Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my... Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents? I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here. Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding? Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative. You should go to Hedonism. It's like Club Med, but everything is naked. [mimes lifting a glass] To Amsterdam. Umm... After my divorce. Yeah. Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me. Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates. Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager. Confidence, Dwight. I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone. Oh please! You're not taking any trip. You did? Yes. I am. Which is? You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point. Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini. I've got a time share in Key West that might be available. You really think you're going to go? Australia? I have always wanted to go there? That's awesome. Where are you staying? When are you leaving? Oh. Oh yeah. That's too bad. It's ok. I got it. I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel. Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys? I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one. From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. Yeah, but I've read it before. Definitely the Aquarium. Sure. Mmhmm! Yeah. Alright. All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga! [Sasha and Michael laugh] There is no way that hurt. Stop! Stop! Stop! [Ryan resumes the tape] Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow. He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone. Do you want to come over for dinner tonight? What're you doing? You never have plans. [singing] You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... [Dwight joins in] and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well... You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. [Jim and Dwight raise their hands] Alright. What's up? Thanks. They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion. Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, andhehad skin cancer too. When does he hear? ...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here? When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So...Thatwas the worst birthday I think I ever had. Sixty-nine cup of noodles. [whispering]No cookie. You use fabric softener? No, I do. [checking watch] We should probably head back. You dare me? How old are you? [over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner. Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls. Please, don't. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. No. [laughs] Who is that? Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it. Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go. Thanks, girl. I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't. I can't stop this investigation. It is my job. I volunteered for this job. It is my duty... Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where's my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest! No, it's marijuana. That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me. I would remember. That's not how it works. Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you. So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it. Is that supposed to be me? Hmmmpt.Pam/ Jinx! Buy me a coke. Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx. Sorry, that's not my problem. [placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim. Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar. He gives the coke back to Pam] Hey. Oh, God. 'Cause I'm in a band. We really rock. [crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes? What?! That is not true. Redact it. Redact it! I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby. Don't take her side. I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff. Yeah. I accept your decision! That doesn't make any sense. I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life. This is humongous. I am not a security thr*at... And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'. Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] "Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert." [flips to another paper] "Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to." [reading] "This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed m*rder. I think he may be the real m*rder." [flips to another paper] "Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can." Gah. "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone." [reading] "Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'." "By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier." The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful. It's a good market. Higher volume. I have a girlfriend... What? [looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date. What?! I'm the one who complained about you. [off camera] Okay, good. Check that out. [off camera] That's terrible. But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems. Okay, Jan will see you now. Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, "Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening." Makes you feel good. Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance. Oh, really? Mmm-hmm. How would you do that? [laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious? I don't believe you. Continue. [scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead. So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief. Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with A*DS. Who has A*DS? There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, A*DS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. "I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head." [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious A*DS joke. It's one of my dreams. Oh, nothing. They're wedding bands. Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now. There's a KISS cover band in here. I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work. Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too. I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza. Have three stages, yeah. Oh. Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums. On the drums! On the drums! We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band. Oh, my... No! No! No, come back! No, no, no! I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs. [coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks. Give me the dice! "Yeah, right," what? [Laughs] I have good cards. Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in. Straight. Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen. One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can. Smoke? Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here. Why did I hook up with Michael? It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer? Good. Have you told anyone? If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right? Bye! Hey. Good, especially after I took all your money in poker. About when you want to give me more of your money? Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight. What? What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that? Well, I um... I... I can't. You have no idea... ...what your friendship means to me. I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault. Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore. I got Jim's uh, old job. Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it willnotsay "Ryan Howard is a temp." It will say "Ryan Howard is a junior sales associate at a mid-range paper supply firm. ...that'll show 'em. Me too. ...I think we're just drunk. No... [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim--- No, I'm not gay. And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... [sighs] Uh... yeah I'm gay. I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable. Hey, Big Tuna! You're single right? She's pretty hot huh? [Jim nods] She's completely crazy. Steer clear Big Tuna. Head for open waters. OooOK. So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch. And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber. Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them. Definitely. Damn. [thinks] I'll try Brookstone. I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better f*re in Connecticut. Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet? Shut up. That's impossible. Well, I did it too. So what kind of commissions you get up there? Hey hey! Yeah. A sh*t of MIDORI, perhaps. Um, we should... All right. Business has been pretty crazy around the office. Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk. I will call him later with that message. Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left? Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically. Hey hey, fellers. Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me. D? I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know. People have been filtering in and out. What? Sure. You like Cosmos? Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy? I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just... I'm not better than Josh. Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her. Yeah. I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling. Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out. Evan, this is Jim. Do you guys work together? I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits. But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair. Why did you do that?! We're on the German team. sh**t the Brittish. Isn't that like your third soda today? It's the new guy. [looks at Jim] We just need a strategy, ok? We're going to set up a trap in the g*n room. All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44? [whispering] Look how cute he is! He's trying to sh**t with a smoke grenade. I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around. Just tap S then D. [her players g*n is pointed directly at Jim's player's head] Any... last words? No? What? [Karen's player sh**t Jim's player, "You k*lled Jim Halpert" appears on the screen, Karen giggles] Hug it out, b*tch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate. Okay, just get it done. Jim, will you make sure? [at vending machine] Dammit. Uh, nothing. They're just out of Herr's chips. But don't worry about it. My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority. That's perfect. Okay, great. I think that's enough. Can I get back to work now? I am NOT a quitter. I will do this all day if you want. Hey. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in. Oh, the vending machines! How did we miss that? Mm. [laughs] Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you? Yeah. I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal. [on phone] Bonjour. Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's. Non? Ah... merci quand meme. Au revoir. [spotting Herr's chips on her desk] Where'd you find them? Where'd I find what? [squeaky chair] Hey. My chair is squeaking. You took my chair. When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so... Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second. [rocks in squeaky chair] stop. This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please. This is not a proportionate response. [phone rings] Dunder Mifflin. Oh my God. Hi. Oh. I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day. Yeah, totally. So... Do you... Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here. A little different. What time is it there? Oh, yeah. Right. I don't know. It felt far. What? I type 90. It's true. 70? How many do you type? Come on. Tell me. You have to tell me now. No, it's, that's respectable. So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself... Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home... And, I'm freaking out. That movie is so scary! But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up. Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box. Would I make that up? Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet. I have one kitchen. It's actually... Three kitchens? [Ryan and Dwight enter] Hey, Ryan, are you ok? Yeah. Yeah. Um. Ok, bye. No, I was um... You have to go? No, I should probably go too. I mean, yeah. All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'. Sorry. Nice basket. We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I. Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane. From 'Cheers'. Got it. You guys ready to party? Hey, Big Tuna, you ready? One. Two. Three. sh*t! Oh, that burns! Golly. Um... One. Two. Three. sh*t! [sings] I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.Andy and Wait, wait.Andy and Oh, come on, guys. Please.Andy and It's not good.Andy and Goodnight, guys. No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin. Okay. Hey dummy, get in the car! Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car. Yeah, you can't. Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay? Hey. Who are you faxing so early in the morning? Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain. Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... [clicks her tongue to her mouth motions chopping off a head] Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing? [Karen nods and Andy looks at Jim] In your face! [surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut! But when I do, we'll have something to talk about. Sure, what's up? I honestly don't. I don't know. You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it. I'm gonna make some calls. So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford. And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch. Yeah. Michael. Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay. What you gonna do? You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job. Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would. Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay. Okay, yeah. Maybe I will. [to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out... [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott. So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines? Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you. This is going to be an adventure. ...which is why they need a passing game. [to Jim] No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man. Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not... so, your desk is... Oh my god! It's really you! I know. I don't care. It's really good to see you. You, too. Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford. Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me. What are you doing? I have a smudge on my forehead? Why are you looking at my forehead? Meet my eye line, Jim! Stop acting like an idiot! Hey, buddy. Welcome back. I'm good! How are you? So... Yeah. Um... unless you really, really want it back. Cool, thank you. Yuh. Congratulations. Hey, Jim! Oh, really good. How are you? Hey. Welcome back. [puts out fist to bump] No, I'm sorry, it's... No, it's nothing. We'll just... [shakes hand] So... okay. All right... sorry... sorry about that. It was just... Jim! Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you! Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing! Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please. But check that it's covered by your health care provider! [recording phone message] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message. [recording] This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message. [recording] [in bad Italian accent] Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza. Mm-hm. Hey. What happened to grape soda? Oh. You've changed so much. So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work? Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever. Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I... All right. Okay. Yeah. I know, me too. Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration? If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise. Shut it! That's... [whispers to camera] suck up! [off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy. Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink. Yeah. Ok. Hey! Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do. What's up? What do you mean? Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want. We're friends. We'll always be friends. It's good to have you back. Hey. ...Almost done? Just about... yup. Now. Good. All right. [everyone leaves] [over phone] I am so horny. Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack. Oh, and I care why? Next. How about... [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that. Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it? All... righty, let's get started. What is she into? I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates... Are you kidding? I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf. ...Danny Glover. [Jim raises hand] Yeah. Who? Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up? These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole. Yeah. I play the banjo. [singing] You know I can, my man. Hey. I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car. What is going on? I love it. I want in. Who's the target? Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment. Michael, please. [Michael makes kissing noises] Internet. And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office. I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom. And I nevah got caught, neither. Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room] Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen? Jim. What does it look like? And circle gets the square. He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease. OK... Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks. Well, that is probably from the test drive. This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. [singing] I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um, taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah. And a happy holiday to you. I don't understand? Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you. For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim] They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell. So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn't wrap it. Oh. Oh yeah. No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.] Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances. I didn't see where it was. Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth. OK, this is stupid. No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee. C'mon Jim, let's go. So she looks at me right, and she goes, "I'm sorry, don't I even know you?" After a year, ayearof buying lattes from her, do you believe that? Excuse me [tries to take away meat with chopsticks] Ah, un guard. [Fights with chopsticks and laughs] Family style. Jim! Jim! What... What's happening? Oh... Narcolepsy. Oh my gosh, now she's up. Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the Kn*fe below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers. OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. [Guys walk in with two different waitresses from Benihana's] [singing] And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know. No way. [both hold up Bridget Jones' Diary movie DVD] And now we get to remember it forever. That waitress was the one. How can you be sure? Don't make fun... You're making fun of me. I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm. I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike! Oh, why do I feel like crap? I had rebound? Yeah. Night. We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier. It costs seventy five dollars. Tape recorder. For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts. Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment. What? I'm not. I do not have a Kn*fe! [leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar! Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo? You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon. The Jamaicans don't have a word for "impossible." Mike, I'm very busy down here. [eats chicken] Already sent it to you my friend. Hey. You OK? You sure? Oh. You want to talk about it? OK, I accept it. Hmm. How far away does she live now, like ten minutes? No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah. Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan! No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe... Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot [playing conch shell] You sure? Hi, Jim. Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him. You know what? Get Pam. Pam, you look very hot today. Long time. Me lobe yoy long time. I would love to meet Long Tim. You ruined a funny joke, you. Get out of my offive. Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade? Yup. I'll trade. Let's go get a broom. Leave the keys. [Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting. No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten att*cks are from the rear. Oh... Thanks. [On Phone] One... Three... Seven... Sure. Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time. Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly. All right, I get it. We got a deal. I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent. My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys. Hey, do you want to grab a coffee? Yeah.[ Newpeat Quote ] No, thanks. I had some already. Oh, but, hey, Jim. I won an art contest today. Thanks. I sent in one of my watercolors. It was the new one I did. You ready Jim? Yeah. Thanks. So, let me ask you a question. Did you ever have a thing for Pam? I moved here from Connecticut... One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered. [to Ryan] Big Turkey. [cellphone plays "Rockin' Robin"] All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever. Thank you muchly. [cellphone continues playing] I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring. Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you. I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience. So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. [sings] Andy and the tuna... I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. [fake casts off] Whizzzzz. [catches Jim] Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. [Jim gets up] Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh! Hey. Yeah, you should not encourage him. Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't. 185 pounder. Check it out. Whew! ["displays" Jim who looks thoroughly annoyed] What? Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago. [singing] In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed. Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please. [after Jim knocks over his pencils] Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one. Nope. Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device? What's going on? Where is my FREAKING phone?! Maybe you're in the ceiling! We can talk about that. [Dwight high fives Michael] All right. I think we broke his brain. [they both snicker] Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much. [sighs] Do you still have feelings for her? Hello everyone! As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding. [Applause] So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did. And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one. This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever. It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta. I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever. Hey. Ugh. Everything okay? Well you seem a little tired. You should get more sleep. Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference. Oh yeah. Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping. Better than not. Okay. We are off. Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers. Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats. No, TATS. Of course I want- Leave me alone and get the male stripper. I knew you would, Nancy. No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette? [Pokes Ryan with a sex toy.] Gotcha, oh! [Phone rings.] Yes? I'm in the, I'm in the sex shop. Squarepants? And you think that'd be sexy? Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them. Especially that one. [Points to Phyllis] Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases. Hey. Oh, okay good. Well in the future please identify yourself as such. I do! I want some man meat! Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin? Pam. What do you think? In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment. Okay. [Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs] I... Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'. The Shrutes have their own traditions. We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair. Yeah. P and R? Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people? No way. I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear att*cks, they come when you least expect it. Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you! Hey! Oh... I'm pacing myself. No. I'm such a dorky dancer. I know. It's very cute. [to Pam] Hey, want to get out of here? You too. Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop! At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership. What? What's so wierd? [sighs] This is your job, Halpert. Oh, what happened? But Jim, this garlic bread is cold. Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted. What glare? Good night, Mary Beth! Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six. No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE! Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm. Jimbo, last chance to carpool. Sure? Might be a good idea. Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip. Play some games? I spy? Yeah. Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall? That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date. And it didn't end well. [tests smoke detector] Good. Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated. Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable. Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo. God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and sh**t some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes. Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me. I so got you. Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first. Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun. What's ah, what's with Jan and Michael? So do you want to see it or not? Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic. Yeah. Yeah! You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend. Later, Jim. Bye. Ok, so this is what's gonna happen. You're gonna suck it up. ...and we're gonna go to dinner. And then we're gonna go to the movies. Hey Halpert! I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened. Itsucked. I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars. Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded. Don't want it. Don't want it. Won't open it. Don't need it. Won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens. Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you. Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise. Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think... [mumbling softly] that maybe you should... [mumbling jibberish] What I'm saying is that, [continues to mumble jibberish] Ok, see what I did? By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position. Ok, let's try another one. Um... Walking out of the room unexpectedly. It's a surprise. Go ahead, ask me for a raise. [gets up and begins to walk out of the room] What? No, what did you say? Would you stop it, please? Sorry I almost got you k*lled. He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what was I thinking, right? Not anymore. It's, um... It's completely over now. Jim... I am really... sorry. A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks. It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that. When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and sh**t down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer? No. And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle? Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks. [as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out! What's this? Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department. "Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man. Dwight K. Schrute" Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look. There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap. Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees] Mornin' Jim. Good. Drew. Dr--- You can call me Drew. Cool. I can't control what you do. I can only control whatIdo. Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned. Ok, tell him that's not true. Ok, no. Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim! Tell him! Five bucks says it's over 50. How many? [in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful... On what? Really, ten? That's your guess? You're a professional accountant. Forty-two. Fifty-one. Ten... That is not fair. He has spent hours up here at reception with you.Hoursandhours. No, constantly. Like, foryears. What are the odds that this is in any way real? Dwight, you ignorant slut. And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof! [zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there. Oh... God. Oh my God, he's gonna jump. Yeah... Okay, uh... I don't see anything. She might be bluffing. That's a ridiculous question. Well that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought--- Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?! You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk] Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year! [on phone] Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations? Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions? Jim, big f*re in your house. Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids. No, no, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school. In person. [English accent] William Dolittle at your service. A.K.A., Will Do. I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology. The press wants a story, I will give them a story. Beer me! Hand me that water. I always say "Beer me." Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's-her-name? Who, Karen? Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends. [takes swig of water] Mmm. How's the apartment hangin'? Nice. Check out this sunshine, man. Global warming, right? Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet. Uh, yeah. Should have said so. [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah! Give me the b*at, boys, and free my soul. I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay. Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the b*at, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa-- Your call, dude. My girlfriend made an awesome mix. Beer me that disc. So, Tuna. When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay? Whoa! What the--- Why is my girlfriend here? No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef. The one in the green hoodie. I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something? She's like, probably a tutor. She probably a t-- Sh--- [shuts door on him] Great. Jamie! OH MY GOD! I had no idea. I'll be with you in a moment. Who was that guy she was talking to? At her locker. But whowasthat guy? The issue with the watermark is very serious. We teach our students that character counts. [scoffs] Pfft. You don't teach it well enough. One of your students is ab*tch. I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook. A full page, two words--- I feel terrible about Debbie Brown. She got fired because of Dwight. So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times. Why do bad things always happen to the good people? It's tragic. Just tragic. I don't care. Yeah. You know what--- I don't--- [Joins in with classic Andy falsetto] Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube! Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube! Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend? No. I'm good. Thanks. I'm Jim Halpert. [more horrible "Jim faces"] [to Pam] Hey. That is a demerit. You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law. [scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those. Three demerits and you'll receive a citation. Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior. That is correct. What's a dis... what's that? [jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move! What happened? What can I do to help? I'll check the web. [laughing softly] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it. Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force. No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation. You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a h*m*. Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom? You aren't curious? Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy. [quietly] Yeah. I'm going in. [marks Scranton with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what weknow. Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight? What's the occasion? Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up. Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um - [tires screeching] Crap. [phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute. Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy. Ugh. I'm hanging up. You have information about the sex predator? Where? We will be called Gryffindor. Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim. He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that. I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone] Hole? I am trying to bring team spirit. I can't say. [growly noises, Jim looks terrified] [to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight. Yeah. No. Good. Please just check. Hello? Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well. As well. Yes. uh, huh. That would be fine. [whispering] Cut it out! Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up. Ji.. why not? C'mon. You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager. Because I already did. Remember? I b*rned my foot on a George Foreman grill. Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got. You are being too modest. [Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey. What's different about you? You look worse. You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot. Turn around. Yes. Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut. What is it, Big Haircut? Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut. What? Hey. I think it looks great. Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit. Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it. [looks annoyed] No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger... Moon each other. All right. So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen? Pam is taller. Yes. She has bigger breasts, too. I think Karen has a prettier face. Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call. Yeah. Will do. [squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim. I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never. No. And the sheets are made of f*re. Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town. I'll have to talk to the manager. I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan! Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet. Oh my God. [mouths to Jim]Huge! [whispers] That's crazy! [moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God. Can you believe that? Wow! [to Jim] Good luck. [Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview. Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house. No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me. So we have all night. Where do you want to go first? How often do you come here? [Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work? So what's going to happen to us when I get this job? Well,ifyou get the job then I'd move here with you. Would you move with me? I'm not stupid. I was at the beach. We won't have a future in Scranton. There's one too many people there. Exactly. But you get it, right? Can't stay there. I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me. Thatis Beardy. Mm-hmm. Wow. That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction. Don't! She's nuts! [they laugh] Okay, good! Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch. And, I was gonna meet them, so... Just call me when you're done. Good luck, Halpert. I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan. Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim. You're clearly a very bright guy. Always h*t your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet--- Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers? And that, uh, questionnaire. Sorry to make you fill that thing out... ...that's a HR formality. We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like. [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads "Jim, Don't forget us when you're famous! Pam" It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall. Ugh. So, first up... How do you think you function here in New York? You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place? Okay. Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul. So... long haul. Where do you see yourself in ten years? Medium rare. Thanks. [they laugh] I know. I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job. I mean, why wouldn't he? He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK. We're friends. And I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just, we never got the timing right. You know? I sh*t him down, and then he did the same to me, and... But you know what? It's OK. I'm totally fine. Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in] Yes.
