Hey. Josh Porter, high five. [They high five] Bam. So what's going on? What I miss? Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves] Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said "You gotta f*re four people," and I was just like, "What?" Ya know? No, I just ignored her. She's the worse. Maybe because she's my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and... You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it, David [to Josh and shakes hands] Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous. Thanks very much. Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know? Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? [laughs] I graduated in four years. I never stud*ed once. I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, "Here Comes Treble." Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back? Hey, Josh, how ya doing? You're so immature! Ah. We all checked in? Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour. Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop. Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen? Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday. Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there! No one just called you. I'll see you soon. Michael, it's really not a competition. What's up? Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton. Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend. Not. It h*t the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing. Well, let's... Come on! Come on! Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill. [with her hands making the rocker sign] Call of Duty! Now? Put the game on hold everyone. See what I mean? Um, sn*per r*fle? WHAT? Are you playing for the other team?! Saboteur! [extricating herself] Okay. Um, sh**t. Uh, I will. Sorry. [coughing out his words] Suck up! Josh, did you hear what I said? My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight. Thanks. Hey, do you have a second? I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton? Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants? Hi. So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two. Awesome. Wha... excuse... why not? Today? You leveraged your new position with us into another offer? Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I... Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that. [after screaming and throwing papers around in the kitchen] What's up, Josh?
