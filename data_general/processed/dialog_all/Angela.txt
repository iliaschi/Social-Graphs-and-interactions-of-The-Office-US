[screams and jumps out from behind copier] Cut! Got it! Very authentic looking. Amazing. We needed a real reaction for the scene to work and we got it. Congratulations. [To Erin] You're amazing. [To Angela] You are so good! [screams] Still behind. I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right. Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye. Copy. Thank you. It's working. I'm doing it! What? Do you have your card? Who is he? [rest of Sweeney Todd cast enters and continues singing] And scene. Give me the punch card. That is not in the contract. Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape. Thank you. [whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy. Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss. Thank you. You, too. [steals a bottle of wine from the bar] Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model? [during curtain call for Sweeney Todd] Boo! Boo! All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good m*rder. All right, let's do this. It's okay, I smell. No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have sex. I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card] [nods to camera] Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is? Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up? Josh Duhamel. This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits. Oh. Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar. Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam? Angela as the nurse! The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever. Wow. We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people. Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all. Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small-[pointing to Angela] Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby! [reaching into her purse] Give me the baby! [to Cece] Hi. [to everyone] All right. Travel safe, Angela. [gasping as he looks into Angela's purse] Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby? [sighs] They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats. And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible. Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch. She loves me. [knocking on Angela's car window, Angela is naked inside] Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight! I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone. Yes! I have been so authorized. Okay. You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a- Drama Queen? 00. Come on in, enjoy! Roll in the hay, five dollars. Oh, our contract. Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil. I entered the sale, and I h*t enter, and I said, "dunh-duh-na-dah!" I'm pretty sure I timesed it right. What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap? Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose. [waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut] Uh, can we move this to the end of the day? Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing. Do you mind if we share this bale? There's no charge to sit on the hay, is there? I mean, wouldn't you think the ten dollars to build your own broom would include the hay and not just the instructions? I mean, I'm starting to think this guy is just trying to make money off the holiday. No, no, no, I wasn't--I was just laughing at your joke. Pay Place. That's humorous. So, if I were to call Dunder Mifflin and ask for Miss Angela Martin, would I get through to you? My wife passed away a few years ago. Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes. Oh my God, I can't look at roaches. We can move out. Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem? Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party. State senator. Who are you dating in the public arena? Oh, right. The state senator. Well... Cancel. We're canceling it. [Michael starts to throw away all of the food] No, we have to cancel the party. We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. [imitating Sean Connery] The name is Bond... Santa Bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow! [camera pans down to Angela pinning Michael's pants] Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa. Okay. Sure. You never know about the press. Could he help us with some parking tickets? Well, then he's not a senator. I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. [clip of Michael throwing Holly's Woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it] It is Christmas. And the game's over seconds later. It's nice. I know. [Angela hands Creed a pack of deodorant] For me? Thank you very much. Mmhmm. I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work. The real problem is the teachers' union. Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender? Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito. Annoying. Okay, so k*lling yourself. [laughs] I was just thinking about snot. Wow. Did your baby draw that? Angela. Who's the senator? Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'. Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman. I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it! Yeah, who wrote it? Aww, nuts. [laughs] Yes! The freaking PDA! Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them. Yes, yes, absolutely. I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because... [groans] As has Angela! As has Kevin! You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone. That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves p*ssy cats, and Packer loves- Easy no. Kind of embarassing. Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them. I did not. PB and J, my mom's recipe! [throws sandwitch at Phyllis] Mmhmm. [in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes? What's wrong with cupcakes? We thought. [walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?! Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point? Brava! Sure! Who's that? Who's that guy? [points to second guy in the pictures] I guess this could be the one, huh? [quickly] Erotic. I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop. Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said. He's good at his job. And I like working for him. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell. I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell. And I wrote my own companion piece to the "vag*na Monologues" called the "Penis Apologies." So I know a thing or two. Yes! I'm in. Someone want to sit in Kevin's lap? Angela? ...indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [Kevin finishes behind the rest of the group] Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time? I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms? Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day. Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office] Another one?Darryl and Yes! Could you turn the volume down on the beeping? Nine first. Thank you. Nice. Oh, I h*t three. I h*t three. How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system? Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met. [looks at ring, whispering] Wow... Yeah! Tell us a story. [laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person? That's not accurate. Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... [clips jumps ahead] Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though. I'll get over it. That was our dream wedding. [looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela. What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right? Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office. Wait, when did we start calling it that- Well, I am a few months ahead of you. Shhh, Pam. C'mon, don't be such a right-sider. [door opens, others enter] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch? Night. No, guys. He's fine. No he hasn't. No! She looks at it when she's on the potty, and she makes the faces. I flipped through it. Yeah. That sounds nice. Um, what should we talk about? Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help. Angela, that's pretty transparently me. You know it's just herbal tea. Yeah. I think you should call social services. You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we're in this together. Oh, thank you. Wait, wait. What's this? [holds up clipboard] It says "Lotto Pool", right on top. [points to obvious title] I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy. Nope. Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier. Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather. [giggling] Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather. I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress? I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert! Oh, I put those up. I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so... Oh. Yeah. I'm on it. Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made. Got it. Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty. Nuh uh. Andy. [alert sounds] 45. There's only 15 minutes left. [gags, coughs] Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is- Who's spotting who? Don't use the bike in the corner. That's Bruce's. Jeremy says... How can we do that? She's simply wonderful. Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist. Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute. I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply! Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order. [squeaks] Whoa. Yes! [they high five and jump in the pool] You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it. [Meredith sets f*re to paper ring boat] Got it, bimbo. [Oscar knocks at the door] Hi! You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby. I'm going to call him Little Kevin. Is he really five pounds? No, no, no, he's nine pounds, seven ounces. Well, if it's anything like that gorgeous wrapping paper, you h*t it out of the park. Again, it may not be the right size. I can return- stickle. Honestly, I can return this for a larger size. The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate. [giggles] Little Kevin. Angela. I knew that, I knew it. Chicken marsala. Mm-hmm. Yes I did. That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine. Oh, that's my cue to leave. Still. Still. Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me. Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding? You said that Robert was not fulfilling you- -and I said, "I bet I could fulfill you," and you said, "I'd like to see you try," and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls. And then I inserted my penis- Into your- vag*na and- Admit that there is a chance. Admit it. Admit it. Mmm. Before I go, may I? [laughing] Well, it's not exactly a vacation. What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago. Angela, you look amazing. Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too. When did you find time to do all this? Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good. Hey! Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch. Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us? Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby. Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course. No, three-month-old humans don't do that. Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again. Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no. We're good to goooo! Say- Eight Cases, bright white inkjet. That's messed up. [in voiceover] Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past. Hey, I was on the can. What's this about a black guy in the office? No. And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area. Look, I don't feel safe. I think we should call the police. It's interesting that you're drawn to the point of view of the attacker.  You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu. Okay. Good point... I was a twelve year old bully. Yeah, that's not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression. I don't know if this is gonna help...Uh... He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever. Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful. No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed. Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager. Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face? Phyllis! Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone] Listen to this. Or what if... We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean. No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst? Cheers. Angela! Dock Andy's pay one hundred dollars. Angela, two hundred dollars! No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis] What is this? I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help. That was really cool. [they make out] Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing. Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's? Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine. Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see. Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me. Oh. Oh, I'll tell you what he does. [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don't worry, I won't lay an egg. Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs] Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel? Hello, Erin. Hello, everybody. [laughs] Yeah. Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela. Sure. No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day. I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with. Oh, thank you. Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me- Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well? Oopsie, did somebody make a boopsie? Okay, shall we take a few more? Okay. There we go. Gosh, I hope so. Hi, Angela. I'm not supposed to say. Hello. They're testing it now. Seventy-two hours. Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand] Mr. Schrute, the results are in. You are not the father. In a way it's like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they'll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I'll have a grandson. Angela's cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can't eat cats. You can't eat cats, Kevin. I'll take him. I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle! No, I'm a dog person. You should ask him. It's a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy. Definitely no. Come here, I'll show you. I don't want it, really. I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night. Why are you getting rid of it? Your husband? You know what? I will take Comstock. I'll come by after work and pick him up. C'est la vie. American Diabetes Association. That's all right. What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie? [as he and Pam flip their cards] John Stamos. Uh-huh. [while Angela tries asking a question] What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie? Does Erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or... I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol' family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States. Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [mimics stabbing into Angela's throat] Six. [Pete opens air vent over Angela, papers go flying] Oh sorry! Sorry. It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest. At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare. Everybody! Hang on! [Dwight pulls out quickly] A jitterbug. [giggles] You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions? Not a question. Spring sing ‘95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had sex with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way. Nice to see you Oscar. Ouch! Right on target. Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome. What happened? Yeah, I think this day could get worse. Ok. [signs paper] thanks. I... did not. [laughing in Oscar's direction] Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! [Oscar makes sound trying to get him to shut up] I have to go to the bathroom! Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper? That's a tough one. Please, stop. Please, stop. Well, I am sorry Kevin. You know what Angela? I- Oh my god. [Senator enters] No. [to passing female pedestrian] Smile if you love men's prostates. Hi. More like fall cleaning. [chuckles] [dropping desk drawer] This doesn't... I'm sorry. Wha... what? I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela's husband spoon me back to bed. Oh, I'm sure ...that's nothing. Angela, Blake's also a guy's name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake? I just never heard about the senator and yoga... From you. I'm sure it's probably nothing. But what's with the yoga already? And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out. Little of this, little of that. Angela! [whispering] Angela. There. [whispering] On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her. She's repositioning his hips for downward facing dog. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... [whispering] I'm so sorry. I hate this. You're better. [stammering wildly] Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch. [scoffs] [whispering] Please. It's Robert who's enjoying it. Uh, what does -- what does that mean? I don't know, Angela. I'm dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go. He's making a phone call. Good morning. [clears throat] [whispering] Of course, ask me a que--  questions. [hoarsely] Yes, a little bit. [normal voice] Yes. It's the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I'm gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I'll just go downstairs. One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they're in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information's already on the computer, so....why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to "chillax," and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don't give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house.  Fight the power. Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you. Come on in, the water's fine. I know. That's not why I'm naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks] Oh, I'm sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I'm not in your panties, I don't go vigilantes. Why don't you ask your husband? [sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping? Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force. I can try. I'm gonna use SMS text. Text went through. All we can do is sit and wait. Huh? Get in the van. Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don't see them so I think we're good. I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out, I'm damn good at it. You tell me. It's the receipt for my g*n. And that's all off the books? Nice. No taxes. So what's the job? You can't have someone m*rder. What did they do to you, Angela? No! No! That's very effective. I've been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. It's devastating. No! You're not helping, Trevor! No. Angela! What are you saying? I'm trying, but what you're asking is-- I brought you a cookie. [chanting] "Pam!" The target-- it's Oscar, isn't it? He and the senator are gaying each other. Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you're engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils. Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger's knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend? I can't even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me. What do you mean? I am Oscar Martinez. Wha-- wh-- You hired someone to h*t me with a pipe! What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is... gay. He was gay when you married him! Angela, until you face that, you're gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won't stop you. h*t me. you have my blessing. h*t me. Angela, it's a lead freaking pipe. Aah! Yeah! You're not stupid. Jazz is stupid. I know. You're gonna be okay, Monkey. That is-- that is a loaded question. He said that? I-- I don't know if there's truth to-- to, uh, to that. Oh... uh... We heard it was called red-vining. Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone! So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us? Well, you are the one in charge of it. No. Done, right? We already said no. I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy? Yes! Phyllis! What does that even mean? Where would your name appear? [Reading from his phone] This is a real thing. "Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany." We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.[Kevin dressed up as Santa, helps Angela down from hanging lights] Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice! Stop that! Next! Lice. More lice. [Angela shrieks in disgust] Angela has lice. Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her. To be washed. No, all we need is mayonnaise. [walks in conference room] Shaboom! How do you like me now!? Take a picture. It will last longer. Oh! Uh, uh I'll go. Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up. [Angela is slapping mayo on Oscar's head] Angela. Now, don't worry, don't worry. I'm on my way to pick her up, but you might have lice too. You know, lice can be tricky. Sometimes lice, like...[Pam hangs up phone] Meredith, I am so sorry. [Angela rinsing Oscar's hair, and she bumps his head] Ow! You're waterboarding me! Alright everybody, who's in? [everyone except Angela puts their hand in the middle of the group, like a huddle] Angela? [Angela shakes her head] Don't make us come over there. Alright, let's go. [starts shuffling the whole group towards Angela] No way. Yes! [giggles and picks up Angela] One! [as he picks Angela up in the air] Two... [picks Angela up again] That's enough Kevin. That's enough! It's insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too! Well I can't stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me. I saw the leaves twitch! Yeah! [with horns honking] Kevin, can- "Higher than numbers go." The ceiling above accounting! Oh, no, Kevin, it's not a joke. Angela's husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind. No, let's-- let's-- let's not say Creed. Let's say Mr. X. Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't you cheat on Andy? Anyone want to see the video from Cece's recital? User error. I've heard of that happening to other people. Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point. And our training included picking carrots, scrubbing tubs, sewing imitation Levi's. A lot of telemarketing. I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together... [sees mural] Oh my god! [camera pans to mural with butts painted over it] Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts? [to warehouse crew] Huh? No way. No way! Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids. Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... [pulls cash from wallet] 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation... [undertone] Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too. He said he wanted me there for support. Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. [laughs] Me. [enters quickly] You need my pitchfork? What is it? I have vengeance to exact. Ah, I'm not interested. Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you? OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for coming. Phillip had no idea he was so popular. Hold on a second. Uh, Sandeep? Let's get you closer to the senator. Just about there. Great. And, Oscar? I'm gonna need you to step a little closer to the senator, as well. Somewhere there. He put me here. Yes. Sorry about that. Oh... [approaching Accounting] Hey, everybody, great job. [to Angela] Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks. All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela's desk] Who's that little fella? Uh-huh. [Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you. And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes. It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs. You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was "poisoned" by Aunt Shirley. Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was. Thank you. Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out- And there's parts of her I don't even recognize. There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap. It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know? It's a divet... ..where it was and it needs, it needs a... Oh, lookie here. It's big city Dwight. Careful you don't get mud on those fancy town shoes, big city Dwight. You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit. How would you like a mean cold slap? [slaps Angela] Ok. Yeah, trust me. Bye. Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down. It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose. Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off. Let's get to it. Give it a whirl. I need you to hose my aunt. OK you are useless. Give me the hose! Ahh! OK! Yes ma'am. Ow! The braid is too tight. Yes ma'am. Ok. And you look like one too. Thank you Angela. By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela? Would you like the stink sack? No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack. So, when's the wedding? Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you. Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse. Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey. I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you. Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine. Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart? I am. It was my rock bottom. Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right? Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. [after noticing Angela easting cupcake] Hey! [as others eat] Wait! [exits office, chewing] Oh my god. I forgive him so much. [Kevin begins making choking sounds] Whoa, is he choking? Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned? Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand. Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak. God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air. Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes. [Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction] Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots. Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper. Thank you. [Dwight kisses her forehead] Cool. Superhero. "Three PM Girl" Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it? Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified] Meredith! Hey. "You guys are k*lling it!" I mean, we're internet sensations guys! Ok everyone, turn off your mikes. Cheers. They caught us kissing on Halloween. Oh! Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy! Well, I don't like giving him bad news. You call him! Stop hitting me! Oh you? Hey, Hey Robert! Hey. Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos. Very much so. Absolutely. Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay. I think that's it! Done! Ok! Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I'll hold. I'm sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye. [hangs up phone] Don't worry. I've scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the camera together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on. [surprised chatter] They make a nice couple. Alright. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this. [holds up large check for $2,000] Whoa. Oh please. [Dwight watches Angela folding paper airplane] [cries] Come here, come here. Let's go. No. [clapping] Whoo! Come on Clark! You can do it baby! Yes! Toby and Angela. Well, Angela is the winner. After you. Alright. Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me. [To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely. [noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok? Wait, all of them? That's—that's awful, Angela. I'm so sorry. I've never met anyone like that. Angela, you still have your son. He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt. Thank you. Yeah, and Dwight, I'd like to be the first to say congratulations. Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood! Eleanor Roosevelt once said ‘the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.' [clip of him flipping off David Wallace] I think she's right. [clip of David Wallace yelling at Andy to get out] I feel calm now. [clip of Andy taking a dump on a car] I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I'm doing the right thing. Yeah. Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don't squash my knickety-knacks on top. Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too— But I just—it's in the past. And I feel like we shouldn't... Rehash— Exactly. Thanks, Angela. You too. [whispering] You okay? Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar. Wait a minute. You're not thinking of living in a— Okay, I'm just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent. Come stay with me. I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won't be long. It's the least I could do. Separate bathrooms. You're welcome. Let's go get Phillip. Then we'll get your stuff... And get you the hell outta that place. I know. And I can't do it. No, it's neat and tasteful, like most gay men's homes. The stereotype holds up. Angela, you just were— I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You—you can't— Angela, someone wants you. [as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on? Why? Andy. What's yours? Guys. Guys. Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says "bold front" instead of "cold front"? It's insane. Seriously, Kevin. I'm just gonna have to go to the store. I don't care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though. Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise] No, I don't need this! And you obviously don't need me. He just won't go down. It's as if he's excited by all this paper. Okay, I guess, it's just that Phillip got you something. I think there's, like, $7 left. That was a really cool move. What a chubbers. Whoa. I'm losing my balance. No horseplay. You wanna play with the cactus? Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer] Door. Chair. It's about Phillip. I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal. Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let's face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet. Very well. All right, Meredith. Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother's, and I'll meet you at Poor Richard's in an hour. She doesn't know I'm living with a straight woman. I don't want to get her hopes up. [in bullhorn] Pull over! Move to the side of the road! Pull over! What do you—Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over] [on bullhorn still] Shut up, woman! Listen to me! I love you! And I don't care that Phillip's not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you! This expresses how loudly I love you. [puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites. I love you! What? What? Why would you say that— [excited] Get out! I'm a dad! [whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding? [after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for? Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old g*ng gone. Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him. Where's my angel. No, this is my big sister Angela. [speaks in a special language] Whoo! Angela's special repairman is here. oh, wowee wow. Whoo-hoo...go, Meredith's stripper son. I don't know! I don't know. Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela] Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey. What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right? It's just the wind. Okay. [opens door] It's just the wind, see? Nothing. Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk] Let me help you us. Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high. Hey guys. What about the honeymoon? I still have my medal from that. [whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding? [after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for? Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old g*ng gone. Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him. Where's my angel. No, this is my big sister Angela. [speaks in a special language] Whoo! Angela's special repairman is here. oh, wowee wow. Whoo-hoo...go, Meredith's stripper son. I don't know! I don't know. Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela] Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey. What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right? It's just the wind. Okay. [opens door] It's just the wind, see? Nothing. Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk] Let me help you us. Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high. Hey guys. What about the honeymoon? I still have my medal from that. [to Angela] Are you coming? I can't, Sprinkles is sick. She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles. Can't your other cats keep her company. Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job. People keep calling me a "Wunderkind"; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word. Hey monkey, what's up? Sure. Check to see if she's faking. If a car h*t me, it wouldn't cr*ck my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp. So what do you need me to do? Mm-hmm. Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness. Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised. Hey monkey. Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead. Sparkles, the white one, is dead. That was the sick one, right? No. Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat. So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place. Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor. Sprinkles? Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan. She's only a cat. I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy. Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry] This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town. What's wrong? Hmm... Ah. Angela, I'm sorry. I'm more of a dog person. [Angela runs into Dwight] Oww! You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger. [sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression. How ya feeling, better? Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat. I am a farmer Angela. OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do. I... I sang her, her favorite songs. It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep. Well I'm not responsible for that! Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK. It's nothing, I'm robbing her. It's fine. What? I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how. I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good. Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela? Ok, look the memo is not about you... I don't see it. I think they both could do better. Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream. To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat]. It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed. And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises] You haven't buried her yet? Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He k*lled an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him. Hello. Really? I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side. Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles? Dry. Delicious. Oh, that's funny. Are you enjoying your mineral water? Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick. No, please don't do this, monkey. Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items. You're welcome. Yes... [whispers] I miss you. Elevators. Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends. Plus a little extra. Also, I love you. I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today. What's that, pipsqueak? You believe a computer can b*at me? Well I will prove you wrong. We'll see. Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party? So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch? I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful. Maybe you could just change the U into an A. Ohh, lunch party. Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway. I care! It's the European cut. Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper. I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone. Yes. Oh yeah, you'd better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Byyyyyye. I love you. [kissing noise, kissing noise] I love ya Pam... okay. [singing] I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be back. Tomorrow. Um... yeah. So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight? Huh?! Did you see the board? Hey. So. What do you think? I did it for you. You didn't have to. How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary? Hello. Um... uh... I'll get back to you. I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a k*ller party right here in Scranton. How we doing on time? Good. These are some things that I would like to have happen. Mmmhmm. Those are just things. This is how I want it to feel. I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important... Uh... I want it... I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, "Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?" Yes you can. You can pick one of these things. It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this. [b*lls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face] Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying? Hello. Listen up kid. [pops balloon with his hands] I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights. We're getting hungry out there. We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat. We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end. I think it looks good. Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice. It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor. Yes I will. If anyone out there is listening, I'm being held here against my will. I'm a minor. You said your upper back itched. Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you. I'll call you back. One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask. You took that with you. You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there. What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good. Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice? That's not happening. Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life? Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday? I do remember, yeah. You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party? We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time. OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right? Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it. [Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here. Aw. Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me. All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE. Not really a rhyme. Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator. Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me! [checking the oven] Uh, not even close. I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever. What is he doing here? Angela, would you like some of my beet salad? Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times. Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes. I am livid, Absolutely livid. Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying. Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift. Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's. [playing with Madlibs] Okay, adjective... Good one. Okay, you ready? [reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. "Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?" Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom] Say, we're gonna ditch this b*tch. You in? [tries to stop a sneeze] Ah-choo! Hold down the fort, I have to do something. [walks up to microphone] Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? [Airforce recruiter glares at Michael] Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they, well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin? We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe. First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party. Okay. If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have? Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga- Toga! So how much antigravity potion do you want? Hello Angela. Can I get a list of your vendors? Why would you do that? Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl's band plays soft music] Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring] Into the mic, sweetie. Can I be your bridesmaid? Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out] Ang. Ela. [sings] Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay-- Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding. This is where my parents decided not to get divorced. [exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint. Monkey. [kisses her] OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week. OK. No! You do not talk to him like that! Well, no. Dwight... Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C. Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No. Let's do this thing. [Dwight slaps her butt] Hey! Yes, all right. Who else? [to Angela] Can I put you down for 10 pounds? I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things. Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call. [Angela kisses him] Hey-oh! [sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray] Your wish is my command. Of course! Yeah! I mean it's a great song. I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway. You know? And you know what? The guys already know it so it's easy breezy. I didn't tell you. Here Comes Treble, class of '96 was available for our big day, so, I booked 'em. And, they are collectively my best man. And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out. Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker. But you know what? You're gonna love these guys. Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich. These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for. Nope. Mmm... Damnit, Phyllis! I'm sorry. [more softly] Damnit, Phyllis. It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments? That can't be right. Yo. I got the Nard-puppy for ya. What's going on here? Awww. Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby? Well - Why would that make me a pervert, I - That's not you. Whatta we got? Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth. And it was really, really quite amazing. She's with Angela. OK. Yeah. Look at my finger. Look. Looook! Look up here! What? Sorry. We're totally alone. The future mother of my children. You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind. Yeah? Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt] 14! 250. I need a hug, unless you're gonna give me one. So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful. Hobos live in trains. Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now. Done and done-er. Do you have a specific place in mind? You already said deal. Goodbye my petite fiancee. [chuckles] I will try. Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. [Oscar laughs] Shh... Why won't you do Andy? That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question. This is Andy Bernard! I wanna take you to sex school. Is somebody there? I have needs. Naked. The note. So "holier than thou". How could it be more clear? Okay. We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine. You're gonna need to be more specific. Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse. You wanna eat, don't you? Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture? Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard. Cats don't make butter. It doesn't make any sense. Okay, guys! Here's another place. [whistling Pachelbel's "Canon in D;" switches to singing then back to whistling] I'm Andy. Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, "I do." [Andy mouths, "I do" silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply... All right, get out. Get out. I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything. Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, "I do." And I said, "I do." And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness. Yes, of course it does. It does in the state of Pennsylvania. Haha, Mrs. Schrute. Wha... Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. [Angela walks over to Andy] What- Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme. Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay. Everything else goes in the drawer. I need you to get rid of the tree. [sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey... Ange... check it out. [sings] There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs] It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone. Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them. I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up sh*t glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore. Oh, sorry, it's your job. You never showed me mercy when you were in charge. Why aren't you wearing the hairnet? I need you to put the Christmas tree back up. I didn't ask you where it was. I told you where it needs to be. Excuse me? All right, everybody's still here. Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on. Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer. [sings] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA. Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo. [laughs] [coolly] Seems like you already know where. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away. [moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela's attention] You've got to tell Andy about us. Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore. Do you love me or not? Because you're engaged to Andy. [enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you. Is it true? That you're sleeping with Dwight. Is it true? Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight? How long has it been going on? Who else knows about it? Who else? What say we do. So like, missionary... Do you love him? Why should I believe that? Who says that? Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now. [shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out! Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it. [Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to "not hot" team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game. [disapprovingly] Kevin! [looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke] Does anyone smell anything smoky? Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options. Where do we go folks? Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth? A what? A rag. A damp rag, perhaps. Let's remember those procedures. What are the options? Okay, that's the wrong way. We've already tried that. Remember your exit points. Exit points people. What's next? Stay alive! I'm getting help! You're too heavy! Okay, I am not dying here. Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some f*re crackers and they start popping] Come on Stanley. You're losing you. You're losing you. Do it! This is you we're talking about. Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out Kn*fe from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go. Dwight! Are you okay? Oh my God! Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. [Creed looks around] So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best sh*t. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. [Angela jumps up] Ok... lower the mic for the midget. If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter] I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin] I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch. Angela, you're more chipper than usual. How much? Where'd you get that kind of money? Wait, you didn't give it back? Seven grand? I gotta see that little b*tch. You have your cats on Nanny-Cam? She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation. Any cat, you mean. [laughs] That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady! Awesome! No way. [pointing to staff members] Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! [holds up chainsaw, makes a wimpy chain saw noise] Cutting down the competition. [snickers] [sighs, touches Holly's sweater, cuts off sleeve, chuckles, sees Word document on Holly's computer named "Dear Michael," plugs in USB flash drive to copy file from computer] I was looking at pictures of food on my computer. Do you risk telling him how you feel? Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself? Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him! Yeah, Dwight and Andy. We were here. Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you? My god, he's like a black George Clooney. Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today. You still have that option. [Michael sighs] Should I seduce him? Excellent. What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way] Hey! Is that his scarf? No! [Kelly chases Angela through parking lot] Why would I do that? That's a lot. Come in... Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just... So you should be heading back to your desk. Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please! [on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings] Eh, uh, in a hotel. Jim, what do you say? I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh-- Are you kidding me? That is insultingly low. I don't even want to hear what your first offer was. If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now. Yes. Close your mouth, sweetie. You look like a trout. Can't you just not look at his feet? Fine. [pulls dress up, everyone gasps again] Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me. Thank you. Yeah. Respect the lei. Kevin, stay. Kevin, stay. Stay, stay. Cookie. Kevin, cookie. Mmm-hmm. Come on. I wanted a cookie. Oh, you know. Nohting. She's - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So... Hey, Angela! Welcome to - Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance? Oh. Alright. There you go. No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song. Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up! Would you like to dance? You weren't even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub! Yeah! Man in! It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin] [looks around room nervously] What? But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model. Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself. [interrupting] That Pam's pregnant. Unless there's ribs. [leaves] So rude, right? [sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day. It's incredible. Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people. Yes. That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you [someone growns in disgust], and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This-- Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us. Not according to the beans. Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended. Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned. You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding. Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time. [hugs Angela] If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come. I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit. I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while. [sighs] Nevermind. Yeah. That's funny. Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date] I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down she wouldn't be a good wife. Do you think they canceled the wedding? Anybody else? Who else has an idea? [Michael leaves to answer his phone] Can you hold down the fort? [on phone] Hey boo! [to Angela] Shhhh... [hangs up phone and walks back into conference room] Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now. Hey. This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim. It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't. It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish t*nk in the ground with no cover and no railing. No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in. Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!' Yeah. Kevin. I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut. See what? It's a k*ller new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office? Birthday lunch. Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch. It'll cure all of your "Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "I don't really see them together". So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine. Take with food. Michael, you have to put your hands down. Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother. It's not scary. Who are you? Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts. That could be a good sign. Now, Jim telling us all to work? I think that is a very good sign. Guys, listen. This was anonymous, all right? There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here. I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score. Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it. A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out. Second of all, there was no cash prize. Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim] [on microphone] Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of f*re where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley. [on microphone] I can't see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don't make me get up. [on microphone] That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet. That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus. I didn't say anything! Dwight! Jesus! Thank you. Good to meet you. But I banked six weeks. But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you. Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers. Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd. [with Angela in the break room] Bare my child. [naming race horses] Affirmed. Seattle Slew. Secretariat. Citation. as*ault. Count Fleet. Rollaway. w*r Admiral. Omaha. Gallant Fox... And... I know this. Uh... The jockey was Johnny Loftus. Sired by Star sh**t. Have a seat. Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract. It's been a long time since we've come down here separately. [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus. Agreed? Ebenezer. Jonas. Warf. Okay. Fine. Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male. Yes you can. It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months. [on the phone] Hey, what's up, kid? Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon? Very well. Two forms of ID, please. Nothing. Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending. Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion. Oh! Sorry! Sorry, sorry. [They retreat. Pan around office still full with staff.] Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself? Or is it? Are you gonna give me the leads or not? What are these for? Really? Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell. Gets to go home. [everyone starts to do push-ups] Ooh! I say 'dance,' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. [steps on Angela] Disqualified! Ok. Good. Hey, monkey, how you doing? Listen, can I talk to you for a second? Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore. It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family. No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook. Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later. Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me. I would be like-aaah! Sh-what? No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah! What are you- Angela... You're really putting me in an awkward position here. Angela, not here! Whack! [Isabel smacks Angela on forehead] Angela, this is inappropriate. Who cares? I mean it's not like I k*lled someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things. You want to talk to me, come to my desk. Oh. Take it up with the chief of police. I want to throw up just thinking about it. Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo. Yo soy Cancun. You have some ancestors in common... somewhere back. Stanley, please, this is serious! I don't follow this exactly. Uh, "The Descendants of any replicants from this union shall have..."Dwight and Are we talking about your grandchildren? No. Alleged contract. So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point "B", uh... the beet juice cleanse? How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample. Finally there's a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button. Look, I can't enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else. $30,000? There's gotta be another way. Look, I will not pay. But not in your bed. It's lumpy. Look, I can't legally watch this unfold. It's coming a little dangerously close to prostitution. No. Do you understand how rare is that in nature? Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse] God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound] Never mind. Just never mind. Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it! No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner. My name is Nick. Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either. You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing. Hey. You wanna go to the beach? You wanna get high? I think you do, mon. He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom. This is not good. What was that? What are you guys talking about? Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday. Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it. I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind. Yeah? How about green? So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious. Oh! Surprise. This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers? I think we could have done better than that. [to camera] Classic beginner's mistake, eating before a game. [Phyllis scores] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what's the score? Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly. You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet? Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality. What colors do you like? And the "Tight Ass" award goes to Angela. Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose. So...come on down. Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously? Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that? Sometimes we play "Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?" Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system. Are you sure you don't want to play? Come on Angela, don't you have a game? Well, let's play, what is it? We're friends. [alarm sounds] People! This is not a test! Move to the exits! Head towards the exits. Get up off your desks! No, panic is warranted! This is not at drill! Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively! Do you want to die? OUT!! STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim? Move to the exits! Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela. That's one book. You've got two others. Nice. Third book? Um, The DaVinci Code. Nice. Uh... Oh, I got it! Uh, what's the name of that, uh, tight ass, uh, Christian, uh, chick. The, uh, the blond? Dwight. Hey! You guys excited about the party? Yeah. All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such? Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good? Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers. Um. He sticks to his g*n. Yes? Yeah? Make him be quiet. No, I made brownies. ... What? I made brownies. [takes the gift certificate and tears it up] Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, I'm going to be at Poor Richard's. And the rest of you can go to hell! You were a Jet? Dwight? I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's g*ngb*ng this thing and go home. Good? Dwight. Good work, Stanley. Great performance review. Stanley in the house, everybody. Woo! Angela, your turn. Well, I heard they made outandhad sex. Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box. Yeah, is that hard for you? Alright, well- I'll work on that- Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately. Hey, Angela- How's it going? Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight? No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so. Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy. Where you rushin' off to? Yeah, well duh. Where ya headed? Liar! You are a liar. Angela, burger? Dog? Havin' fun? Chicken, hot dog, burger. There is soda inside. I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper? There's gotta be something else we can talk about. So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel. Yes, I got those cute little ones. [Angela looks at her disapprovingly] Do you think I should have gotten the big ones? [comes into the conference room in a Santa hat and beard] Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, [points to Ryan] pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting? No. Because it's better. Because it's more special. Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a sh*t. Angela, you're up. Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty. We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some? [singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning? Huh. Do you like candy? Cause you're sweeter than candy. What is wrong with you? [Dwight pats Angela on the rear and runs away laughing] Oh, now you feel some compassion for him. Why don't you go with him? Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes. They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar? That's unacceptable. No. Yeah, it's a business lunch. Angela who would you choose Jim or Roy? Hi, guys. I'm just walking around. I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that. No. Okay. Stop. Go on... Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be. Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this? Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck. Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten. Oh I did. I did. Oh, I bet you will before the day is over. [delivering plant to Oscar's desk] Oscar. What the hell is going on here? It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here. [song] You all ready for this? I've never, ever seen you take a sick day. I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter. Do you need any help? Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela? Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. [cracks up] One's good. Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom. It's going to be okay. Yes. Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good. Just the bread, it's fresh baked. Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake. Oh. I got it. [whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything. What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances? [whispering] But what if i'm hungry? Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day. I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently. Where were you yesterday after work? Angela, what about you? You're not onanything? We don't feel that way. No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup. I want him to have all the urine he needs. Oh, thanks! [holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style. Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation? [in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using "I" emotion language and no judging or "you" statements. No. Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution. Fine. Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code. Oh. Thanks. How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble "merely listen to and forgotten..." ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute? I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting. [off camera] You just press the button. Well, then, they need our money more than ever. Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he issohot. And he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring. I know he didn't do it. ...Maybe he did it. It's all on you, baby. Let's go. Yes. Thank you, Angela. I'm sorry? Well, it's probably just some accounting error. Well, it could be... Okay. I'm pretty sure Michael's involved because every other time there's been money missing from the office, it's always been Michael. Except, he's usually really obvious. Like, he'll say he spent $50 on a lunch with a client, and he'll submit a receipt from J. Crew. I went over my books three times. Has anyone in the office bought anything nice recently? Yes, it is. My grandfather left it to me when he d*ed. Hi, Phyllis. Um, we're going over everyone's expenses for the year. It's just standard procedure. Oh, my God. An emergency like, you have an ice cream cake, and you're in the sun, and it's melting? Okay.[ The Accountants, Webisode 03 - "Meredith" ] We're trying to find out who stole money from the company. Why don't we just ask her if she took the $3,000? You think I stole $3,000? Yeah. So, that's too early? I hope they bought something nice, and I hope you never catch them. I don't think it was him. Angela thinks it's an insult when she calls me a genius, all sarcastic and whatnot, but technically, guess what? I am a genius. When I was a kid, I took an IQ test and I scored over 100. So, joke is on you, Angela. But, my mom's in town, so I can't go. I really don't think it was anyone in the office. It had to have been someone. Maybe it was Roy. He's getting married. He can use the money. How do you know? You have a crush on Roy. You have a crush on Roy. Unbelievable. Does he excite you? Does he get your blood flowing? [Oscar growls] Does he get your... [Oscar growls] Wait, hold on. I'd never do something like that. It's wrong. I don't steal things. So, it isn't Phyllis, it isn't Stanley or Jim, it isn't Meredith, it isn't any of us. I didn't steal $3,000 from petty cash. I am not stupid. If I wanted to steal from this company, there are a lot of easier ways to do it. For example, I could seal people's coats and sell them on eBay. Okay, enough of this investigation stuff. We just have to put a memo to the office and ask that someone come forward anonymously. No, I wanna write it. No. Angela, you never let me write accounting memos. Yeah. [Oscar bumps into Kevin as they leave the conference room] God. Yeah, as in "justifiable homicide." Fine, then you write it. ANGELA STINKS. Kevin Malone, Accounting"] Angela stinks. I mean, I'm not handing it out or anything. And don't tell her I said it. It's just for me. In fact, forget that I said anything about it, ever. Oh, God. What have I done? [groans][ The Accountants, Webisode 07 - "Things Are Getting Tense" ] Wait. Here, I found it! Here it is! $2,800 returned to petty cash. Angela, I forgot to sign in the money. Oops. Um, I took that and then I briefly lost it, but then the Pistons b*at the Cavs, and so now I'm returning it all back. Go Pistons. But this is completely unrelated to the other $3,000. Yeah, but I won, didn't I? Oh, suspicious. Well, how come Angela suddenly has a new necklace, all of a sudden? What friend? What? That's not even close to being a real person. The guys who stole the money. He is still in there. What time is it now? It's slow. Well, you can't just tell me what time it is? Nothing. Nothing. I just want a new wok, there's a new one... It's okay. Shh, shh. This is so much fun. [in megaphone] Attention! There is a lot of junk in here! Over! You think he's gonna dust for fingerprints? What are we even looking for? Check this out. "Michael Scott is the proud owner of a quality Seyko timepiece." You think he paid $3,000 for a knock-off of a $40 watch? I'd lock it, too. That is very embarrassing. Okay, just go to Quicken, 'cause I setup online checking for him. Go to the beginning of the month. But what are you doing? I do not think you should do that. [in unison] Not it. You're saying Michael stole money from his own company? No! No, that's insane. It has to be somebody else. Like Meredith. Or Creed. No. Meredith, definitely. Which is exactly what you'd say if you did do it. Oh, man! I should've been handling this investigation from the beginning. There has to be a better explanation. He charged it. Discover. Made a little cash back on the deal. Smart. If he were a general in the Army, and you accused him without proof, you would be court-martialed in front of a f*ring squad. Okay, watch "A Few Good Men" and tell me that that's not true. I own it on DVD if you wanna come by later. "You can't handle the truth." Just kidding, you can. We, uh... We found it. In your books. You accidentally logged this equipment depreciation twice. Did you let someone else have access to your books? Then... Yeah. Oh. That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that. Yes I'm super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton. Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan. What are you doing?! Who should be the judges and juries of our society? Right there. Ah. Don't be mad, it is a business trip. Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager. Yes, Monkey. Don't "Monkey" me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M. There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train? That town smells like cheese steaks. Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out. Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard. Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who. No. [walking past Dwight's desk] Kitchen. That's not going to happen. Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms. Michael would never let me... I could never do that! Fine! Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired! You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that. Maybe I'll quit. Yes. I,will, make a difference here. Hey. If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice. You are not leaving. No! We are not done. Well, you can't get diseases from a bird! Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby k*lled this bird. And now we are going to honor it. An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he d*ed, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone. Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten. I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be? Oh my God, I'm so worried. I don't know. Dwight's so weird. No, he's a freak. Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going? Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think. Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that. Thank you, Kevin. Well, I find it beautiful. Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes? I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions... It's all vegetarian. It's hot in there. How's the naan? I am. You should come dance with us. Traitor. You are a traitor. It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. [holds up cards] A thousand business cards with this address and phone number. How about Cugino's? How 'bout Cooper's then? But, I don't want to go to DJ's. Hooters? Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe. Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver. Do you like it? Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way. Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional. Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know. [over phone] Mmhmm. When did the check come? Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move. Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby. Hmm. Andy. Okay. Angela? All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say "Boo" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like [puts on bandanna]. I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?! Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison? Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- [Dwight grabs bag with robe in it and walks away.] Why? I thought you said green was whorish. Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... [Phyllis and Pam nod their heads in agreement]. Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ... Yes. What? You're kidding. Hey. [Toby puts hand on Kevin's back, who is wearing the robe and feels it a little bit.] It'll be all right. There is now. We just started it. What's your funding? [pointing] Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun. That's a great idea. You can have your snack in here. Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... . I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer..[starts to leave office] for further regarding your paycheck! [runs outside] I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party. [with conviction] Start the party. Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.] Why would I be disappointed? I said you wouldn't be disappointed. [Meredith heads towards break room.] Is that a thr*at? I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela [puts out hands to weigh his options] Hmmm... I got goose bumps. [tries to break nut on a Nutcracker doll] These nuts are really hard to cr*ck. You've got to be kidding! My new girlfriend. Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room. I thought I could have it. All right [high fives Kevin] No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party] Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties. Yeah, but we don't have a power cord. [into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy? I totally rebounded. Someone else sh**t and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually sh**ting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o. [on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive... Too soon. [both turn back around and walk out] Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it. Yep, it's English, it's "impossible." OK. I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs. Angela. That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them? Are you sure? It is a big deal. Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river. Everything is fine. You are in the clear. Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder. Really? Ok. Sure. Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time. That's great. Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest. Oh. Oh? Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand. It's going to be ok. That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan. Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed. [sits at his desk] Hi, Angela. [lurking by the bathroom door] Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss. The one of all women? Because I'm gay? OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you. Can I join too? Nice to have Oscar back. Angela? Is everything okay? [trying to look in Phyllis's desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don't trust you, Phyllis! Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company. Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you? [imitating Andy] "It's not freakin' funny!" Yay. [scattered appalause] What's up spinsters? Okay. Co-ed naked strippers in this office. For realsies. What? I think that's champagne. Oh I love your poster. Hello, Angela. You look as beautiful as the Queen of England. Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. [generalized clapping and cheering] Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! Goooood bye. The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open. Thanks man. It was crazy. Well, I heard some shouting. And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. Jim says something. Roy stomps over there. All of the sudden, BAM. Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero. It was insane! Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared. Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry. And he's a big dude, you know? And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt. 30. Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what. I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car. [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that. So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels. Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter--- And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like "No!" Four. Really? Mm, good stuff. Oh, excuse me. It's my... favorite part. Midnight, Oscar!Don't worry, Kelly will be training you first. This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. Thisdayis bananas! B-A-N-A- I know, right? Probably a lot. [on phone] Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale. Ask where he's from. OK, great. Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry. And you're sorry. OK, ready? [thinks] Eleven. [laughs] Yes. [air high five] I expect you to apologize for that, Angela. Oh, but you still said "I'm sorry." Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map. OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher] I don't remember doing that. Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut. Ye - OK, yes. Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that. [tires screeching] Oh. Thanks, Michael. I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress. OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store. I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe. Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes! Sabotage. No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team. [Trying to wet bandana, falls in water] Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody! Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously! Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it! Are you going to try it? Being the boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. "Outside Hire." What? Yes, I... I have to buy another place. How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton? No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job. What if she makes me?
