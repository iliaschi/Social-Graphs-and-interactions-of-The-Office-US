Hey Cathy. How's it going? Everything make sense? Great. Oh no, I'm fine. Dwight! Oh, hey, I'll just be a second. Okay. Mm-hmm? [laughs] Told you. Oscar, Cathy has a question! Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held. [sticks a hand in the pool] Oh, it is warm. [to Cathy] Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret. Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight! Puppet. Man. Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, "Yes!" So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like? No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic. 'Talla-nasty', very clever. (takes out bag) 40. Always. Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy) No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you. Hey, how's it going? Uh... yeah, I'm just watching basketball. Okay. Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in... March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so... [sits on floor] In the bed. We gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed] Yeah. [jumps into bed] Cover me! Let the bedbugs bite! Okay, Dwight... Dwight... Dwight, Dwight Dwight!... uh... Euughh... Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present... Hey. Hmm? No. Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married. um... I mean- I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching. Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just... we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care. All right. Now I think it's time for you to go. [sprays the bed and Cathy] Stand back! [continues spraying the bed] It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart! Right there! [points to Cathy] [coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one! I think I saw it! Come on, man. Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers. Come on. I was in line before you. Yeah. Blogger. [to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.
