[sighs] [whispering] Why are you still here? [sighs] [whispering] Why are you still here? [bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day. Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex. It's very safe. It's very clean. Also, it's very accepting of all lifestyles. Let the games begin. [sings Olympic theme] Uh... Ten year. What? Wha? You said ten. Well, this is it. Um. Oh. [moves stove burner] Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off? A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people. The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't... ...know if you showed me this same unit or not. Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles. There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down. No, no, no. I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin. Alright. Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or... Oh, these... all your kids? Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay? Carol, you're on with Michael. Hi, Carol. How you doing? Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place. Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped. Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night. Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink. Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you...[phone rings] What do you... Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just... Right. Yeah? What? Okay. Problem. Good. Good, All right. Sounds great. Bye. Hey, hey. Hey, Carol. You look great. Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters. It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds. What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about? No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss. Does anyone want a drink? Cosmopolitan, please. Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been... Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport. Four! [Holds dice in front of Carol] Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. [Holds dice in front of Jan] All right, here we go! Nice to meet you. Yeah. Good night. She's a good boss. Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you. [points at woman] What does that look like to you? Oh, yuck. [spits out food] No. These s'mores are disgusting. Oh. Awww! What do you say? I didn't hear you. [laughs] No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic... Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much. Yes. Ok. Okay. Good night. [louder] Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra. [Carol walks through door looking upset] [waves] Carol. There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello [kisses Carol] You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde. [laughs] Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side. Turn around, turn around. Come on. [making a body turning gesture] Thank you. Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. [puts finger on her back and reaches for her butt] Berp. That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings. I know. Right. Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart... And next to your kids. What? It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word? No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in [making drum noise] Jamaica's largest fresh water pool. I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. [Carol shakes head in disappointment]. You better find the skimpiest bikini there is. And it's all inclusive. Yes. No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.
