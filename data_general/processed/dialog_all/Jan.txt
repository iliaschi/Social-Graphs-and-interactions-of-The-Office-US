It didn't come up organically. [to a client] ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. [Seeing Michael and Dwight] Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. [to client again] The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to... It's nice to see you doing so well. Bringing home the bacon. I don't understand the reference. We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him] He hasn't changed. Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was? What? It's normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's. Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin! Because we work together. Am I the princess? Mommy! It was cool. What did I learn? He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me? [walking into the Funky Cat] Bingo. He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him. [pulls out a recording device from his pocket and clicks it on] Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.[scene from Dinner Party, Season 4 and The Job Season 3] Forget everything we taught you. Hey, Jan! It's so great to see you. What? Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead. Oh, my God. Um, I talked to his assistant. And I guess it did get a little confusing ‘cause you said not to tell anyone your name. And then also, those bluetooths are very hard to hear with. I know you love the way they look, but Tom never had us use them... I'm so sorry Jan. Listening. Sorry. So this was all just a trick. You don't really have any business to give? But not to us. What? Yeah. Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid? [chuckles] Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever. And it is so cute how she signs her name. Oh, okay. It's just that's how Cece does it with the backwards ‘E's. Oh, actually she can. Of course. Um... "A"... "X"? I don't -- you got me. Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water? You're the Quizno's. [chuckles] Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn't quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name? Hmm? He's been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young. Very good. Don't you dare! Andy! Hey, Jan. Nard dog here. I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup. Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to. [whispers] Coolio. No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood. It, it's, it's actually just an issue... Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but... [naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach? Creed Bratton, 75 plus division. 82 November first. How much is the prize money? Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here? What? Look, no it was not... Darn it. No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity! I would prefer a public place. See you after work. Hi. In his office. You can go right in. Jan. So elephant in the room, I have your old job. Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities. Well... you look great. Scranton suits you. You were let go. Hey. [holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles? I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids. Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people. Well... What is that... word? So older people have just as many rights as younger people? Why don't you wanna go tonight? What... all your friends are gonna be there. It'll be fun. Just... Yeah. Thank you. Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser. Do I have your permission to invite Carol? So this one goes with my eyes and this one goes with your eyes. People have said I have very pretty eyes. I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine. We already have a sofa. So why do--- It... folds up. You've only seen it flat. I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost? No--- don't... that doesn't even mean anything. [on the phone] Michael, it's Ryan for you. We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration? Oh! Um, actually, I need the car. Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin'? Okay. How's yoga? Wh-Why not? Okay. So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt. Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying? Jan. Michael left. I don't know. I don't think so. Jan, he went running that way. [singing] Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back. Hey Jan. Not much, what's up with you? I'm out of answers Jan. I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you. I don't know that. I'll stay off the grid. Yeah it is, it is. I really messed up. That's really nice of you to say. Don't sell your implants please. That's nice though. [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that says "Good Morning"] Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back. Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? [Pam pushes a button the phone] Hi buddy. Yeah, I hate that. So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs. Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy. Well- Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor. Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win. Million dollars! Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized. Perfect crime. Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good. I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up. Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves. Oh. Very good. Well put. Uh, wh-why would she say that? Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, are you sure? How can you give up my diary like that? How'd you even find it? I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this. Fine. I love you. How can you do that to me? You can respond, just remember it's all going into the record. Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it. [Driving with Jan in the car] What do you want to do for dinner? Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap. Do you fast food? Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying] Hi. Come on in. Good to see you. We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine] It's really nice. Okay. Totally your call babe. Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door. Well, thats... Yep, never been used. No. So you have an office and a workspace? It's f*re. Bond. James Bond f*re. I am Bond f*re, James Bond f*re. Michael Scarn. [clicks tongue] Just like that. Just like that. Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color. Well, I- It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. [Lies down] No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry. Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool. If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away. Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see. Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies. I'll get it. Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers] Except for one flower, which is for... my flower. What am I supposed to do with this? Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it. 00? When in Rome. Whatever you say babe. What was that? Yeah that sounds good. You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him. [playing charades] No it's a... hump. There's a hump. Montana. All right, [rhythim clapping] my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn. What, no, I'm just making people laugh. Yes, I was watching Jim's face. And he was laughing. All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom- No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger. You're welcome. I don't like that story babe. Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible. Is there more wine in the kitchen? I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip. So you keep a very tidy house. No, yeah. What? Oh, are you joking? I've noticed how you look at him at the office. I'm sorry. [doorbell rings] What now? Hello. [whispering] Awesome. You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person. Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see? When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children. Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? [Jan walks away] Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg. I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover? You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that? Everybody enjoying their meal? Yeah? No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together. [to the guests] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good. BFD. I'm a screenwriter. NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS! MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES! OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER! You know you don't have to press charges, you could just try to be more quiet. Alright. [leads Michael away] Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? [Holly freezes; Michael laughs] No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back. It was great to see you, Jan. O-kay. Hello Jan. Yeah, Michael, I just uh... Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you! [Jan laughs] Are you nauseous? Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you? Good. Good. Thank God. Cause that's... Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy... Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very... ... proud. Um... You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to? Well, okay... So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so... You did? When we were going out? W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms. You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm? IHop. IHop. If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a sh*t at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count. I'm glad you told me. Um, I'll... I have to think about it. Hi, can I help you? Hi Jan. How's the candle game? Cool. Thank God they found her, too. Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet? [Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan. What do we have here? So this is Astird. Oh, OK. Why didn't you call me? I could have helped. Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways. No, I don't! Can I hold her? Assst... ...trid Levinson. Hi! Astrid, this is everybody, look. This is your family. You're going to know them for the rest of your life. [looking at Creed] Well, he may not be here. Say hello! OK, here we go. [lifting the car seat high above his head] Lion King! All right, how about some presents? I want to see some presents. [holding a memo pad] I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes. Oh! Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole b*mb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator] I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync. You know, that's all. Oh, great. I washed my lipstick. So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth. You gave birth in a tub? Um, so you're in the tub with everything? Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach. Me too. I could have helped. [smiling] Uh, yeah. No. I can imagine. Oh, I think she's on a sales call. Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed] No, she's just on a coffee break. Yeah, that's a good one. We're taking a picture. She's nature's bounty. You don't flash around a newborn baby. Don't you know that? [sees Holly behind Jan] I was just going to... I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt. Sure you can't stay a little longer? All right. All right, everybody, we're leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving. Oh. I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk. Ah. Thanks, Dwight. OK? Wha - that's, I hate her. Wha - God! Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine. All right. Back to work. Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. [walking out of his office] Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah. Um... Me no get an agenda. I didn't get any agenda. Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes. Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you. OK... No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent. All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding! OK. No problem. Question. How long do we have to... [Telephone rings] Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it? Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person. The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist. I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works. I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan. Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good. You gotta cr*ck these things open. Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice. Well, it's a su1c1de mission, you know. There, there... [scoffs] When have you ever done that? Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes? Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould. Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to f*re Jim Halpert. Dwight Schrute. Well... He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office. That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan. Yeah. Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I f*re Jim? Affirmative. You just said, let me uh... check my notes. You just said... Hey, hey how is Alan? Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates! Uh, huh. Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize? Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to... [talking to the speakerphone] Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton? Well, you could take the bus. You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home. Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So... [to camera] Could you...? You're dropping an A-b*mb on me here. Well, yeah, I mean, what is... No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party... ...it happens once every billion years. Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay. When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering dr*gs from one guy to another. The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything. Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan. THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! [laughing] Come on. You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first. It's... That's... Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny. This guy does it all. What? [to Ryan] I'll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk] Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today. So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County. Our whole county. And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years. [groan] Years. I changed it. To Chili's. Radisson just gives out this vibe, "Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson". It's kind of snooty. So. Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course. It's where business happens. Small Businessman Magazine. It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor. Uh huh, uh huh. [under his breath] Power trip. Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan. [under his breath] Kiss ass. Ok, probably going to go late tonight. Burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you could all just take off now. Well... No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here. [Jan stares at Michael] That's not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare] Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao. [to Oscar] Adios! Uh, I'll drive. It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you? At all! You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de- Dar de dar. We should come up with a signal of some sort. Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal- Well, I... it could be either of us. Thought that was you. Hi. Michael Scott. This is Jan Levinson-Gould. No Gould? Uh, Jan, what happened? Is Gould dead? What uh- Wow, you're kidding me! Do you wanna talk about? When did this happen? This way, please. [mouths "Wow" to the camera] Awesome blossom. Ok, it's done. Actually, [turns around] Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome? Now it's done. I heard a- Very very funny joke the other day. Wanna hear it? Ok. Ohhh no! [laughs] Oh my God, that's funny! I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose! [making the mouth on his tie talk] Yum! Yum yum yum! [Christian laughs] That's delicious! I love it! Well, we are out to save money. Did somebody say "baby back ribs"? Hmmm? Hmmmmm? Woo, well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or Dare? Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh. She's not playing the game. Check please. You didn't. It, you know what, it really is. [waving to Christian] See ya. We did it! Nailed it. Nailed it! Come here. What!? Interesting. Jan is calling me. Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. [puts Jan on speakerphone] Yeah? Jan! To what do I owe this pleasure? Well, hello to you, too. Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's. Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's. Oh. Been thinking about you. Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just- Yep. No. [pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon. Hi, Jan. How are you? Good to see you. Ok. [tries to kiss Jan's hand] Ok, why don't we just step into my office? We're gonna go in here. Alright [takes Jan's coat]. It's nice to see you. Really? Oh, well. Alright. Yep. I'm a little confused. 'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy. And then it's like all regret. Because "Oh, I regret that." But, "Wait, I'm still gonna call you." But, but, "We're just gonna talk business. And I may come down and f*re you if you don't do your job." But what were talking about when we first kissed? Business. No, no, no, I finished all of that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am. But I do say thank ya ma'am. But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam. Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam. If it's consensual. [cold Jan stare] We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question? This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise. Are you wearing a new perfume today? Well, you're wearing it at the office. And [smells Jan] it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy. I did not, not, not use those words. Everyone's waiting in the conference room. "we need better outreach for employees fighting depression". Ok, alright, enough with the jokes. Nobody in here is suffering from depression. "Don't sleep with your boss"? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan? I don't understand why you're so upset. Let me ask you- Ok, let me ask you this. Let me ask you something. I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened. I'm sorry, am I interrupting? Oh God; were you guys making out? Ok, great. Your performance has been adequate. You may leave; goodbye. I have a copy of your key. That is a serious offense. Very serious. As is toying with a man's heart. Jan, have you ever had deer? What do you say, Jan? Ok. You just, uh, clear your head. [Dwight opens door] Thank you, Dwight. Yeah, no, I don't think you can. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why? Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place? Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance? I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio? Am I too short? Really? I appreciate that, thank you. No, I wasn't, I didn't cry- So my looks have nothing to do with it? Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times. [knocks] Hey, what's going on? Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say. Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads... No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby. But I just... just want to keep it within reason. They did this up in Albany... And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so... Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like... [stands up] Anybody want any coffee or... Women in the workplace... yeah, translation "I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls." Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh! Jan. Michael's still at the door. Michael! That's what I'm talking about! Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing. Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable? We could do it in the warehouse. Remember on Lost when they met the Others? Mmmhmm. [points at math equasion on chalkboard] Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little "Good Will Hunting" situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind. Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations. I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that... In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober. I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan. [general murmuring of agreement] Oh, me too. Thanks. Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off... Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um... OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it. I'm excited about today. [whispers] I love girl talk. Michael, Michael, Michael, Mi... [knocks] This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points... Don't get hysterical. Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons? Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you. But we're bonding down there! I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear. Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through... We have a history... ...between us. This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs. Slip. What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal? I mean that's a baseball term, right? [in the background] ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you. Are you married? That must have been hard. You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael. At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God. Hi. Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially... I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some... Cool. Cool. OK. Nice to meet you. Ditto. [to Jan] How are you Jan? OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to... And that about does it, thank you. Yeah. Here's the deal. I did not understand this was supposed to be a full on... like report or whatnot. That is correct, yes. Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know. Oh, ok. Alright. No you're not. Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So... Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David. I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again. Night Phyllis. Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again. Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. [Jan turns and then kisses Michael. Michael looks and sees camera, Jan turns and sees camera, too. Elevator door closes.] Oh, great, put her through. Hey, you. It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday. Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday. Thanks. [grins] I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing. Top 80 percent! Yeah? Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam! Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here. I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez. Oh, come on. Come on. You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break. It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael. Hey, Jan. How you doing? I am? Oh, okay. A*DS. Okay, sounds great. Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning. [Sees Jan] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Jan. Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship. After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong. Hi, hi. No, I'm good. Thank you very much. It was fun. Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive. Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess. Well, I'm having a nice time. Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson? Super 8? Motel 6? Best Western? All right. No, thanks. You having fun? Yeah, we all really... Well, I think you look great. Yeah, why did you? Oh, yeah. No. Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship. Hey, okay. Thank you. Okay. Thanks for coming. You, too. Okay. Talk to you Monday. 30[ The Accountants, Webisode 01 - "The Books Don't Balance" ] Well, we've been trying to balance the books for a week now, and for some reason, they're not balancing. There's about $3,000 missing, and we're trying to figure out where it went. It is not an accounting error. This is the first I've heard of it. They never tell me anything. I like it that way. Absolutely, Jan. OK. Who put my calculator in Jello? Good one. But uh, seriously, guys who did this? Seriously guys, who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND! I watch the L Word. I watch, q*eer as F***, so... What? What does that even... I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about? I don't kn-- Anything's possible. [laughs] Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody! And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm going to look for a place for you at Stamford. Hey, Jan. Yes. Okay. Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules. The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention. Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow. No, that was a different hundred dollar bill. I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening. The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited. Sorry, my meeting ran late. Yes! Ha! Ok. Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play. So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year... I don't approve. I don't. [Jan walks in on Movie Monday] Hi Jan! Hope you brought the Milk Duds! People work faster after... No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie. [outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH! GAH! [breathing heavily] Is this Jan? This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter. It's about Michael. [exhales] I can't talk here. It's too sensitive. No, but we should discuss that another time. Pull over at exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop, until I can meet you. Many of your blouses are Claiborne's. Part of my job. Did you get anything good? I can save the branch. If you let me run it. [excitedly] "Ok" I can run it? Mostly get rid of waste. Which is half the people there. And clean house. [to waitress in diner] Right here. It's all for me. Thank you. [shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way. There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings. [thinks for a second] Where is it? Hi. Oh. That's nice. ...what? ...you were at the dentist? [sighs] All right. Oookay. Let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan? Or does somebody miss me? I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here. You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want is a day off. [thoughtfully] A statue. Yeah. Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him. Mm, no. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us. Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan. Mm hm. Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck. But Ed truck can't because he is--- Damn it! Uhhh... nothing. Yeah, nothing. How was your day? Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that? Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base. Hi. Oh, I don't know if I'm... There she is - Jan Levinson. First... ...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan. [singing] Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby. Yes. I don't understand. On whom's authority? What? You're welcome. Am I a small number person or a severance package person? Oh... [burrys head in hands] Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up. Well... Oh, you gotta be... Josh? What does that mean? Jan, hey. Okay, this is it. [runs up the stairs of CFO's house, with Dwight] This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like "Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person." It's very dramatic. Although, I can't say I was a big fan of 'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else. Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely. Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry... I'm gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job. As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples. [nods] [sighs] I'm sorry, all right? It's done, it's done. [frightened] Uh! Wow. Thank you. No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um... No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think. [takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie] He's not here. I don't know where he is. We know the branch is closing; Michael told us. Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something? Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton? Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton? See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. [answers phone] Jell-o! Hi, Jan! I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted. Yes. But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two. What? Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting. Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means. I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted r*pist. [Jan sighs] ... I'm just kidding. Last week. Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal? Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now. Yeah! I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh? Hi Jan, you look... tan. Yeah. How was it? OK, yup. I... I... I... Yes. OK, yeah. Who is Dr. Perry? I... And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well. So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh... Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate - [Jan leans over and kisses Michael passionately] Jan, you... complete... me. No thank you. I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin. I am 99% sure. Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will. I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand. No, today at work. So you don't want to end our relationship? That is so sweet. You are the best GD girlfriend in the world. Do you know that? Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? [phone rings] Heh-woh you. Hey, Buttercup. I am on my way. I should be there in about 15... That's what she said. Uh, yes you are. Hello, Jan. No problem. [doesn't turn off speakerphone] Ok. Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I... Ummm... I don't know. Maybe. What are you looking for? You bring dip? Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too. Over our love. You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all. I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star. It's a heart. I love this woman! Jan, glad you could make it. Of course I do. Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great? I could go for an appeteaser. Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. [takes sip, coughs violently] This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out. You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas. Crazy. Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it? What are you doing? Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy. What has gotten into you? No, no, no. Come on, let's go back to the party. Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan. No, no, no, means please don't. Please. I'm not going to slam you up against the wall. You're acting inappropriate. Jan. Hey Jan. Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle... You didn't have any of the potato salad did you? Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly. I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces. I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling. Whatever. That's all, you didn't mean it? I love you, Jan. No need for consternation, everything is under control. It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled. I'm... here, Jan. Well, we fired Roy, obviously. And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company. No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage. Yeppers. I don't... remember. You're useless. No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today. Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away. Yes, I'm bringing Darryl. Mm-hm. Hey, I'd rather k*ll myself. [talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible. Toby is the worst human being I've ever known. Thanks, Kev. I'm good though. Who's the boy toy? Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek? Hi, Jan. Pippity poppity. Six percent? After all we've been through? I got you... jade earrings. No! Why don't you just take that pen and s*ab me in the heart. This is me, Jan. This is me! Okay, no, no, no, no. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere. Sure. Great. Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I--- Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make--- Ah, so... All right, Levinson. Here's the rub. I would like a 15% raise. Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win win win. But you know, life is about more... than just salaries. It's about perks. Like having sex with Jan-- In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me. Huh? I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls - Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable. I... uh, well, I don't know. [leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later. Thank you. Abso-fruit-ly. No... No... Yeah. Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] "... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -" [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] "who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy." He's from that company in Pitts... Why... are you here? I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you. Why privately? Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of. So, how you been? Good. Yeah. Thanks. [looks suspicious] Hmm. Sound good. Sounds fun. Hmm.. Would you excuse me for a second? I find it offensive. Au natural, baby. That's how I like 'em. Swing low, sweet chariots. Yeah. First got priorities. [holding Jan's breasts] Remarkable. Wait, wait. Check one more time. Very good [Jan nods] Yes, indeed. He would be disaster. Hey. Pretty good. Could have gone better I guess. Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later. Daaah, let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would... be fine. We'd have fun. I can't tell you. Tell me what? Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview--- Frankly, it's overdue. Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic. Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work! You smoke constantly in your office. You spend most of the day online shopping. You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days. Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale. You go to Scranton far more often than you used to--- Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan--- It's not. It's not. Hey!You'reunstable! No--- We're all unstable. [laughs] Totally! Bye. Oh, thank--- [phone rings, picks up] Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace. Sure. I know. I know, I'm sorry about that. That was terrible. Well, it's... [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK. [whispers] I don't know. [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
