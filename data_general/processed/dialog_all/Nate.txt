I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada. Hola, tu es une buena worker? Y el accento, donde are you from? You speak English? Ok, good. Me too, get in the car. When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted? Yeah, go away. [Kelly nodding] Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy. Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert. Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight. [answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up. Show him how to use it. Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that. There's no building. This could only mean one thing. She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...Dwight & Yeah? Oh. Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon. What? Well thanks. I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper. Okay. Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go. I'm freezing. I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go. Eh, cool. We'll figure that out. I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that. He didn't die, his brain d*ed. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it? Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt? Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid. Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up. I've been married thrice and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce, I'm not sure I'm the best person to give love advice....I was hoping you were gonna make me feel better. Uh huh. Como esta? [speaks Spanish] No. Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish] Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head. Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here. Yeah. Hey. No, no, no. Maybe just later. Wow. Those are really nice. Cashmere. Can't wait. [Sighs and grunts] Orientation is over. Hey what's up? You called? It's cool really. "This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster att*ck" Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package. Myâ€”my mom. Okay. It's all right. It's all right. You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum. [interrupting] Tell us who defaced the mural! There's no gum. There never was any gum.
