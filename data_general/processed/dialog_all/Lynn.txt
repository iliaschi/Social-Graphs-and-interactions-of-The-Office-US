Babe alert! [to the redhead] Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig. Hello. At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies. It's really cool. Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more. I get very nervous talking to pretty girls. Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is. Are you on email? Cool. Bye. No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand] Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking. I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
