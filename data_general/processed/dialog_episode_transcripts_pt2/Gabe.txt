Okay. [starts round of applause] You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok? Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So... We have a little song prepared for you. Wow. Really terrific. No. Don't like that. Talk about vacation days! Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff? Mm, nope. Don't like that. We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right? They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day. I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us. Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em. All of them. So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups? The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing. Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now. Wait a minute, who is it? Who's there? Is there somebody in the room with you? [Michael gesturing "no"] I want to see who it is. Turn me around. [Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello! I like that. Good-looking group. Another couple of heartbreakers. Who is this tall drink of sun tea? [gesturing to Michael] I thought this guy was the manager? Yeah. Take Jim's old office. How late do we have to work tonight? Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is? We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael! Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for m*rder someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around k*lling people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone. They act like I have no power. Thank you. Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that. Exactly that. Exactly that. [again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level... Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice. I'm not crying. [on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth] The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure. Yeah. Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. "Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall." "Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies." Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave] [imitating Cookie Monster] "Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful." I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work. Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making. Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek] [Gabe walks in] Thanks Toby. [gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize. [gets on one knee] I kneel before you. Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition. I didn't see that movie. Do they still get paid? Pathetic. What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression? [imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person. "Ciao" Right? "Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee." Okay, I have more of them. What is this? How do I apply? Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going? Come here. Come here. Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking? Kelly is disqualified! You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America. Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic. Kelly is the only applicant. Hello. Sometimes my bangs cover it. You don't know what you need. Just... Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette. Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right. Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important. Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on f*re. What are we gonna do about this? [calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay. Whatever. I'm the one blending in. Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe. Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag. So embarrassing. We will be well-rested tomorrow. Excellent. Go for it. What? I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you. It wasn't me. What? Based on what? Hey guys, uh, sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone. Through Teach for America, I'm going to go down to Detroit and teach, uh, inner city kids about computers.
