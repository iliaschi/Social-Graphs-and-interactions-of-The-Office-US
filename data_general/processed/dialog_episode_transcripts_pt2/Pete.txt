Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it. Right! That would be hilarious! We should totally dog her, about being an artist, never making any money! Like she basically has a hobby, for a job. So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring? The other thing would "get" Jim. Good to see you. So Pam, how much does an artist make after they leave art school? Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal? Love that one. Here you go again! What is your deal today? Half. Also good. Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit? We pranked you! ... Got you. That's a very good record. That's when I'll do the face, like- A noogie? Pam, you've got the greatest smile and you're body is really fine. Hoping it'll make our wives take it up a notch. Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming. Oh, wow. That sounds hilarious. I do actually. [pulls whoopee cushion out of pocket and hands it to them] There you go. Use it in good health.Tom and
