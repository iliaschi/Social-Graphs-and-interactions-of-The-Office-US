[to Angela] Are you coming? I can't, Sprinkles is sick. She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles. Can't your other cats keep her company. Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job. People keep calling me a "Wunderkind"; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word. Hey monkey, what's up? Sure. Check to see if she's faking. If a car h*t me, it wouldn't cr*ck my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp. So what do you need me to do? Mm-hmm. Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness. Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised. Hey monkey. Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead. Sparkles, the white one, is dead. That was the sick one, right? No. Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat. So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place. Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor. Sprinkles? Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan. She's only a cat. I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy. Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry] This is Sprinkles. [holds up a picture] She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, [picture of Angela holding Sprinkles] just a couple of kittens [starts to cry] out on the town. What's wrong? Hmm... Ah. Angela, I'm sorry. I'm more of a dog person. [Angela runs into Dwight] Oww! You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger. [sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression. How ya feeling, better? Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat. I am a farmer Angela. OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do. I... I sang her, her favorite songs. It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep. Well I'm not responsible for that! Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK. It's nothing, I'm robbing her. It's fine. What? I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how. I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good. Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela? Ok, look the memo is not about you... I don't see it. I think they both could do better. Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream. To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat]. It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed. And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises] You haven't buried her yet? Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He k*lled an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him. Hello. Really? I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side. Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles? Dry. Delicious. Oh, that's funny. Are you enjoying your mineral water? Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick. No, please don't do this, monkey. Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items. You're welcome. Yes... [whispers] I miss you. Elevators. Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends. Plus a little extra. Also, I love you. I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today. What's that, pipsqueak? You believe a computer can b*at me? Well I will prove you wrong. We'll see. Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party? So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch? I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful. Maybe you could just change the U into an A. Ohh, lunch party. Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway. I care! It's the European cut. Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper. I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone. Yes. Oh yeah, you'd better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Byyyyyye. I love you. [kissing noise, kissing noise] I love ya Pam... okay. [singing] I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be back. Tomorrow. Um... yeah. So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight? Huh?! Did you see the board? Hey. So. What do you think? I did it for you. You didn't have to. How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary? Hello. Um... uh... I'll get back to you. I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a k*ller party right here in Scranton. How we doing on time? Good. These are some things that I would like to have happen. Mmmhmm. Those are just things. This is how I want it to feel. I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important... Uh... I want it... I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, "Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?" Yes you can. You can pick one of these things. It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this. [b*lls up post-its and throws them in Angela's face] Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying? Hello. Listen up kid. [pops balloon with his hands] I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights. We're getting hungry out there. We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat. We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end. I think it looks good. Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice. It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor. Yes I will. If anyone out there is listening, I'm being held here against my will. I'm a minor. You said your upper back itched. Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you. I'll call you back. One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask. You took that with you. You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there. What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good. Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice? That's not happening. Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life? Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday? I do remember, yeah. You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party? We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time. OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right? Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it. [Andy and Angela enter] So glad you're finally able to be here. Aw. Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me. All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE. Not really a rhyme. Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator. Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me! [checking the oven] Uh, not even close. I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever. What is he doing here? Angela, would you like some of my beet salad? Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times. Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes. I am livid, Absolutely livid. Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying. Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift. Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's. [playing with Madlibs] Okay, adjective... Good one. Okay, you ready? [reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. "Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?" Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom] Say, we're gonna ditch this b*tch. You in? [tries to stop a sneeze] Ah-choo! Hold down the fort, I have to do something. [walks up to microphone] Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? [Airforce recruiter glares at Michael] Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they, well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin? We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe. First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party. Okay. If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have? Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga- Toga! So how much antigravity potion do you want? Hello Angela. Can I get a list of your vendors? Why would you do that? Oh look, they're starting. [all watch fireworks display; scattered applause and cheers; Darryl's band plays soft music] Angela, will you do me the honor... of giving me your tiny hand in marriage? [shows her a ring] Into the mic, sweetie. Can I be your bridesmaid? Party planning's a real high. Like a runner's high. [gets out of elevator; hears moans and heavy breathing coming from office; opens door and sees Dwight and Angela making out] Ang. Ela. [sings] Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay-- Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding. This is where my parents decided not to get divorced. [exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint. Monkey. [kisses her] OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week. OK. No! You do not talk to him like that! Well, no. Dwight... Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C. Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No. Let's do this thing. [Dwight slaps her butt] Hey! Yes, all right. Who else? [to Angela] Can I put you down for 10 pounds? I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things. Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call. [Angela kisses him] Hey-oh! [sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray] Your wish is my command. Of course! Yeah! I mean it's a great song. I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway. You know? And you know what? The guys already know it so it's easy breezy. I didn't tell you. Here Comes Treble, class of '96 was available for our big day, so, I booked 'em. And, they are collectively my best man. And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out. Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker. But you know what? You're gonna love these guys. Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich. These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for. Nope. Mmm... Damnit, Phyllis! I'm sorry. [more softly] Damnit, Phyllis. It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments? That can't be right. Yo. I got the Nard-puppy for ya. What's going on here? Awww. Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby? Well - Why would that make me a pervert, I - That's not you. Whatta we got? Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth. And it was really, really quite amazing. She's with Angela. OK. Yeah. Look at my finger. Look. Looook! Look up here! What? Sorry. We're totally alone. The future mother of my children. You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind. Yeah? Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt] 14! 250. I need a hug, unless you're gonna give me one. So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful. Hobos live in trains. Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now. Done and done-er. Do you have a specific place in mind? You already said deal. Goodbye my petite fiancee. [chuckles] I will try. Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. [Oscar laughs] Shh... Why won't you do Andy? That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question. This is Andy Bernard! I wanna take you to sex school. Is somebody there? I have needs. Naked. The note. So "holier than thou". How could it be more clear? Okay. We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine. You're gonna need to be more specific. Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse. You wanna eat, don't you? Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture? Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard. Cats don't make butter. It doesn't make any sense. Okay, guys! Here's another place. [whistling Pachelbel's "Canon in D;" switches to singing then back to whistling] I'm Andy. Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, "I do." [Andy mouths, "I do" silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply... All right, get out. Get out. I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything. Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, "I do." And I said, "I do." And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness. Yes, of course it does. It does in the state of Pennsylvania. Haha, Mrs. Schrute. Wha... Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. [Angela walks over to Andy] What- Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme. Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay. Everything else goes in the drawer. I need you to get rid of the tree. [sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey... Ange... check it out. [sings] There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs] It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone. Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them. I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. [holds up sh*t glass] I don't think they're appropriate anymore. Oh, sorry, it's your job. You never showed me mercy when you were in charge. Why aren't you wearing the hairnet? I need you to put the Christmas tree back up. I didn't ask you where it was. I told you where it needs to be. Excuse me? All right, everybody's still here. Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on. Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer. [sings] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA. Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo. [laughs] [coolly] Seems like you already know where. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away. [moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela's attention] You've got to tell Andy about us. Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore. Do you love me or not? Because you're engaged to Andy. [enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you. Is it true? That you're sleeping with Dwight. Is it true? Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight? How long has it been going on? Who else knows about it? Who else? What say we do. So like, missionary... Do you love him? Why should I believe that? Who says that? Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now. [shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out! Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it. [Kevin sits down, gets right back up and heads back to "not hot" team] No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game. [disapprovingly] Kevin! [looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke] Does anyone smell anything smoky? Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options. Where do we go folks? Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth? A what? A rag. A damp rag, perhaps. Let's remember those procedures. What are the options? Okay, that's the wrong way. We've already tried that. Remember your exit points. Exit points people. What's next? Stay alive! I'm getting help! You're too heavy! Okay, I am not dying here. Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some f*re crackers and they start popping] Come on Stanley. You're losing you. You're losing you. Do it! This is you we're talking about. Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out Kn*fe from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go. Dwight! Are you okay? Oh my God! Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. [Creed looks around] So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best sh*t. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. [Angela jumps up] Ok... lower the mic for the midget. If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter] I normally don't enjoy making people laugh. [grin] I didn't eat lunch. [Oscar gives Kevin a look] I didn't eat all my lunch. Angela, you're more chipper than usual. How much? Where'd you get that kind of money? Wait, you didn't give it back? Seven grand? I gotta see that little b*tch. You have your cats on Nanny-Cam? She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation. Any cat, you mean. [laughs] That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady! Awesome! No way. [pointing to staff members] Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! [holds up chainsaw, makes a wimpy chain saw noise] Cutting down the competition. [snickers] [sighs, touches Holly's sweater, cuts off sleeve, chuckles, sees Word document on Holly's computer named "Dear Michael," plugs in USB flash drive to copy file from computer] I was looking at pictures of food on my computer. Do you risk telling him how you feel? Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself? Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him! Yeah, Dwight and Andy. We were here. Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you? My god, he's like a black George Clooney. Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today. You still have that option. [Michael sighs] Should I seduce him? Excellent. What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way] Hey! Is that his scarf? No! [Kelly chases Angela through parking lot] Why would I do that? That's a lot. Come in... Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just... So you should be heading back to your desk. Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please! [on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings] Eh, uh, in a hotel. Jim, what do you say? I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh-- Are you kidding me? That is insultingly low. I don't even want to hear what your first offer was. If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now. Yes. Close your mouth, sweetie. You look like a trout. Can't you just not look at his feet? Fine. [pulls dress up, everyone gasps again] Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me. Thank you. Yeah. Respect the lei. Kevin, stay. Kevin, stay. Stay, stay. Cookie. Kevin, cookie. Mmm-hmm. Come on. I wanted a cookie. Oh, you know. Nohting. She's - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So... Hey, Angela! Welcome to - Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance? Oh. Alright. There you go. No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song. Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up! Would you like to dance? You weren't even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub! Yeah! Man in! It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin] [looks around room nervously] What? But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model. Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself. [interrupting] That Pam's pregnant. Unless there's ribs. [leaves] So rude, right? [sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day. It's incredible. Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people. Yes. That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you [someone growns in disgust], and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This-- Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us. Not according to the beans. Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended. Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned. You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding. Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time. [hugs Angela] If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come. I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit. I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while. [sighs] Nevermind. Yeah. That's funny. Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it. [glares at Stanley's date] I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down she wouldn't be a good wife. Do you think they canceled the wedding? Anybody else? Who else has an idea? [Michael leaves to answer his phone] Can you hold down the fort? [on phone] Hey boo! [to Angela] Shhhh... [hangs up phone and walks back into conference room] Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now. Hey. This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. [Kevin chops into Erin, who is dressed as Princess Fiona] Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim. It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't. It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish t*nk in the ground with no cover and no railing. No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in. Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!' Yeah. Kevin. I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut. See what? It's a k*ller new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office? Birthday lunch. Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch. It'll cure all of your "Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "I don't really see them together". So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine. Take with food. Michael, you have to put your hands down. Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother. It's not scary. Who are you? Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts. That could be a good sign. Now, Jim telling us all to work? I think that is a very good sign. Guys, listen. This was anonymous, all right? There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here. I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score. Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it. A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out. Second of all, there was no cash prize. Look who it is! [shows camera the cake, which has a picture of Jim] [on microphone] Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of f*re where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley. [on microphone] I can't see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don't make me get up. [on microphone] That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet. That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus. I didn't say anything! Dwight! Jesus! Thank you. Good to meet you. But I banked six weeks. But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you. Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers. Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd. [with Angela in the break room] Bare my child. [naming race horses] Affirmed. Seattle Slew. Secretariat. Citation. as*ault. Count Fleet. Rollaway. w*r Admiral. Omaha. Gallant Fox... And... I know this. Uh... The jockey was Johnny Loftus. Sired by Star sh**t. Have a seat. Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract. It's been a long time since we've come down here separately. [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus. Agreed? Ebenezer. Jonas. Warf. Okay. Fine. Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male. Yes you can. It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months. [on the phone] Hey, what's up, kid? Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon? Very well. Two forms of ID, please. Nothing. Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending. Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion. Oh! Sorry! Sorry, sorry. [They retreat. Pan around office still full with staff.] Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself? Or is it? Are you gonna give me the leads or not? What are these for? Really? Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell. Gets to go home. [everyone starts to do push-ups] Ooh! I say 'dance,' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. [steps on Angela] Disqualified! Ok. Good. Hey, monkey, how you doing? Listen, can I talk to you for a second? Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore. It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family. No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook. Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later. Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me. I would be like-aaah! Sh-what? No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah! What are you- Angela... You're really putting me in an awkward position here. Angela, not here! Whack! [Isabel smacks Angela on forehead] Angela, this is inappropriate. Who cares? I mean it's not like I k*lled someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things. You want to talk to me, come to my desk. Oh. Take it up with the chief of police. I want to throw up just thinking about it. Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo. Yo soy Cancun. You have some ancestors in common... somewhere back. Stanley, please, this is serious! I don't follow this exactly. Uh, "The Descendants of any replicants from this union shall have..."Dwight and Are we talking about your grandchildren? No. Alleged contract. So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point "B", uh... the beet juice cleanse? How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample. Finally there's a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button. Look, I can't enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else. $30,000? There's gotta be another way. Look, I will not pay. But not in your bed. It's lumpy. Look, I can't legally watch this unfold. It's coming a little dangerously close to prostitution. No. Do you understand how rare is that in nature? Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse] God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound] Never mind. Just never mind. Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it! No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner. My name is Nick. Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.
