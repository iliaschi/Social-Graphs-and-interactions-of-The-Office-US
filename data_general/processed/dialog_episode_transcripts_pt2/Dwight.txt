What? Did you see who did it? One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then. Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a m*rder or something. It was an accident. No. Hey D. Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine. I have to visit the alchy. I wouldn't put it past her. I wrote it out. Hey. Any problems? What!? Sprinkles. Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time. Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking? [sobbing] Alright. Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish. You never... you don't like them. Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you? Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects. OK, 1 Sikh, and... As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical. Excellent. Um... I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor, but... Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head. I can help you with that. Oh God, Rabies? I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD? This place is so cursed. It is going really great. Shut up. Oh, really? Yep. Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips. You got it? Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing. That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock. Back off me. No. The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab. What does that mean? You did k*ll her!? You put her in my freezer. Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out. You! [hits Dwight] It's OK. It's nothing. How could you do that without telling me? Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized. [runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit. [turns to address Jim and Pam] No way. No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest. What do you want? Oh, what is that? Her name was Sprinkles. I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground. Don't rush me. I'm grieving. I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight? This is company-wide, Dwight. We have a date! Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight? Yes. [puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in] Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you. You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit] Very much. How's your meat? I heard a joke today. Yes, it was. I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body. I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could. Smell that. Do you smell that? Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food. Thank you. Is that all? Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that? Good. Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door] No, this is my quest. We don't need luck. But thank you, that was really nice of you to say. [looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater. It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I h*t Meredith. I know. So who's next? Proceed to the highlighted route, then route guidence will begin. Who? We're with Office Depot now. Well... OK. I don't think we're coming back. OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch. [driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are? That is true. Yes, she is nuts. It looks delicious? I don't know. Then we're not coming back. No he's right. Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us. Proceed straight. I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing. Make a right turn. No, it said right, it said take a right. Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. [turns right] The machine knows where it is going! The machine knows--- stop yelling at me! No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake] Let go, let go of me! [watching car get pulled from lake] You sure you're OK? Good, that is what's most important. What a disaster, this whole thing. These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it. What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us. Hang up. [Dwight hangs up] You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket! We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand! Oh what is this? Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! [sits on couch] Look, my clothes are so wet! WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY? I ate them OK, I ate the turtles, they're gone! 00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company. Wow! Watch out Dwight. Actually it sounds like you are. Yes, please let us know. Waste of time. The website's going to win. I don't care, but yes. I don't care, and you won't. And this is where I will record your sales. I can't tell if he's mocking me. Thank you. Or a gong. Twenty seconds to go time. Really? Power gel? Okay. We start. As soon as I make... this sh*t. Aaannnddd go! What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working? [blowing air horn] Yeah! What kind of prank are you thinking? [on monitor] What is a Jim? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the first... girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with. Tie goes to the girlfriend. How's it going? Yeah? You look a little worried. Kelly ordered this online. But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, "Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin." Who knows? Hey! How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk. Start sellin' multiple reams like a man. Mmmmm. I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them. What did I intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them. If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow. [on monitor] Oh. I didn't realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples. I'm sorry. Am, so sorry. I... yes. Uh, could you repeat that? No ! [blows air horn and dances] Stop it! Gimme that! Give it! Four! Three! Two! One! Woo! After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams. Fifty-two reams! Dwight has defeated the computer. I didn't ask you to do it for me. What do you think of Angela? No, not like that, as a woman. W-O-M-A-N. You hadn't noticed she's a woman? I hear she's single and ready to mingle. I'm thinking about making a play for her. What do you think? Crazy, right? Isn't that part of the fun? She works here too, how is that any different? Fine. What kind of business is this? You're such a loser. A loser. Alright stop, stop making him say it! You just made this worse, a whole lot worse. Okay. Why are you looking at her like that? How did you, um, where did you... So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested. But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down. I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I can hear you, man. Hey, hey, hey stop it. Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no. I kidnapped a kid. I could have paid for the pizza. [to Dwight] Mmm-kay. I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent. I will open the door. And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands. Yes. [pizza guy flips him off] Okay. Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens. What a horrible day. Bluh. Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today. And you know what? I'm going to get it. Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi. New York. Wanna go? Alright, you drive. Okay. Here we go. Mmm. See you later. [mocking Ryan] I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face. I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot. I made it with my cheese pita. I started a f*re, I started a f*re. And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody... Wanna head back? [talking on phone] Sure, I can hold. Hey Dwight. Do you run the bed and breakfest? It is not a B and B. Does the Department of Health know about this? Hello, I'm looking for a room. It says here you cater to the eldery. Trip Advsior. Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see. Two? Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her. What about my cherub figurine? No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp. Fine. No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars! What are the themes? Nice. Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story. Not even Harry Potter? But you promised. Mose, bags! Now! You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less. Well, I hope this conversation has helped. [Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn. Hey Dwight. Oh yes. Ever since the storm. Yeah, yeah. Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here. Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you? You okay? Dwight, how's the hotel business? Have you checked Trip Advisor recently? Maybe you should. The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm. Dwight. Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton? Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam. Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you. I think the engineer left. You playing that game again? Oh it has losers. I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking. Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base? We'll use code names. That's not different enough. Has anyone ever come up to you and said, "You're not creative"? Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night. No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, "Oh D, oh D." Yeah. D for Andy. Oh D. This is perfect. This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone. But, you will not tell anyone. What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch. We're like Animal House. What are we doing? What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing? We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.Michael and [chanting] Utica! Utica! Utica!Michael and No, I'm not calling Karen. What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight! Are you kidding me? Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so... Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink b*mb. No, no, not real b*mb. No, no absolutely we are not doing this. What is that? Dwight, are you peeing? Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight! Michael, watch the road! Pull over, pull over! I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening. You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place. No, no, you won't do that. Nope. Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please? Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go. [from the walkie-talkie] We are in a stairwell. [from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs. Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me. There's a guy, there's a guy. Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close. No, no, don't do anything to them. I have to do something to his eyes. Aha! [crashing] We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! Jim leave us. Save yourself! Dwight, could you move over a little bit. Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back! You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so... Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted? I'm taking Stanley. OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a Kn*fe. OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. [Dwight comes back with set of knives] Hey, what... Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight. That'd be great. This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial k*ller. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead. Well, yes I would. And I would survive. Well... You... You... you are as creepy as a real serial k*ller. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK. I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing? No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to h*t Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it. [smiles] Hmm. Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out. [leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow] Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature? Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes] What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just -- Stop. Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight. Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug] [to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A Kn*fe, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really b*ating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with Kn*fe] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't h*t my corroded artery here... I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. [screams] Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter. Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious. Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day. Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those [points camera to mushrooms] are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. [puts them in mouth] Don't patronize me. [Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell? I told you. [walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing ping-pong] How's it going? I'll make the call. Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad! [on phone] This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it! [hangs up] Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday. Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate. Hey-o! Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler] What are you doing here? I hate my life. So can we come in? [crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table] It's actually really good. And now you guys are dating? I'm gonna get going. Sir, do you have any other place you can stay? Maybe with one of your friends here? Flooded. No. Nope. Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear "Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la." No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired. Well put it aside. [hangs up the phone] [Dwight enters] Umm... yeah. Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model... That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go. [on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed. She's dead? [Dwight makes Kn*fe slitting noise] She's so young. Oh, God. Oh... Try not to be so hurtful Jim. I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... [sighs] You're right. What do you mean though? Hmm. [looking at the chair model's headstone] How did she die? God. She was so innocent. You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do? Oh, you move on. [singing] Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off [with Dwight] and die?Michael/ Return. This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it. Smells good. Oh don't. That's disgusting. Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice. I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions. Dwight. Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators. Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls. I'm right here. I am going to go get laid. Goodbye. Place is packed. Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall. Hey, how ya doing? Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard. Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries. Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms? Insane. Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean? Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna h*t the bathroom. Yeah. I don't know, maybe. With vodka, you're the best. [to bouncer] Check again, Ryan Howard. Yeah? Wooo! Let's bail. [starts to leave] We're not going unless we can all go. There you go. It's for you. From them. [points to Jersey State girls across the bar] What are you doing man? [to Dwight] You have to go with me. Stay. Stay, please? Call me. This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment] This is it. This is where the magic happens. One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have... Dwight, I'm the boss. Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on. Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone. No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do? Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK? I... love it!! Haha, come on! Greatness is only skin deep, some people say... Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside... And in this case... That's also not true. What about a cat eating man food? You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker. That's a racing stripe. Mmm, I doubt that very much. How next to? I have to pick one of those? Can you go over those options again? Well I have the, the blue book value... Can I think about it? Let me think about it-- Let me think about it-- I'm thinking about it-- Thinking-- It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too. Uh huh... What's the pink? Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this? Other than me. I never said you could do that. I... Okay, I will think about it. No. Yeah... What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You're flipping my car for profit. I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me. Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding w*r for my car on eBay. Like you're applying for a loan. Yeah, and I finished my work months ago! What consequences? Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being "lured" these days. Thank you Dateline! [answers cell] What do you want? Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there? Yep. [Maguire keeps swinging]Angela and Shortcut! Shortcut! [drives cart off course, it flips over] Woah! I fell in the sandtrap! [trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.] Bless you. [Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you. [presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight. Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second... And how many would you like? Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately. Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset. Oh, thank you. I've been working out. Have you? Dwight? I'm confused... Can't do that. Unsanitary. I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman. [watching from his office] Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow. Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already. Why do you hate her? You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me. Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do? We need to sell her an elevator pass. What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. "What do I do?"... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. "Qua" something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close. No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle] Oh. Good for you guys. Yeah. Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked. That's... What do you mean, "Michael"? That's not even my handwriting. [exits conference room] Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?! No! [from outside the conference room] Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It's the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim's computer] Is that the police? Thanks. Almost. [she unlocks Holly's car] Hey. What are you doing? What the hell is going on here?! There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight! Why did you do that? No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World w*r II. Fifty years, she is the best. [to Dwight] Take care of that, all right? Thanks for bringing that up. No. [sees Phyllis; gasps] Oh my God! All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up. [cheering] I'm taking the dumplings for my wife. I'm taking my dumplings. Dwight, Dwight! Michael, it's time. OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays. 2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control. Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only. I thought you had to pee. Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212? Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes. OK. How do you feel about Maine? [Angela picks up phone and dials] I'm on it. I'll see you later, love. [Dwight's pager vibrates, he and Angela walk out] Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it. [walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast. Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer. Oh, my God! Here we go. Everybody on. Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country? Obesity-caused illnesses. Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava. Michael, we have a situation. You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them. Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time. Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her. You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing. I should have been lovers with her first and then friends. That was terrible advice. Terrible advice! You know my seduction method. I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh--- You sabotaged me. You sabotaged me, man! How much weight have you lost, Dwight? No, you're definitely the problem. Yeah. Yes you were. Split the commission? [storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?! There was no client. Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car. I had to walk home with no money and no phone. You left me in a bad part of town! I think of him as more like... a monster? What about, "I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!" No, no, no, NO, no! You know what? Fat people are not monsters! Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject. Bang! Boom! Case in point! Look at the outside of this building. It is ugly. But you come inside... and it is beautiful. Just like this unappealing fat suit. Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man. Hey! Why don't you just sit down, please? Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march. You're right, you're right. Just, Dwight, do it. Just say it ok. I say we have a parade. I know. I suck. Dwight says "Hi." Let's meet for lunch. Yeah. C'mon we'll meet halfway. You'll be back for your 4 o'clock class. I'm gonna write you up for not working. Perfect. Yes! [they embrace and kiss] Hey, sorry everybody. Nothing. To get married. Today is ethics day. After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here. It's gonna be insaaaaane. No, it's not. I have to read from the binder. Hey-oh! Yeah. Yeah, I took intro to philosophy,twice. No big deal. A siesta! Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time? [starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn. Four seconds. Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure. Personal conversation. Seventeen seconds. Actually not. It was really so-so. [Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds. What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds? So I guess I can assume that was personal. So maybe you're not completely ethical after all. Yeah. OK, just remember to keep breathing. [drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion. Oh, OK! OK! I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital. I take Quincy Ave to Gibson. I checked the route - there are no potholes. Come on, get in here and have the baby. Yes! Yeah. [squatting and pushing] Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! All right, OK. [to Andy] Sorry. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go! Do it! Do it! Scream! Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out. Aaaaaaaa! Just keep pushing... I'm right here. I'm right here, I'm right here. [annoyed] All right. Dwight. Just push and breathe. Shhh. No, you can't have it. It's too late. No. You have to just push it out! Keep simulating. OK! Keep simulating. Yes, I do! OK. Yes. Aaaaaaaa! It's coming! Here we go! [drops the watermelon onto the floor] Oh! God! Wow! What was on that? OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up] That was a good story. Really... Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby] She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller. OK, what else? [now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one... [heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don't h*t the fence. Oh no, my child! [throwing the stroller against a high chain link fence] Don't get stuck on the barbed wire! Uh... come on. You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with? That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date. [sigh] What are you making? You're making a Kn*fe with a Kn*fe? You want to talk about it? You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know. Hi. It's nice to learn new things. Okay. What don't you get? Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk. We were robbed last night. [cockney accent] Consider yourself... at home! [Dwight groans] Ugh. Where are we going? Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on. It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much. Mm-hmm. I think you have me confused with another person. 140. 160. Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it? Now you move on. Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer. Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us. Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl. 300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice. 350. 400, 400 hey batter batter. 500. 700. So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm h*tler. I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to b*at me up. I can never tell with those two. 'Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight. Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off! Hey buddy. Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them. Come on, you think you can get into Cornell? I'm sitting right here Dwight. I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy. If you're going my way, I wanna drive you all night long! If you're going my way... Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying "we." You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me. I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red. Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling] It's pronounced "Corn-ell!" It's the highest rank in the Ivy League! Fine. Dwight! Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview. Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in? Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer. The conference room! Let's see how well you know your Big Red history. Who was Cornell's eighth president? Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par. What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention? Nobody wants ...that, to happen. "Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character." "Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations." "Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid." I have everything I need- [talking over each other] And you will be hearing from - which I will not be a part of- And YOU will not be pleased with the result! And your affiliation with Cornell - Will end completely! [Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls] I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet? What, these? Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state. Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. [attempts to bite into a raw beet, beet is too hard] You're supposed to cook these, aren't you? Hey, sport. Ow! God! Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did. No. Wow. Dwight, your feedback is horrible. A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful. No, no, no, no, no. Do I look like I am joking? If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing? It is... more of a spicy brown, actually. How was your meeting with Michael? Was it your scores? Mm-hmm. Of course. Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers. That is me. Wish me luck. Thanks. I love you, too. I'm not talking to you. Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go. [picks up phone] Hello? Wow, that's great, because I need paper. [whispers] Ask him his name. I am Bill Buttlicker. Be respectful, Dwight. Would you hold on one second? That's my other line. Sorry. That was a family emergency. Boundaries, Dwight. Come on! He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go. You're gonna have to talk louder. Son, you have to talk louder. Louder, son! Stop it! Stop it! Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today. [covers phone, whispers to Dwight] See how it's done? [into phone] Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. [to Dwight] See what I did? You have to f*re the salesman that treated me so terribly. Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view] Are you serious? OK, what are you -- What's that? Who's they? In this car? [turns radio down] What are you thinking? The mob, maybe NASA. How many shoes do you need? I'm not talking to you. Pam. [on phone] So I'd like to redouble my order, if you could put me down for, um -- I'm sorry? Hear what? Well, I am breathing, yes. I need paper. Oh, my God. You scared me. What are you talking about? You always say that, and I almost never know. Are you accusing me of something? OK. Easy. You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews. Dwight, let me see your coffee cup. Is that it? I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party. Probably just Kelly. That's what I'm saying. You were right. You were right. You knew it. You knew it the whole time, buddy. Wow. [in New York] Right Dwight is loud. Nothing's going on. What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this. OK, all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just f*re me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends. Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us. OK. [Pam and Jim look worried] Don't. We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers. Oh. Hmm. That's very generous. Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal! [shakes Dwight's hand] Um, what are we talking price wise? [in a singsong voice] Lets do this! Two are for souvenirs. I do. It's right here. [indicates to waist] No, I don't want to wear a bra. Stop it! Stop it! Dwight, can you get those please? What? [noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already? Pam failed art school. Excuse me? Dwight. Oh my God. I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee. I missed you too. [Jim kisses her] Uh, yeah. I'm not going inside. [with mouth full] Yes. So why did you come in here? [watching Toby at Phyllis' desk through his office blinds] Look at him. With his stupid face. Stupid... tan. No. No. I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved. Okay, just summarize. That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to h*t on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act. Mm. Me too. Okay, let's get this started. What are you doing? For what? No, no, no. You're the bait for Toby? No, for one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim. Or Ryan. Or me. Toby can I see those? Ooh. [takes photos and throws them on the floor] What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared? You mad? You mad at me? Do you want to do that? You want to h*t me, you want to punch me? I dare you to. Come on. What's the matter... haaaww! Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on? No do it, do it. I dare you. I'm not going to punch you, Michael. [as Toby picks up his photos] You should have h*t him man, guy was asking for it. Once in a lifetime, man. [mouth full of brownie] Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day. What's that? Frame him? I've never framed a man before, have you? Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I forgot... I forgot... Here? Those are real cops, real g*n. I wonder what's going on. [follows them] Hey, what is this? Hey, what's going on? You don't have my permission to do this. I have a reasonable right to privacy. Ahh, that's mine. Are you kidding me? That's my salad. No. We got a fake tip. No. Yeah, I can't... really can't move him. Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms... I mean, like, "156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left." "Walk until you hear the beehive." I think Andy makes an excellent point. But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom. Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench. [shudders] Whew. Hmm... mm, what's that smell? Manure. Get rid of it. Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day? Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before? See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh. [laughs] Hahaha!... well... No. I haven't thought of it. I would like cat. I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat. I want a butter sculpture of a cat! Oh... ah, I almost choked. Hey-o! I work with Dwight. What? I do. Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy. What do you mean? Dwight! That doesn't count! No, it doesn't! I didn't- We are not married. Take this thing. [takes off twine ring] Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas. Five minutes actually. I am a black belt in gift wrapping. I think it'll take you a little longer than that. Ah. You brought in your doll collection. These are not dolls, Jim. These are commodities. Same as gold or oil. That's the Christmas spirit. Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out. 120, 180... 200. Thank you so much. My daughter is going to love this. Thanks. You too. [Meredith's hair is on f*re] Oh, oh, oh, oh! Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand] Okay, no, that's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don't you have anything? No, I like Meredith. [amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no. No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting. But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on f*re today. What about tomorrow.? What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead? I s*ab her in the brain with a wooden stick. Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore. The next time you light yourself on f*re we are not going to help put you out. Dwight-- [sighs]...okay. Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that. I can get you one in an hour. This is great. My ex-wife's going to be so pissed. [chuckles] For once daddy's gonna be a hero. Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls. I was-- I was gonna get the doll. Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight. I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party. Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar g*n. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard. Wow, thirteen! No. No, no. There was wind. I can't take it anymore. I am telling Andy. Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight? [on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself... No. Please stop. [grabs a spoon from Jim's coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon. don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. [sings] Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep. [makes chomping sound] What is it? That is a terrible idea. One of your worst. You're expanding on your worst idea. I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it? Well? This is really not how this is supposed to happen. When will she be ready? Is she crazy in bed? Okay, listen. This shouldn't happen at work. I am already walking. Okay, what does that mean? But you're leaving... [to Dwight] What are you standing for? You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin. [Dwight enters] Dwight. It's over. No. It's over between you two. You have to. [forcefully] She doesn't love you. She's marrying me. Angela Bernard. It will be her name. And you will have to call her that! I'm telling you to back down. Then I'll make you. Through the use of force. Nope. Fine! This is nuts. Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because... Guess what? Not happening at work. We're gonna do it outside. None of your business. My bare hands. 00 in the parking lot. [softly] What a coincidence. [collects Dwight's w*apon from around the office; holds up a hand scythe] [opens his office door] Yeah, finish up. I guess people have fewer choices as they get older. Hey, has anything happened yet? Oh come on, man! Believe in something. Yeah. Andy's running over Dwight with his car. Oh! You give up? I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance! Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton? Dwight! Are your legs broken? Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this! What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods... I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice? What! I'm her fiance. [enters, followed by Dwight, and makes a call] Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, that's the one. Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. [sighs] Ahh! Looks like a red wire. Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires. Doesn't it? So what do we do now? I will seduce her. No, I will seduce her. No, I got it. Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support. Michael Scarn. Okay. [interrupting] No. No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP. No! [arguing over each other] Oh, don't start, You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP. You will have pancakes and you'll like it. So what? Maybe they are shrinking. They could be shrinking. Ah ha [popping something in his mouth] Yup. Mm hmm . And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business. Argh, why are you all... Shut up. Ready to do this? Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? [picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion] Is this the cup? [picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion] Is this what I drink out of? [glug noise, both laugh] Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession. Hi, I'm afraid we're not hiring right now. That's my son. Try 80. I sure hope not. So why are you considering leaving Dunder Mifflin? Hey, hey, how is your interview going? I... Okay, okay, okay, [in disbelief] alright, thank you. [heads towards Dwight, makes make out lips signal] Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time. I cannot wait to contact your clients. Haha, we struck the mother load! Wallace is going to freak. He's going to absolutely freak. Oh sh**t. Oh God, what was that? No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears] Aw, it's alright. Aw, my car. It sounded bad. No no, we are fine. You have done enough already. No, no, really not necessary. See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot. Oh coffee, that's too much. [Dwight drinks it] Gosh, well so long. [they exchange byes] Ok, goodbye Prince Family. Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye. Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information? Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine. Why don't we just, live and let live? Live and let live. It's from James Bond. I'm not going to make this call. My heart says... That is true. That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times. Jan... Ryan. I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot. You're right. You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info. Just something I have to do first. Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows] Oh sh**t! [gets to his car turns around] Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot] Those people will be ruined. [runs out back door] Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people. Okay, bye bye. Last week I gave a f*re safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention. It's my own fault for using PowerPoint. PowerPoint is boring. People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher. [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives. [throws cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid] Did you bring your jerky in again? Whoa, f*re! The phones are dead. It's out in the hall. Oh my God! Okay, it happening. Everybody stay calm. Stay [bleep] calm! Everyone, now [bleep] calm down! [groaning] Oh my God. Try a different door. Don't run. It-- it's warm. Back door. Get out of the way! Go, go, go! Okay, we're trapped. Everyone for himself. [shouting] Out of my way! Let's go. Get out of my way! Get out of the way! Move it! [pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay. Shh shhh. Oscar. I only weigh 82 pounds! Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh! What do we do? I'm about to die! What?! How could you possibly think this is a good idea? Electricity. You could have b*rned down the whole building. Did you shout, "f*re!", causing a panic? Take hedded of. Heed. Heed. Take heed of. Take heed of. Can you shove down? Instead... shove down, please. Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer. And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice. Something that Dwight doesn't like. What? [sighs] No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands. Yeah. That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man. Yes. I'm a smart guy. I'll figure it out. Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means "always be closing." Would you like to try next? Yeah, okay. You didn't maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didn't arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him. I have no idea. We bury him? He is an organ donor. Yeah. What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing? Dwight! Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy? Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy? Hi, everyone. Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret? Let's hear it. You couldn't of memorized that? It is a big deal. You almost k*lled Stanley. I don't get it. Do I stress you out? Oh... I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this. Hey, this is your apology letter. Yeah... yep. Oh, stop it Dwight. No no no no no no! Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way. That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot. Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks. That reeks, and I'm trying to eat. I think he meant personal day. Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box] Michael! It's really good to see you. Screw you. [Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead. Okay. Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama. [pushes Dwight's finger away] Just, easy. Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life. Screw you guys. You're dead to me. Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that. I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again. In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it. [partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding? Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons? What is that? [looks at sign that says "IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY."] It is your birthday period. Not even an exclamation point? I can't believe how bad this looks. Okay, good then. I am working on it. Six dollars. I said I was working on it. We lost the account. [over the phone] How old's Kelly? It's Mose. Who do you think it is? Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she? Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation? [sighs] I'll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around] So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! [laughs] [whispers] I've been driving too long. Stop yelling at me! I didn't do anything! Hey! What the hell's goin' on? I was kickin' it. What? Yep. Got it. Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy. My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday! Birthday. There's always a theme. Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake. Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about? You know what? I could use a little help. We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign? [to camera] What? I'm not in love with her. I'm not writing, "Horse Hunt." I don't even know what that means. [grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting. Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved? Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one. Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome. Surprise! [shakes her head no] That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television. Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping. I love it. Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each? All right. Surprise. [giggles] Thank you. I'm too excited to sleep. Thanks. [both eat cake] Ayyyy! [running from his desk] Ayyyy!Jim, Pam, Michael and Ok. I'm, uh, I'll be going.Jim, Pam, Michael and I understand that. So suck it. Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only. So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other. Yup, a little. How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm] You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this. No, no, no, no. I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too. We just need to find them. There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together. No. Not a giant net. I was thinking maybe like a mixer. Old fashioned meet market -- -- I don't think it is. Hey. Ah, still early. [sighs] So how you holding up? No. No, I meant about being single today. Meh, exactly. Eh. Oh, here we go. Hello. [two women, a blonde and a redhead, enter the office. Michael and Dwight walk towards them and Dwight extends his hand to the redhead] Thank you, Michael. I- I- believe you. Um, I work at a place that does catalogs for community colleges and small businesses. It's going very well. People are mixing, a lot of hope. Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in. Um, so [looking at his watch] it's not too late. No reason. Why do you always go to that? Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office? She could be your soul mate. Good Valentine's. OK. [Blonde stands up to leave] Look, I'm gonna go... Look, we already have a paper supplier. Hey, you don't deserve her. That was helping. It was classic. No... God. Alright. Who's there? KGB - [Dwight slaps Michael on the face] What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight] What are you doing? You, you like that? Dwight, get the door. Ding dong. Ding dong. The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs] [Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea. Woah, wow, who told you that? [same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight. I'm not taking... I'm not taking... Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary. Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets. Why do you have a diary? OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up. Yes, you did. What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary] Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us? We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking-- Umm, nacho chips. Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me. Oh, not gonna happen. Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly. Yes they are, you just don't care about the information. He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired. I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion... Right. That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom. That's why you made the decision. That's why you made... You kind of have. You cannot take the fall for him. He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do? Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight. [holds out hand for handshake] Alright Dwight. This is huge. Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea? Really? How did-- how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight? And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize. [going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight. Good work, kid. This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you. David? David? Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs] [on speakerphone] Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away. No. No dogs. It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea. No, no. Oh how dare you. You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard? Oh please. Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge... ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas. They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom. [same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true? When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours. I want to see it. I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary] Give me... Give me the diary. Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh! Who is it? Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second. Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine. If you want to come back then, that'll be fine. I get back from work around 6. You can try. That, that might work. I like it. [wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough? And classy, yeah. Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously. Yes. He is. That's what makes him classy. Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind. That's inspired. You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish. Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! [swings arm above head for everyone to come, hits doorframe] Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on! Well- You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know. I'll give it my best sh*t, Michael. Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? [several seconds of silence] [on phone] Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks. David Wallace's office. Good. Thank you. Alright. . . Cool. Any good headhunter knows I am available. Okay. No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions. That's a really... well fine, Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do? Hmm... Ehh... [in accent] well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it? Um... hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that? Potential, lots of potential. yes. It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um... That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing. So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now. Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on. Kev, c'mon. Hey-o! [applauding and cheering] [whispering] Would you please stop that? You're breathing very heavily. No it's not. Good. As I was saying... You bet. Well I do. I play. Well, maybe you should get back to work. Maybe we will someday. That's a great idea, Dwight. Yeah. What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer? I'm in it to win. C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play? What? What do you think? Thank you! Oh. Really? Why was she in this building? That's crazy. Oh my god! Hmm. Oh! [Dwight and Erin laugh.] Yeah. Just got some ice. So I'll see you guys around! They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get? Um, nerthing? Pffft. The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man. No, that's ridiculous. Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so- Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good! What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty. Really?[Dwight plays a hearty strum of the song, Andy stands and starts a banjo solo] West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River [Andy vocalizes] Take me home, country roads, to the place, I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads. [Erin leaves] Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song. Better a cappella! Yeah. Name another. Better a cappella. What's wrong with you? I think you look nice. Looking good. 'Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay. Hey. [gestures to 'Bed & Breakfast' magazine] Is this good? Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh? I really appreciate it. It's for your trouble. No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this. Yes, I do. That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go? I'm here. I'm a part of this now. Dwight, take a seat. Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately? I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed. Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused. And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week? Definitely. [on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin. Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well? I'm not following you. Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift. Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing? Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying "He's talking about you!"] [Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us? Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now? So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you? Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot? Dwight? Is the cool new guy Charles? Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright? He did. I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it] Hello, traitor. Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby. He's in a meeting. So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh? You sound worried. Wow. High score? And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown. Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want? So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy? No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no- Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet. Toward the sun. Noon. You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running] Dwight. I hope you're not recording this conversation. [Dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt] Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles. So you just rat me out? You could have said no. If you want a truce, I will give you a truce. I do too. Cooper's. [Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at? Really? That's weird. We didn't see any. What? Yeah, sure. [Michael answers phone] Yeah. Dwight, not now, we've been robbed. No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. [Pam holds up sign saying "Dwight did it!!"] You? What about our truce? On purpose? Why? Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it. Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] Bastard! Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say. [holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, "great salesman, better friend." [turns card over] "Tall" and "beets." Dwight, do you mind if we talk? If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed. Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client. Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now. Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much. Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates. What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow? Uh, hello, Dwight. Oh- That's very rude. Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our- I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin... Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month. Good, good, good. I will see you. I color code all my info. I wrote "gay son" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means "Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?" Most colors mean "Don't say it." No, they were your client. They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company. I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault- Uh, well said, Angela. Hey, David. Okay, great. Uh, Dwight come on in. Also, Jim. God, no. I agree. Really? Does he do good work or-- Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out. Okay. Hey, Dwight. Can I talk to you? Good, right? Hello. We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once] Yeah, yeah. Oh, but you didn't. I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction. Are you kidding me? Dwight. What? How'd you hear that? Great work Dwight. No, I mean, great detective work. 'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right? What are your top five cases? Because you've solved zero cases. Okay, do not go anywhere near the conference room. Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today. Got it? Got it. Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan. [scattered applause] And how about casual Friday again, huh? Reinstituting casual Friday? You all look great. What I want to do right now is try something a little different. I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting. I want you guys to run it. I want you to say whatever you want, take it away. Your meeting. Not important. [everyone mutters] Okay, alright. Yes. Yes, you have a job. Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen. You mean the clients you stole from us. Okay. Yep. "New File System". I am not changing the way I do my files. No, no. This goes for all of you. Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words. Andrew Bernard. What are you still doing not at your desk? All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order-- Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn. Stop doing rhyming poetry. Just tell them, please. God, the simplest thing. Can I address that? Okay. It's not right. I don't like it. You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary. [sighs] No offense, Jim. I think she's very pretty. I don't know. I saw a crowd. I thought there might be a dogfight or something-- Those sound too harsh. Of course. What is like a hostage? We could write a strong-worded letter. Strongly-painted picture. Can I just say something? I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly. Great. See you upstairs. Hey g*ng. Where you been? I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich. I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart. Is there anything I can do to make things better? Exactly. Exactly. This is your first complaint in ten years. Things have been generally good. Look, uh, Mr. Bart... At these prices with this service... You're not gonna find this anywhere else. No, no, no. Sir, don't listen. Who let this boy on the phone? You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time. It's okay, Ryan. Okay. Hey, hey guys. You know what I want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, Dwight. You guys gotta be kidding. That's right. I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing. Whatever you guys did earlier. Just do it, okay? Get 'em there. Get 'em there. Are you kidding me? Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along. [everyone mutters "okay"] However, I rescind my apology. All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights. All right, come. Sit down, Dwight. I'm running this meeting. [whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that. Shut up. Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on? Hi, guys. How you doing? Right. I'm sorry. Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio? So someone is going to a court. Big deal. Are you all afwaid? Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it. Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie. No. No. No. Oh, no. No. No. This is no good. I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok? [barging through office door] Alright. Here we go. What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital. I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy. I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner. Dwight! Dwight! I do. That feels good, Dwight. Right... mmmm... right there. I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, " This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you." [Angela shows Michael the papers again] No. An hour? I can't stay here an hour. No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now. But the rattler's so scary. I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle] Wanna dance, Dwight? Mind if I steal my wife? [whispering] I can do it. [whispering] What do you need from me? [mumbles in his sleep as Pam and Jim change the clocks in his office] See you later! Well... Ah, 40. Insect repellent, which we clearly need, reduces the effectiveness of SPF. Woah. Homemade? Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh] No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it. Well, I could've d*ed, so... I looked it up online afterwards. Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row? If- Uh... [laughs sheepishly] That's... ... not what I meant. [playing volleyball] I got it. [Kevin misses] Are you blind?! Can you see things with your eyeballs?! We've been out here for a while. I don't need this. [grunts in frustration] So what? Nice job, Beesly. Crystal cool. Set! Ow, my ankle! I... twisted it. You suckers are goin down! They're gonna wipe their asses with your serves! Piss all over your faces! Really funny. Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances. How do you figure? one whore. What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions- No way! You don't mean that! [running for the ball] I got it! Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot. We'll be back! Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay? All right! Come on. Dwight. Dwight. Okay. Parkour! This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital. [approaching elevator, as Michael films] Parkour! Parkour! Do me! Do me! Ow! Get off! Get off! [walking across cars in parking lot, Dwight filming] Parkour! Parkour! Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, [camera pans to refrigerator boxes, then dumpster] 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.Michael & Parkoooooour! [leaps from trailer, disappears into empty refrigerator box]Michael & [inside refrigerator box, sounding injured] Parkour! [hands Dwight a cup of water] There you go. Is there anything else I can do? [nods] Mm hmm. [confused] Mm-kay. [approaches Dwight's desk] You'll never guess what I know. Eric likes Megan. [annoyed] How do you know this? Stanly is having a midlife crisis. [with everyone assembled in conference room] Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors. Why would we call you at night? [to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs. Nowhere. Don't vaccinate it. Yes. This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away. If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare. Be quiet. Thanks T-Man, later. [fist bumps Toby} He has a doctor's note. A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house. It was on the news. That's not a very good Darryl. Hmmm. [spying at Darryl's house] Sounds like a EMDP-40. You're into trains? Wow. That's so cool. Wow, I'd love to take a look at that. Well, you know, 'cause of the trains. Uhh, oh boy, oh boy. Get over there! Get over there! I can't believe this. [mistaking Darryl's sister for Darryl] Hey you, ass****! You gonna eat all that dog food yourself? I tried to keep Michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark. You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food. Why would you think a lady is me? Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you. Cool. What? Stupidest thing I've ever heard. Alright, yeah fine so whatever... You really did it... And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister. Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second. [Michael picks up phone] Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything. If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay. Is that what you want to do? Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement? [shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them] No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic. Ah, ah, ah. Where's the "please"? We're not animals. No, not without a "please." Idiot. That is not big picture. ... Okay. That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day. You're trying to trick me. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about? Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen? Okay. And how do you feel? All right. Did he h*t you? Did you cry? Did you feel like crying? I'm just gonna write "held back tears." If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it. I'm not cr-- uhh! No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?! Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so-- Yeah. I am so pissed at this company! Yeah. Who said that? Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in] People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary w*r would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly. What the hell?! Yeah, I would, too. I say no. We would really appreciate it. Now this is getting ridiculous. What the hell? Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married. Yes. I said that yesterday. Dwight... No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke. Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe. Get out of here. Oh, my God, Dwight. There's... a name. Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn. Ok. Is that all you have on her? [in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep. Those glasses are super dark. Alright. We need some tunes, I think. You did? That was nice of you. Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in. Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room? One moment while I check. Oh, ok. Unfortunately, sir, the block only applies to the rate. I'm afraid we're all sold out. Yes. Schrute. Sure. No problem. Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room. I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight. I would do the same for you. Yes. Yes... just go-- Oh. Thank God. Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why. If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay. Ok. I don't have a room? Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.' [laughs] No no. She's my girlfriend. Hey? Can you make room at the head table? Why would they make the bad man a boss if you're so much smarter? Ewwww! Head table, where I belong. Well, who's that one? What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight? That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider. That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope. That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. [no one is laughing] What are you wearing? Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight. Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice. Wait. You're worried about your horses? That's cool. How many horses do you have? Nine and three-quarters. [talking to an attractive woman] Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar. Yes. Why? Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you. They're men, Dwight. [over phone] And Dwight. Mmm! It's after midnight. [points at Jim]Michael and You're married. [hugs Jim] He's married! That's not how that works. Oh my God. You're not going to be able to talk back. She'll be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons." [Dwight laughs] "And... and clip my toenails." Okay. Hmm-hmm. Yeah. So you sure you don't want breakfast? It's the most important meal of the day. That's really sweet, Dwight. So I'll see you at the wedding? K. [they kiss] Bye. [passes Isabel] Hey, good morning. [to Dwight] It's about damn time. I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half. [walks into hotel room] Oh my God, Dwight. This room is a pit. [watching Dwight eat breakfast] How can you eat like that? Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself. She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger. She was from Europe. Uh-huh. No. Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me? She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe? No... you're crazy. She's-- okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in. It-- it-- Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory. [holds up painting] And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me. No. No, but I'm allowing it. Just come here. Hello stranger. How do I look? Um... [shakes head] nothing. Anymore. Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes. What? [sighs] What do you think? Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman. He drives an SUV! Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob? Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down! Um it is, Grotti.Andy and No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it. Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences. [reads email] "I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business." Yeah. [hangs up, rips cord from phone] That is the stupidest thing you could do right now! Shh! That's not gonna happen. I was thinking exactly the same thing. Dwight... Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting. Okay. Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a w*apon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing. Should I change? Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it. Oh my God! Hi. If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy. I don't, I don't have to have that. That's okay. I don't... Okay, okay okay. Yep, all right. It was before, my tech- my technical training. Do it. Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow? Okay. I had to make a snap decision Dwight. It was a lot of snap decisions. Yes! All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks. He's alive. So you're welcome. Yeah, some of that existed before. You're right, that is new. Well I don't see that happening. Are you saying- That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain? That seems a little far-fetched. Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened. No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy. His background is perfectly clean. He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman. You suck! And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance. No. What do you mean? What? So I looked him in the eye and I said, "Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead." I said something like that. Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there? Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind. [gasps] It is? It's good to be home. Do we have a conversation scheduled? Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you. [duck voice] You're welcome! [quacks, laughs] I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing. It's a real handsome duck. [screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window] Okay. [sighs] Feels good. I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner. [both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better. I know, right? Who wants to help the world one step at a time? [Dwight raises his hand] Alright, good. Shut up Oscar. What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother! Hi Dwight! Well, I think I have that persona. What the hell is a mallard? Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me. If you take it back, I'll scream. Twenty. [walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back. [speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy. A wooden duck? Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage... Silence. I won't. But, you will wash and buff our car. I'd rather not say. I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] ...and a clown. It rained. Ok. Yes. And when you fell in, did you flounder? We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right? [writes 'Koi pond' on the list] Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on. Your nose? Oh my. That is small. What keeps your glasses on? No, no. Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem. Jim, you let Michael fall in. I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away] Judas. Thank you. [reaches for bagel] Wow. H & H. You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels? Thanks. Oh, don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one. Morning Dwight. No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers. Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs. Well, yeah... It worked. I don't mind if I do. I'm taking one for my lady friend. Brain food. Thank you very much. Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me. Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Geez. When did everyone get so cynical? Oh, no thank you. Oh, Dwight. I have a little surprise for you. Yes! [they laugh] And I wanted to return the favor. I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory. Feel it against your cheek. You give me a gift-- Bam! Thank you note. You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP. You do me a favor-- Wham! Favor returned. Do not test my politeness. Whoa-- Thank you very much. Now I've got it for you. [holds open door] Is that right? Huh. [laughs; follows Dwight] That really works. Hey-- oh, hold on a second. Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus. Whoa-- thank you very much. [takes off Dwight's glasses and blows on them] Oh boy. [puts Dwight's glasses back on Dwight's face] You are very welcome. [pulls out Dwight's chair] Have a seat yourself. Not necessary. You didn't have to do that. [singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food] Andy bought lunch. Yep, yep. Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness. You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone. Whoa, whoa Dwight. I'm going to do this. No, I insist. Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous. [reaching for something on the top shelf] Ahh. Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me. What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something? That is a recipe for a ghost. It's like a little envelope-- there you go. Surprise! [laughs] It's from everybody. $15 value. No. You were right. I don't know. Ahh... [Dwight is holding a frozen chicken to his face] Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight. No. What are you talking about-- Forget that. No. Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change. OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know. No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace. OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you. So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it? And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two. Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool. You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand. It was hilarious. Yes? You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day. Woo hoo, shout out! Oh God. Well, that's an interesting theory. Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that. You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK? [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the p*stol was kept. No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing. Alright, a plan it is. It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter. I know you did it! No it ain't. I thought it was for real. So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game. I already declared you, it was too dark to tell. This is not a game, this is my life. You are out of order, sir. You are out of order. [laying on the ground] I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks. Super. [Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary g*n at each other] I didn't do it! On the count of three we're all going to put down our g*n. We'll put down our w*apon on the count of three, you ready? [Dwight enters dressed as Recyclops] Not again. Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops. The next year he really stepped things up. A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape. Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was att*cked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember. Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops. Oh, is today Recyclops Day? I thought you were k*lled by Polluticorn. That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment. Lose the twirl. [everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo] Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that. Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs. Definitely. Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed. I will have to answer. Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park. Kay. For those of you with questions, please line up behind one of the four microphones that have been placed in the aisles. Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts] Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis? Sure. Excuse me? It'll just be a second. ... and we're confident. There are many things to be optimistic about in Dunder Mifflin's future and one of them is here with us today. Michael Scott, Scranton Branch manager. The gentleman in the, uh, glasses. Thank you. Thank you for your suggestions. Jim's talking to Michael right now. They totally went for our idea! Yeah! Your idea. Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse? Not much. [laughs] Thanks Dwight. You're creeping me out. I'm gonna go. Let me guess, you think you should get it. Well, in an ideal world... Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away "Survival Skills" and "Self-defense." Wow! Hey. Jim said that? Jim said that? No, no, that makes total sense. Sure. [puts in the twenty] Are you kidding me? Dwight? Okay. That's fair. How is that possible? No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible? "It could only be you!" Way to go. David Wallace's office. No, he's in his weekly staff meeting, can I take a message? Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam. [imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson. Jim Halpert is a menace. I really don't know how it happened, David. Uh, hey, I'm sorry. I'm taking this out on you. It's been crazy here. You know I think you're doing a great job, right? Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend? Okay. See you. See you tomorrow, Dwight. How's it going? Good day? Um, okay, so, um, listen. I know about your diabolical plan. I found a copy of it in the copier tray. Too loud. Too, too loud. Too Loud. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Good. My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed. No, it's not "ugh." It is... office camaraderie. Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it? Why would you start so high? No. We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together. Pam! Yes. We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree? Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus! Yeah. Aw, Michael! How do you know it's a g*n? Not a g*n. Well, unless the missing piece is a g*n, you don't have a g*n. This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch! [on karaoke microphone] Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit? You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some... jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room. "It's fun to stay at the -" What? David told me on the phone. David told me. Earlier today. What? David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse. Yeah! [office erupts in cheers and applause and hugs] It's a Christmas miracle! Woo hoo! [climbs on desk, stage dives into crowd of employees] [singing] I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone. [Meredith and Madge help right the Christmas tree] [opens "New Moon" poster] Jim.... Jim! [Hugs him] Oh! You got it? What is that? [Dwight building his gift] Huh. Well, maybe those will help. [puts bag of walnuts on his desk] Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I'm doing, Pam. Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays. - follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the cr*ck HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two. [Toby's chair spins around to reveal Dwight filling in for Toby] So, um, the manager, Michael Scott... is a bit of a character. What are, are you doing at my desk? Come on, Dwight. Get out of here. That's, that is true. [clip montage] Have a great day. [extended Lazy Scranton video] Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'. They call it Scranton! The Electric City. Scranton! The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider. Plenty of space in the parking lot. Snack att*ck time. They call it Scranton! The Electric City. Scranton! The Electric City. Scranton! The Electric City. Scranton! The Electric City. Scranton! Oh! [rips open cardboard box] Wow. Awesome. [distributing items] For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you. Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control - Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened... And distributed things which should not have been distributed. Well, maybe we can put the box back together. Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. [holding up photo of him and Wallace] You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons. We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right? Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre. I don't know what they're made of. What? No. No. [to hotel employee on phone] We're trying to look it up right now. Um, come on. Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation. Oh. Yeah, we changed it since it was a while back. I do apologize.Michael and [to Dwight] Hello. Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room? I think that's it. So we're all good! [many employees raise their hands] Thanks ya'll. Mm! [on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88... [walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster! Just admit you lost track of time. Did you see Saw? No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw? Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment. Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something? Yes! We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't k*ll him, obviously. I have a mask... Well suggest something else then! Don't just... Don't just criticize my idea! [on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there. Nick. Like Frodo! Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum. Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum. Nice! Why not? It's part of the sales experience. It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all. Uh, yep. No, I actually don't. I think that you should call the cops. You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps. And you guys are okay with this? Yep. Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael! Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel. I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not? Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know. [on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave... Yeah, I'm pregnant... Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks. [on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby? Oh, thank you very much. I'm excited. Oh, definitely. There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it. [on the phone with a client] Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay. [as Nick looks over at her] What are you looking at? Did you know that labor can last weeks? Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself. Excuse me? Good afternoon. What is this? Of course. You know I was thinking... I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy. [reading from various books] Five to seven minutes. Five to seven minutes. Six minutes. Different, but not really. Five to seven minutes. Jedediah. Jedediah. No Star Trek names. What if it's a girl? Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here. No. I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please! The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus! I didn't know we had a tape measure. Dwight, what is the traffic like? Alright. Geesh, Dwight! What!? Where? Okay, go, go, go, go! Let's go! I'm texting about you, okay!? Pull over! Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go. [as he calls Dwight] Ready? Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday. Dwight! Go to my house. Get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is under... Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the... It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here. Okay, I'll just go get the other guy. Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you? I look forward to it. [entering the Halpert house] Hello? Dwight? What, what are you doing here? Wow, ha. New cabinets. All I did was bring macaroni and cheese... Where's the fridge? Oh... Well, I'll let you get back to it. Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too. Yeah... [smoking a cigar] There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love. And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today... I think I'm going to be sick... And now you, two forms of ID, please... Alright, all is in order. I just need your signature... What is it? Alright. How would you like to celebrate? Hey... [reveal Dwight's Mega-Desk] What do we got here? Of course. Hm hm. Okay. [Pulls desks apart] Just gotta... Okay. Come on! Jim! No. [re-enters bullpen from kitchen.] No. No-no-no-no-no. [swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine? Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone] It is. Big time. Pretty amazing. Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons. Is that what happened to you? That's a common mistake. And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now. What? Right. Yeah that's great. Great. [Whispers] Please stop that! Can you grow up? [On business call] Yeah.Andy and No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--Andy and You know, can I call you back?Andy and That would be great, thank you.Andy and Oh, you don't become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off. [Scoffs] You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both! Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles "Cat's in the Cradle" song] Sorry Sugar. What'd you want? Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you. Oh! No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk. Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk] When are we getting to sales topics? Dwight? I would like your undivided attention, please. make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order. Yeah. M-hmm. Is that all you have to say to me? Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out! Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering] Michael's stupid scavenger hunt. [taps car] Lincoln. [holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too. The leads are in? Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'. You are never going to find them. I'm going to enjoy this. [muffled] I'm still enjoying it. Turn the trash. Turn the trash. It's coming off anyway. If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads. Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself. I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up. You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me. [kicking through rubbish at the dump] You've changed, man. Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent. No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight. Assistant to the managed him - Yeah. You think you would have done better without me? Really? Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you - You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies - That's my wife you're talking about, man. If I wanted to h*t you, I would have h*t you. No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. [they throw volleys of rubbish at each other] No, time out, time out. [Michael inspects a box, then hurls it at Dwight] Time in! Don't even think about that [Dwight begins rolling it towards Michael, as he reaches him Dwight kicks it and falls backward. The spool comes to a halt in front of Michael, and Michael pushes it towards Dwight.] Okay, Dwight. Here we go [picks up a sink, spills dump juice on his pants] oh god. We're never going to find those leads, are we? [they both sit on the edge of a claw-footed bathtub] This [picks up racquet] Why would somebody throw that out? Yeah, she does - she loves purple. [Dwight sniffs it] Does it stink?  In the dump. No! Better! Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat. How many is that? Count the last one. Oh, new record! My respect. [everyone returns to work] Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups - Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down. And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that- Mm-hmm. A girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this. Do you? Oh, air hockey, basketball, we could play that. Oh, whack-a-mole. Three brothers. Two are in the Marines, one's a cop. No. I love meat. O-negative. Universal donor. Universal donor. [startled by Angela, curses] [Isabel and Dwight playing whack-a-mole] You are amazing at this. How did you get so good? Whack! Whack! This looks like a hoot. Whack. Okay. It's no worry. I could see enjoying that. But we signed the contract. I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen. Well, I think that he could counter that move. The Scranton strangler is a professional strangler. Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute. You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court. What are you talking about? Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me. Did he not tell you that? Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract? You'll see me in small claims court! No. I won't say it. It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street. Mm-hmm. Thank you. I do. I literally did not know that existed until this moment. What's up? No, no, he's right. That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump? You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay? Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know? Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight. And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that. Great. Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology. Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] "Or cookies." You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the g*ng. Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight! Guten tag, Herr Michael. Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple. I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company. Sounds all right. Oh, this is "Print in All Colors," Sabre's minority executive training program. I didn't say "a'ight." You have to be a minority. Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities. Hmm? I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something? [on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing. I don't know if she was white. Yeah. Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right. Never thought of myself as an executive before. I can't think of any CEO's, any race. I could be the Indian Julia Roberts. Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes] Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy. Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky. Okay... Oh, that is so good. Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me. Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in. And then the two of us are cleanin' house. What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point. What? Yeah, but she's not white, though. I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though. Namaste. Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door] Holy cow. I'd be so happy. I know. I meant I'd be happy for them. Dwight, I know these programs. "Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow." Mm! Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is. For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them. What are you doing? God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves] Why? I don't need translator. Great. Thank you, Dwight. I'll never forget everything that you've done for me. Because I never forget anything.  Stop what? It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, "I will when you lose the baby weight." It's a pen. Get back to work, Dwight. Please. That's fun. No, Michael, no. All right. [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, "I love you." Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's k*lling me. [whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator. This is you. How much do you charge? I'll give you $50. Money's no object. Okay. Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said "Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient." [smiles] Oh, hi. You work for Michael. Right. Donna, hi. [sighs] All right. [calls Dwight] Thank you. You okay? [chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about. Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here. Nope. I'm good, thanks. Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat? Get out of my way. Huh! I'm out of here. You stay away from me, or I'm calling security. You're back. What happened? No, what happened with Donna? Ugh! No. No! Are you sure? Who eats eight protein bars? Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over. What? No, she didn't say that. I'm the mistress? Excuse me. Yeah, I'd appreciate it if you'd just let me run this. Don't listen to him, we're approaching a cooldown down a gentle hill. No, guys, no. We're just cooling down... Okay, alright. I would k*ll Bin Laden and then Toby. Yes, we s*ab Toby through the heart with an icicle. [shouting] Toby, just do it! God! Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left] No, out! Get out now! Leave now. Leave! Hello! No. Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract. Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over. Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it. I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting. Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red] Same page. Go to the next one. Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix-- This is essentially... Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor. Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract. So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000. What? I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism. He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune. Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document] Look, I don't think that's actually legal. Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela] Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses. Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy. I want eye contact. Yes. You'll learn, baby. You'll learn. Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes] I could have stopped him. No. What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location] Well, it better work. Please. Hey Dwight. Mind if I get in there for a second? Just one... [Dwight pushes Nick's neck to the desk and pushes his arm up] Gah! Ah! Dwight, what the hell? The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother. Okay Dwight. Well, I'm inclined to believe you. Yeah, I noticed you've had a great year. Good boy... you turning that money into more money? I don't like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain't investing in property, then you're dumber than a dummy. Okay. You can count on me. I'm hungry. [on phone] The property you're looking at is in great shape. By the way, it has a very spacious basement office. [on phone] I just need you to come by later and sign a few forms. What time works for you? [Dwight looks across the street] Mr. Schrute, what time works? Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels? Who is the whistleblower? You, you guys have fifteen parties a week, you can't learn my name? I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too. You don't say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston.
