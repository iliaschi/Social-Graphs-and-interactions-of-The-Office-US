Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us? That's cool. Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs. Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite. [pulls Toby's pants down] Beow! [laughs] Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax? Oh, and I get to carry it. Have a seat, I'll write it down. I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office. Hey Toby. What's this? [holds up memo Toby has passed out to the staff] [reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection. Oh really. Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight... [to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity. Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us? Hey Toby. Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company. Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles] Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...? What? Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did. I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant][ New Scene ] [under his breath] Nice to meet you. Yeah, sure. I'll, uh, I'll see you tonight, right? Whoa. Easy tiger. Okay. Bye guys. Nice to meet you. Whoa, Toby. Watch out. You're going to violate your own PDA memo. How did he use it again? Thank you. Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside? Fine. I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book. Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading. Yep. No, I mean I really liked it. I thought was uh, a fun read. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, that wasn't fun. How does it end? I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen. Morning. Did you sleep in cabins? Who went? Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, "No more s'mores, no more s'mores." [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room] [from outside] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up. Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks r*fle into safety mode] on. Toby. Oh, thanks man. Is there anything -- Oh, OK. What? I remember that. Seriously? No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps. Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition? OK, let's make ten copies of this diary. [looking for a place to sit, goes to Toby's table] Can I sit here? Aren't we trying to determine whether Michael or Jan were engaged in a romantic affair? Not Michael and this Ryan person. I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number? Aw! That's great Toby. Toby, you're the best. Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or... We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas. OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go. I know how to throw a football. I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles] ...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water. Ugh, what? What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened. That? In the conference room? We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did I stutter," and I said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" It was joking, Toby, alright? "Hey um, you're poor." "Well hey, you're mama's dead." That's what friends do. It's... you're so white. Mmhmm. Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but... Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright? Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left. Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days. Mornin'. [to camera] So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And... [watch beeps] I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel? Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson? As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day. I love the view. I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word "perfect" in here! Hmm? [knock on door] Yeah. Oh, hey, do you still work here? Nah. No. I think I will pass. [to Toby] What did you do to him? Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica. Well I was taking the picture. Sure, do you have a camera here? Okay... [knocks files off desk] Sorry. Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party? I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'. [enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes? Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed. [takes out note cards] I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are? Thank you. [reads] What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin? Well, no no no no no... Oh, I'd like to hear the answer. [hides his face from Holly; whispers to Toby] I'll k*ll you. I guess everything's okay. Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which... Well... That's my watch. What's protocol on this? Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it. Oh, yeah, um... Sure. Meredith, do you mind? Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird. Well this is it. I am here to see you off. Sorry. Corporate policy. Okay, security guard. I don't know about anyone else. But it was a good summer for me. I lost seven pounds. And you know what? I'm just gonna take five days off anyway. Hmmm, dare I? [laughs] You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake. [walks to the annex, standing in Toby's cubicle] Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. [turns around and sees Toby] You want to see some really high caliber acting? Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. [walks to the annex] Hey Toby, great to have you back, man. Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again. You're welcome. Missed you. Missed you as part of our family. So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun? That must have been fun. Nice beaches, pristine beaches? Why'd you come back? Why didn't you stay? I bet, for you. [shifting uncomfortably and sweating] Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself. Are you happy you did? Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch. Come on! Come oooon... Are you really not going to punch him? Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator. Sir, can you step away from your desk please? Sir, please step away from your desk. They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission. Uh, you know what? I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding. Sir? Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson. Sir, did you recently return from a trip to Central America? No, no no no... No, no. Oh God! Turn around. Do you have any w*apon? You must feel pretty good about yourself right now. Hmm. Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere. You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us. So... Yes, you did. And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history. Do you want to hear a lie? Alright, so, teams forming. You are the silent k*ller. Go back to the annex. Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party. I got it on a website, that's not important. Really? [whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned? We're party girls. [shouting excitedly over the phone] Daddy, daddy, daddy!! No, No, No. No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it. Yo. Oh, that's my last one. Thanks man. Not my problem. All right man, don't cry. It's cool. I'll let you get it for $400. You can owe me. I know, right. Merry Christmas. Something wrong with the doll? You don't have to kiss his ass anymore. Yeah! Would someone just make the copy? The man is wearing sandals. I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work. Gross! I mean he looks like he just got off the boat. Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby? So trained to deal with a hysterical woman. I don't want to look at his feet. [storms off] Do your job! I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change. No. Mmm. About what? What? What's wrong with my outfit? You don't understand clothing, Toby. You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki. Listen up, Flenderson. You're being weak and ineffectual. I'm cowboying this meeting, okay? Here are the new rules. Earth tones only. Also, women are forbidden to wear pants. No. That's debatable. Ooh, where has this guy been? You're running from the problem. It's true! Oh yeah, with Bernie and Efrem. That was hilarious. [to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog? I was rushing to fill an order. I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf. Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me. I'm talking about... hmmm. So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying. Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People don't just fall off of ladders. Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake? [imitating Darryl] Y'all having birthday cake? Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes? It just doesn't add up. Yes, definitely. Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched. I have been my whole life. I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house. Yeah. Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime. Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming. Here, get down! He's not using crutches! Get the camera! Oh, worker's comp, my ass! Toby... Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans] Oh man! You okay? I need to see your pupils. I need to see if they're dilated. Are you... are you serious? Be... cause you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this? Michael, I really don't know what's going on [police sirens in background] down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit. Wait! They're using the lift as their own personal elevator. Really? Then why is there new wood only on one railing? Hmmm? We should check the security tapes Toby. Yes! Phhhht. No judge is gonna believe that... Ahhh, kay. Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives. That's rude. Toby. I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour. [looks over and sees hole in his present] Crap. [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up] Come here you. The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. "Mental" is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it. Get out. Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between "sane and others." Toby has ment*lly checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The "coalition for reason" is extremely weak. Oh my God. Not now, Toby, my God! Get the hell out of here, idiot. [walks into Toby's office] Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute? Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry. Can I sit down for a second? This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation. She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here. Really? Would you do that? [hugs Toby, who smiles big] You're a good, good guy. I'm good... You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends. Sure, what's up? No... that's... You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving. Come on, man! Oh... Right. Okay. [stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot. Okay. [punches Toby's hand] Wow! Behold! [extends his arms] Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas. [Angela claps] Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget. Oh the Anti-Christ! Oh but I can push dr*gs in here? Is that what you're saying? [singing] My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's b*ating... Yeah! That was the idea. Awesome! He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question? Ignore him. He's the local lunatic. Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits] Um, are there any outstanding liability issues to be aware of? Well, safety issues, injuries that could leave the company open to potential lawsuits. So, the staff? Are people generally happy? In what way? So... generally? Generally. What about non-safety issues, in terms of liability? Sexual harassment. Anything like that? You, you don't know. You're the head of Human Resources. Ok. [clip montage] Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin'? Whatcha guys talkin' about? Stuff. I love stuff. Oh, time and resources. This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive. [to Toby] Right? Would you agree with that? [in line to fill up water bottle behind Kevin and Toby] Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach? What? Come on, Stanley! Okay. We're going now! I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush. Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you - You are throwing up for the wrong reasons! [answers phone] Hey Toby. Very interesting.  Pfffffttt. You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this? You line them all up, you take one b*llet, sh**t them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. [stands up and points to Phyllis] Phyllis, you're h*tler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together. Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay. Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was. And we didn't find anything on your computer. Except this. [hands stack of paper to Toby] I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I'm just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid? The way I look at it, there's only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn't know herself, or he wants to use her services to mop up after a m*rder. Oh... yes. [sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.
