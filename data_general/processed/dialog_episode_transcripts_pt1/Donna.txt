No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge. Hi Donna. It's Michael. I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me. I can't even say it. H-I... No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right? Does your stupid husband have it?
