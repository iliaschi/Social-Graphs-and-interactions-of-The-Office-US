Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her!Sweeney That monster of a judge has locked her-[cell phone chiming]. Locked her away. [phone continues ringing]Sweeney How is that funny?Sweeney Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He's gone to sleep now, I've closed his beak. [Michael laughs]Sweeney [text message chime] You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by k*lling it. I've k*lled it! I'm a m*rder! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a m*rder. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But...Sweeney A madhouse.Sweeney Yes, a madhouse.Sweeney Do you think... [bottle rolling] so you think... [bottle rolling, clanking]Sweeney Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it's dried. I've already eaten, like, 30 apricots.Sweeney Hey!Sweeney Silent. Look, congratulations.Sweeney Yeah, good job. Well done.Sweeney Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of em.Sweeney Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy k*ll a bunch of people. Good work.Sweeney Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just... Still not seeing the problem here. You must be Todd. [laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let's get started. [to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves. What!? So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. [Jim looks appalled] I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael. No it is not. [Grunting as he crawls under Dwight's desk. Dwight follows] Let's look at this. No! Sorry Andy. So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter. Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book! I do know how to read though! [getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex] Yeah. [walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate. Drink it! [Andy is seen clicking random things and warning boxes pop up. He pours coffee on his keyboard, puts bologna with mustard in his CD drive, and many other computer harming things] Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? [mock baby voice] Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer. [computer voice] Why are you doing this to me Andy? [normal voice again] Because I hate your programs! And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. [Hank looks irritated again] I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin. I guess you said something weird about your daughter? You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls. No it isn't. Yeah, a little bit. Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines. Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one. Let's not go crazy. [using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight] Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic! All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it] Yes, about that. Well... I don't know if that's a good idea. No, nothing like that at all. Sorry? [thinks a moment] Sounds great. Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots. It doesn't include headshots.
