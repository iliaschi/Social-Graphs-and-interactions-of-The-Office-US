It's the world's only international sport! [sits down] No this is Holly. No this is Holly. Busted. So what can I do for you Holly. Oh really? Was anyone k*lled? Any nuns? [still on phone with Holly] Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn't been transferred? We would have twins. [Dwight points towards the corner of his lip, indicating Michael's "herpes"] Mmhmm! Mhhmm! We would be married. Do what? I don't romanticize th- [Dwight nodding and mouthing 'Yes you do'] No... He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation. We were more than we were. Ok, alright I gotta go. I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right? Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] "How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight." Hello. Hello. [imitating her accent] Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard. [as Curly] Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh? Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! [as Homer] D'oh! Hi. Hi. Oh... [they hug] Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! [both sigh] Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly. Did you bring us anything from Nashua? That's adorable. To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone? Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party. Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. [in a stereotyped Mexican accent] I show you to your desk. Aww... This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it? Oh... Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! [the both chuckle] Oh, I love toy... Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character? You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom. Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie. You're kidding me. Ahh! What a douche bag! Get a... yeah! Good riddance. Mmhmm. Good for him. Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house? Oh, you do? [fighting back tears] Yeah, Randy Newman's the best. So is it an open relationship? Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids? I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it! Wow, an ultimatum. Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy. With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing. I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab." Yeah... Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh? All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings. No, fake girlfriends are always wrong. When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I can't do this." But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me. [blocks Holly's path] No. Was I supposed to bring you guys something? Surprise. I wanted to see you. How are you? Oh, God, you look great. Is everyone here kind of mean? Oh. Hey, what happened to Woody? He smells awful. [whispering] Come on! Oh my God! That's it! That's it! Yes, I told everyone. Hello! Oh, somebody's got a new phone! That is neat. [imitating E.T.] E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone? [imitating E.T.] Why? [imitating E.T.] Bummer. [imitating E.T.] Reese's Pieces. I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible. [slams phone on desk, phone breaks] Want some company? I went to Portugal. So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ? You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present? [imitating E.T.] Holly Flax. [imitating E.T.] Not Michael, E.T. Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there. My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully. We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine... You know what might be kind of fun? I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and... [as Mikanos] If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos? Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today. Well... [as Mikanos] Practice Olympics. [as Mikanos] I like the musical "Grease", or as we call it, "home". It... [laughs] I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk! No more brain damage! Ahh! Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my b*lls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em. [as Mikanos] Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on. Just a minute. How long do we have to wait? You broke up with AJ weeks ago. I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now? Sure we do. Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody. Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree. Yes I do. Yes I do. Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good. [to cameras] Nope, get away. No, that's enough. Ok. Yeah. You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go? Yeah, he just left. Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way. No word from Michael. Hey! What are you doing? Sure thing. Here you go, Miss... Okay, Fanny Smellmore. Real original. Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly? You knew. Where did he go, Holly? Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, "this way, this way"? Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you! Not you, Erin. That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next. Right. I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination. Maybe he's bowling. Hi. [laughs] How did you know I was up here? I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin. Yeah. [laughs] Wow. I just miss you so much. Really? Can I kiss you? Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene. Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me. Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye. Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly's back] Oh, yeah. A little lower. Maybe you find your own chair. Right. Okay. Ah, the old "leave behind." Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working. Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt. Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop. Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day. I love you. I love you-love you. I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly's hand] Hello, Holly. Here, shake. No! No, we can't. No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you. Oh. Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh. Grab you here. You have to cut it out. Never. You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling. Yes, it was that. It's that one. Yes. Number three. We're not supposed to PDA. I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua. That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different? I was in love with you. Holly. Hey. Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up. Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow. You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's... Who? Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu. What are our plans for tonight? Umm... Thanks mom. Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom. It's got a lot of me. [to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that? Hey. Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great! Did you? What did you love about it? No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly. Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded. [angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream. I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus. Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing. I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie. Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you. Hey... It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly. Hi. [Holly and Michael kiss] [shaking Holly's hand] Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston! Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five sh*ts. And it also helps if you've had five sh*ts. [peering into conference room] Don't know, don't care. [seething] Holly, you approved this? You did approve it? [in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this? [walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um... Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer? He's seriously awful! United front... [seems unsure] Everything... Everything. Well, I mean he humped Michael. [giggling] Mean but good! I don't know, I love her and all, but she turned into a b*tch. Mostly she's great, but some days she acts like her mom. [Holly is un-amused] Best day ever. Best day ever! Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head? Please. Yeah, You love him right? [Holly seems unsure] You love him. I can tell. No. Not me, him. [looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself. Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey... He's funnier than me. [very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other! [seems taken aback] Uhm... That's insane! That is. [Jim sees them and looks happy] It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there. Nah, he's an ass. [imitating] You ahh. No you ahh. I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless. 500. That is how you do it. You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price. In case... in case of what? I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case? Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try. Your friend Michael, yes. What's going on? Holly? There was a program on TV about India. Wanna watch it? What are you doing there? I'll, I'll put your mother on. Holly? Don't you worry about him, he's got me. I have your father. He's right here I'll put him on. My mom also makes the best salsa. Yeah mostly. It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was. Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested. Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.' Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything. Oh ok. For how long? Is he alright? You ok? Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that. Ok. No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope. Hey, how'd we do? That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good. No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that. So this is one of my favorite places in the world. This is where we first kissed. And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there? Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes. Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness? We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump. And over here.. Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [runs water through hand] Let's go in here. Holly, will you marry me? Marry me Holly. Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Will you marry me Holly? [the area where Holly's desk is is filled with lit candles] This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. [f*re sprinklers go on] Holly Flax, marrying me will you be? [crying] I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. [picks World's Best Boss mug out of the trashcan and puts it back on his desk] I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come. [dials on his phone] Hi. What is the name of our town? No, no. I just needed to hear your voice. [laughing] Yes. [Olive Oyl impression] Yes my hero! [laughing] Ohh, I miss you. Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
