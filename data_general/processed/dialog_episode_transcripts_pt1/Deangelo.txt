Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years. Oh, really? And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms. Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday. I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado. Yep. Don't mess with Colorado. No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo. You know, I would like to try the luge, through. That's what I've heard. [in unison] Summer! [holds out fist] Knuckles! Actually, I gotta come around and give you... Really? What happened? Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are. Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry. [calls Deangelo, Deangelo's phone vibrates] No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar. You are? What bar? I... do not see you. I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour. What're you wearing? Are we both at the right place? I hear your voice. I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! [holds out hand] Michael Scott. Wow... that is insane! [laughter] [entering Dunder Mifflin offices] Here we go! Are you ready? This is it. What do you think? Oh, she'll do. She'll do just fine. [pops up from below camera, and runs out of room] Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers! Come on out! I am well, sir, how are you? [drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know... Oh, hi! [obviously flirting body language] Have we met before? Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you. I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy! Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what... That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up 'Hello, my name is..,'] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself. Cecelia. That apple looks delic! I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems. Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics? Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would h*t it off. He's a great person to know. Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you. Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend. Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it! I sorta like the old way. I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just- Yeah, ok, good. What do you think? [picks up phone] ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up] Deangelo, did you order a barber? Yeah, real cool. Real power move. [to Erin] Shave me. [walks into office with Deangelo] This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies! And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go. [Erin puts too much shaving cream on Michael's face, none on the neck] You wanted to talk to us Deangelo? Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do... [Erin shaves Michael] god... we sorta do more of like powwows or- And what happens here is- We were... I think she was just trying to- Don't shave my lips. ...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock. [leans on table] I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy] Yeah, right, I mean- [walks into door, jokingly] [pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you. Need a hand? So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh? No, I'm good. Keep them. [mimes using a rope to pull himself forward to microwave] Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here... [throws tea packets into air, puts hand in unplugged toaster, pretends to be shocked, takes container of cheese-puffs and throws them into air, pours hot coffee on his pants] [drinks hand soap] ...I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations. Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy. What? Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything? Oscar, here you go. [throws sandwitch] No one had a problem with the air here until you came around. Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room. I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine. Ok. [hugs Deangelo from behind] Why did you have to be so damn good? No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it. Guess I've been working so hard I forgot what it's like to be hardly working. Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece? We're back in! Right? Seriously? Stone cold seriously. They are trying to figure me out. And I don't like it. Once they figure me out, they start to tell me what I want to hear. And I need to quickly figure out who's a good worker and who is simply a good mind reader. Because as soon as I'm hearing what I want to hear, I'm not gonna care. Thanks. These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them? This all sounds great to me. [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad. I don't know what to think. That is a s-- astute observation, Kevin. Kev's got me pegged. [chuckles] Good morning, Deangelo. Okay. Because of the flowers. Dogwoods, or just the Earth. Hey, well, good morning. I think I have good news for you today. I found your new executive assistant. My friend Carla. [looking at resume] She's got great experience. We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume. Okay. Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle. I also say that because I am also in the inner circle. Did you get that, Ma? Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle! [thinks] Which doesn't exist. Oh, wow, thank you. That was so kind of you. [throws cup in the garbage] It's just that I own the coffee shop. So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun. I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there. No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. It reminds me of my relationship with my son. Except there, I'm the Dwight. Yes! Yeah, I say we just go for it! That's Toys R Us, I think. [holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally. Jim, you got ripped off big time. Yes. Deangelo's open! Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure. Sure thing, Mr. Howard. [whispers to Kelly] You're the best. Thank you. Congratulations on your one cousin. I have seventy. Each one better than the last. I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here. Okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it. Okay? What? No you're not. No. No. No. No. No. No. under "Special Skills," Mr. Don Feiner put "Juggling." [laughter] Seriously? 320. Just freeballin' it. Give or take. [Deangelo walks out] I gotcha covered, boss. Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out b*lls] Got some extra b*lls! [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them] Hey-hey-hey-ho! Oh wow, you weren't kidding. [raises hand] Here. Yeah. Okay. Hey, you got a second? Yeah, I got tons of time. This job's a joke. [opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in. We meeting? If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over -- I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand] Just the guys. Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem. I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads. Uh, some of the female department heads. Whoa. Whoa. Wait. That sounds like Pam. You know how she gets. Deangelo, she can get really bitchy. [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin... That's awesome. All the time. Hey, who'd you end up hiring? I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't. What's the argument here? NBA, WNBA. One is a sport, one is a joke. I love sports, I love jokes. Room for all. Yeah. Wow. [to Jim] Just go in. Just go in, he probably forgot to text you. [to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest. Yeah. Hey! Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck! Okay? We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all. I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money. I can't do this. I can't do this. I'm sorry. I just can't do it. Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss. Okay? Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years. No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo. He's like Rango. He doesn't work here, basically. Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals. It was just a big misunderstanding. I did not see Rango. He's not saying anything! Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself. [laughs] Total brain burp. Okay, well it's just really loud. Do it! You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? I'd love to see that dunk of yours. Today. Now, maybe. 'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it. Why not? Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop. Alright, there you go. 15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in? Okay. Seriously? I don't, I don't think I can do that. I'm holding your jewelry. Yes! Okay. [sits down in front of basket] No. No thank you. Fantastic. Yup. [Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo? Erin.
