Ok. Ahh...We don't really do those. We just sign the thing. Hey. Monday's suck. Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back. This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009. Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab? [to Val] Hey. You're welcome. So, tonight I was thinking, I'm gonna go to the cemetery. I'm gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you'd like to come with me. Yes, I am. I could quit. Problem solved. Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point. [to Val] Hey, you caught some of that? What, you don't like the blues? Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts] This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution. Alright. Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about. Popsicles? You had me at "clookies." I can't wait to find out what they are. I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster. I thought you'd wear a sweater. Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you. You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess. Val. You made it. Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that? You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-A*DS. This thing is choice. [to Andy] Come on. Let's chicken fight those two. Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking. Cool. No! Val, I need the space. Everybody out. I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do. [clears throat] Notice anything different about me? [noticing all the warehouse workers wearing homemade beanies] Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here. Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry. I get too excited. [opens gift] Darryl. They're so elegant. Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way. Thanks. [to Val] Nice flowers. Your mom? Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman? She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon? Processed. Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf! I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend. Don't play dumb with me. I know what's up. I read the text you sent to Val, man. See? Yes. Thank you, sister. It has been processed. I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion... Sure. That's some pretty blatant complementing you're doing there, man. I don't even talk to her like that. Sounds like you're trying to h*t on my girlfriend. [scoffs] So you really think she's gonna leave a guy who owns his own restaurant for a dude who ate his own restaurant? [taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val] Love you too. Bye. Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so... I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it. Let's talk pubes, people. I feel it working. [Erin and Pete playing around with the mayo] Eiffel tower! Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl. He's a real catch and you should take him back. No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you k*ll it? Is it because in some strange way it is you? So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back? Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever. I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time. [as the baler crushes the bubble wrap, making loud noises] Huh? Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do. Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps. Good luck. Good evening. Yeah, come on, Tobes. Good luck. Good evening. Yeah, come on, Tobes.
