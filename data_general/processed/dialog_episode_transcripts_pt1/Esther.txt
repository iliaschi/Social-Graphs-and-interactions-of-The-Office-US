I see Esther's back in town. Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today. Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always. By hand. I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther. No. That snake! That shady grove out by Willard's pond. So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed? Post hole digging. [points and laughs with Esther] Oh, Esther. What are you- [Esther kisses him] You're here early. Yes! Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything. In a way. But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song. [fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles] Yes. Irritating, also yes. But I gotta hand it to him, he's one of the most tenacious and determined men I've ever met. [Dwight finishes his routines and everyone applauds] Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services. Oh. Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip] [puts his grandmother's ring away] Thank you, Esther.
