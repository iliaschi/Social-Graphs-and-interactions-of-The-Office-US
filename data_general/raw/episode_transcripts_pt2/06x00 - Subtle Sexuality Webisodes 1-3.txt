People are gonna flip out when they hear our new song and they hear our group's new name.Erin: Oh. Did we come up with a new name?Kelly: We did. Subtle Sexuality.Erin: Cool.Kelly: [putting make-up on Ryan] You know when you love a guy and he's giving you mixed signals but you know he really likes you and you're sleeping together?Ryan: More eyeliner.Kelly: I'll never tell who this song is about. That is a secret that I will take to the grave.Ryan: It's about me.Kelly: It is, but I'll never say.Ryan: Yeah. This looks ok.Oscar: [who has been sitting at the table all along eating his lunch] Do you guys need to do this here? This is a public area.Kelly: It's our office, too, Oscar. [to Ryan] I think you might have too much rouge.Ryan: No. It's not gonna read on camera unless there's a lot.Kelly: How do you know so much about what's gonna read on camera?Ryan: Uh... I lived in New York for eleven months. [Kelly nods in agreement]Ryan: What can I say? I love music. If I had to choose a lifetime without music or without sex, I would go a lifetime without sex. Girls would find other ways to take care of me.Kelly: In this sh*t I'm a bride, but I'm also kind of a tough girl, so I'm gonna be smoking a cigarette.Erin: And I'm the minister.Kelly: Ok, Erin. Just sh**t it. After I puff on the cigarette, I'm gonna put it out on my high heel 'cause that's what they do in music videos.Ryan: Are we doing this or not?Kelly: Yes! We're still setting up!Ryan: My blood-sugar is getting low!Kelly: Well, you know what? You should have had the end of the soy yogurt that I offered you.Erin: Rolling? [Kelly inhales the cigarette, chokes and spits]Kelly: Cut. Cut.Ryan: That's it. I'm done.Kelly: We still have to sh**t our make out scene!Ryan: I've got somewhere to be.Kelly: Ugh! We're finished!Erin: Is that a wrap?Kelly: He and I are finished. The show must go on.Erin: Absolutely.Kelly: I have to throw up.Erin: Good.[ Subtle Sexuality, Webisode 02 - "The Replacement" ]Erin: The sh**t was going really great... until Kelly and Ryan got into a fight. Then the poop really h*t the fan.Erin: Maybe you can do it alone?Kelly: I don't think so.Kevin: Kelly, I heard that you were looking for someone to replace Ryan.Erin: Do you know someone?Kevin: I thought that I could do it.Kelly: This isn't radio, though. You know there's a visual component to what we're doing.Kevin: Yeah?Erin: Would you be able to kiss him?Kelly: [sighs] We would love it if you'd hold the camera for us.Kevin: I would very much like to do that.Erin: Oh. No. You have to wipe the jelly off your hands first. Sticky. [all turn when they hear Andy singing in the break room]Andy: [singing to the tune of Beethoven's 5th] Vending machine. Vending machine. I want a treat. Something to eat. I want a treat. A little sweet. But not too sweet. What do I eat? Vending machine. Tell me what to eat now.Andy: So they asked me to audition for Subtle Sexuality so I gave them a little [makes electric guitar sounds]. Followed by some [scatting]. And, I sealed the deal with [old school rap beats].Kelly: [teaching Andy & Erin choreography] One and two and cross and cross. Down. Sexy, sexy, sexy. You guys got that?Ryan: Hey, uh, some of us are trying to work out there. What's he doing here?Erin: He's your replacement.Ryan: This guy? You're really gonna make out with this guy?Kelly: Ryan, this video is bigger than you or me.Ryan: You really think you can replicate the chemistry that you and I have... with this guy?Andy: We've met before...Kelly: I'll be thinking about you the entire time.
