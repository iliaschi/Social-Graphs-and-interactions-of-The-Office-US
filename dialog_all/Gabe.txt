A prop Kn*fe actually costs ten times more than a real Kn*fe and we have lots of knives, so... Well Gabe, I looked through the handbook and it doesn't say anything about not being allowed to make horror movies in the office. [grunting, wielding axe] [screaming] Run! Oh yeah. It's unprofessional for you. But for me, making films is my profession. Whoa. Wait. Stop right there. Your voice, just now. It sounded really resonant and commanding. I have an idea that is so nuts... I feel like we kinda have to do it. Would you consider doing voiceover work on my film? Yeah. Quit playing hard to get, Gabe. You know you have a great voice. Awesome. I'll direct. I'll produce. I'll act. I'll write the score. I'll be the first to wear all four hats. mmm I guess so. But does he also play his own soundtrack? [picks up saxophone and plays three notes] Let's make a movie guys, huuh! Huuh.[ The Third Floor, Webisode 03 - "The Final Product" ] [screams] Whack! Oh God. Come on! Come on! Come on! [screams] Who's the guy who invented the peanut? Hey! Not at all. I'm gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao. [he and Erin kiss] Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe? Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you. Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him. [Dwight starts aggressively spanking Andy] Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop! That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery. I can do that. Is there another option? Hey, do you have a second? Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over. And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you. I just think somebody lost the paperwork. There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone. Yes. He seems fine. Easily. But of course! Great. So weird that there is no paperwork. Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America. Admit what? Say it. Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe. Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle. Sure. Anything else? I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith. How is that relevant to anything? The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no. I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no. Lake Erie. So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road? Has anyone started calling you "Gabe-wad" yet? Gabe-wad. Mmhm! [bleep] you, Gabe! Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me. You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas. Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years. Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it. I don't understand the point of a hat. I am not budging on the hat issue. Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe. No, I'm not. I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going. I agree. I think it's superb. Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this. All right! [tossing pizza dough in the air] Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you. [throws pizza dough, hits the ceiling] You play? [referring to keyboard] Where's Michael? Where's Michael? We can't start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin! [turning up volume] Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! [takes remote, raises volume] There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord! Well some of us are trying to have a... [grabs different remote from the table] Well I will turn up the volume. Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find. Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust? What's the longest thing you've ever seen? [Michael chuckles] For me it was the tale from Jets. You know what Erin you do have to. What? Really? That stinks! I hate it! I hate your car! Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl's gonna turn my hair gray. I accidentally ate some seahorses. I didn't know it's powdered, so like four or five, I don't know. Dunh-duh-na-dah! A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right? Nope. Okay. How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? [Jim reaching his arms out as far as he can go] Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? [Jim inhales] Good. We're working. [Jim still holding his breath] [puts his phone in his coffee mug and calls Gabe] Now listen here, Gabe, you're too fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat. I made some changes to my book. See if you like them. I will not work in a roach billboard. It's present time, you guys. [all react] Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre. I said, "I wonder." I didn't say, "I think." Blankets, what am I, five? Erin and I make great use of ours. Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party. Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans. Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre. [tosses Erin a Frisbee] Hey! Gabe. [clapping] Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour. When I win... We're gonna watch "Wall-e", where all the boundaries of color are pushed. What? Come on. It's time for grapes. [regular voice] Real fun day. I know. You get to pick. Yes? Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow. Boo-yea! [office laughs] "I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again." Yes! Why? Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game. Irony is such a critical... Wow. Wrap it up, Gabe. Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, let's all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre. Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. [laughs] Not every day. He's heading downtown. Guess not. You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people. [notification tone] [laughter] Phyllis! Oooohhh. Nice! Do the next one. Dreaming he's a dog on a island. Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it? That's tasteless, Gabe. Tasteless. Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading. Maybe it wasn't. No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going. [laughs] Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you. From my secret admirer. That's you! Come on. "Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue." Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt! But, there's no clue. I can't, 'cause there's no clue. Ha! I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes sex. He can put both his legs behind his head. [clears throat] [sitting in Holly's lap] Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting? Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on. OOH! Boom! Face! Yeah. What? Us? Love it. Keep it goin. Booby honking. Butt honking. The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap... Yeah! I will grab you here anyway. [laughs] I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained. No, I don't think so. [walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower. That marriage would be a sham. How do I become a manger at Sabre? I left a message at corporate. Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file? From when he recommended me to replace him. Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up. I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me. Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so... Tomorrow I will be a wreck. Hey! Why don't you, uh, stay away from me? Okay! That's so weird! Just go away! Let's rip it up homes. [smacks top of the door frame with his hand, leaving a chocolate hand outline] [walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe! I really think you should leave. Can we talk about this later, I have to go. Gabe! [Gabe is still standing in front of Michael's desk] And you, why are you still here. No, that's definitely a knockoff. You can feel the center of gravity's off. Feel that. [throws ball to Gabe] What do you think? Oh yeah. I'd do it for you here, but uh, what would you say this room is, 300 square feet? 320? Oh, I think it's 18 hundo. Oh. Like nobody. It was -- [knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey! It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly? [chuckles] Oh, you mean Michael Jordan? [lots of gibberish] says to bartender [lots more gibberish] Droswip. Droswip. I know, right? Yeah? Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe] What? No, this is horrifying. We're just friends, okay? Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now? 00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call] He's just gonna call back. [quietly] What? Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages. [buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall. I'll go with you. [excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the g*n v*olence forms before. She had so much - Hey. No! [Erin and Andy laugh] Uh... Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying... You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty? Well, I mean, I can't just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then you'll get the plan. [speaking faster] Well, I'm not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. You're in paper, right? Yes. Do I look like someone who would waste my own time? So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up] For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... [gets cut off by Gabe] I wasn't acc-, accusing... I didn't think you were. I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office! What? Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows? Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,... Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage. What was that? [getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate? Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title. Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can f*re the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person... [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye! Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how. You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee! [walks in with her dogs] Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this. [gives the dog leashes and multiple bags to Gabe] No, send him in. [to Search Committee] Who is this? [looks astonished] Ohhhh! Who's this fella? Went to Cornell. What's wrong with him? And that's your unbiased opinion. So it's not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you? Gabe...ugh... you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let's get you back to Florida. We'll figure out something for you. She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate. Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you. You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh. I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be! Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California? Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California! [everyone toasts] Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California. You people say I led you, but it wasn't me. You want to toast the man who led you to success, but the boss is irrelevant. Andy and I, we produce nothing. We do nothing. We sit in our offices and demand, I want this and that right now, like petulant children. You know, the difference between a crying baby and a manager, one day the baby will grow up. But, without you, Andy and I would be sitting in our dirty diapers, waiting for someone to change us, wipe us. I should be toasting you, thanking you, for allowing me to have the easiest job in the universe. Cheers. Well, Toby and I did, yeah. Gabe? I'm throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little. I think it could use some extra pizazz. Remember that Halloween party you took me to once? The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn't stop crying? No – just scary. If we wanted ideas for scary stuff. What are you thinking? [in ghostly voice] Oookayyy everybody. Be prepared to be scared. Ok. [hits play on DVD player, "Do yes disturb meditations of horror" appears on screen, Gabe winks at Erin, on screen food deflates, a mouse crawls across a photograph of a woman, a person brushes very dirty teeth] There is no story. I'll be there. Hey. Mmhmmm. For you? Who are you seeing? That's gr... Oh. You know I don't have to do the paperwork unless you're actually dating. But I mean...uh have you talked to her? Is sh... Do you know her last name, yet? She's going to be screaming her own last name? Who knows what the belt is for? All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays. Look at this, this is enormous. I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that's the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard. [Gestures milking a cow] You done? Once you read the packet, sign the back. Yeah, sure. Mmhmm. [points at gabe] Caramel soy latte. That's what I'm sayin'. Thanks for the coffee. Are you asking me on a date? Because I don't date coworkers. It's not personal, it's a matter of policy. So word on the street is she has a boyfriend. Yeah you have this sexy glow. Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay. [whispers to Jim] I'm gonna do it. All right! We're here. Limitless can wait. [taps Gabe's shoulder] Are you Lincoln? No, no, I'm- Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture. Hey! Lincoln's starting. [light applause] Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy. [voiceover the three walking] The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that's good because I was basically wrong. I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general. But I guess it's really more like they're just people who work in an office and I'm their manager. Yeah that's really probably a better analogy now that I think about it. Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl! Looks that way. Ooh. I'm glad you're on our team. Here, please have a seat. Gabe? You don't know? Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office. We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this. Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy. Meat grinder. No, he's going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I don't want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He's a great person to know. I'll dialogue with him tonight. [leaves] Still an important position. Still a chief. Gabe, listen to me. Don't bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a f*re on the home front. Just wait twenty minutes and then I want you to listen to Dwight's pitch. Make him feel valued. Make him feel heard. Okay, time's up. Let's get the boards up. "Atlanta, Georgia" is the correct answer. [Kevin holds up "What is...SEE-attle"] [sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here. This must be very frustrating. Oh my God. Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling? What's with the smile? And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us. Take me to Robert. Take me to his house. You know where it is. Lead me there. Which one is it? Grab my knee! It's almost too warm. Oh, so close. Eighty-one. Oh. With amm*nit*on like this we are in for quite a night, you and me. I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema. Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man. Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave. Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom. We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit. Oh, I am so in. That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves] Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe. Thank you- That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback. Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no... Freak, I need a favor. I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie. You really want Packer as your boss? Oh! How did that look? Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left. Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face] Fascinating. Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs] Ugh. No, that's absolutely the case.  Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don't you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah. Oh, I bet you think it's all about core, huh? Oh, please. Feast on this, Lewis. Come on, Gabe, you can't handle his hamstrings. You're getting hypno-thigh-zed. You're welcome. Eight, nine, ten. Very funny Jim. I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk. Did someone say girl talk? Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk. Do you think I'd like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish? Great, yeah, good. That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest. Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man. Didn't you two used to do it? No. So Andy just called you up out of the blue? Yeah. Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day? Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item? Gabe! We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you? Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican. I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you! Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's- Oh my god. Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe. No! He is not a very sophisticated man, I mean he can't even use chopsticks, so. Do I need to say anything else? Gabe, I don't- What is that supposed to mean? I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man. [Erin and Gabe argue in background] "This isn't really going that well" Okay. [starts round of applause] You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok? Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So... We have a little song prepared for you. Wow. Really terrific. No. Don't like that. Talk about vacation days! Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff? Mm, nope. Don't like that. We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right? They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day. I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us. Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em. All of them. So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups? The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing. Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now. Wait a minute, who is it? Who's there? Is there somebody in the room with you? [Michael gesturing "no"] I want to see who it is. Turn me around. [Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello! I like that. Good-looking group. Another couple of heartbreakers. Who is this tall drink of sun tea? [gesturing to Michael] I thought this guy was the manager? Yeah. Take Jim's old office. How late do we have to work tonight? Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is? We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael! Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for m*rder someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around k*lling people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone. They act like I have no power. Thank you. Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that. Exactly that. Exactly that. [again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level... Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice. I'm not crying. [on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth] The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure. Yeah. Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. "Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall." "Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies." Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave] [imitating Cookie Monster] "Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful." I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work. Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making. Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek] [Gabe walks in] Thanks Toby. [gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize. [gets on one knee] I kneel before you. Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition. I didn't see that movie. Do they still get paid? Pathetic. What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression? [imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person. "Ciao" Right? "Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee." Okay, I have more of them. What is this? How do I apply? Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going? Come here. Come here. Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking? Kelly is disqualified! You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America. Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic. Kelly is the only applicant. Hello. Sometimes my bangs cover it. You don't know what you need. Just... Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette. Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right. Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important. Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on f*re. What are we gonna do about this? [calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay. Whatever. I'm the one blending in. Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe. Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag. So embarrassing. We will be well-rested tomorrow. Excellent. Go for it. What? I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you. It wasn't me. What? Based on what? Hey guys, uh, sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone. Through Teach for America, I'm going to go down to Detroit and teach, uh, inner city kids about computers.
