Beauty approaches; I am brought under its spell; I long to be with. Then I ran out of syllables. It's not like they have anything else to do, okay? They're old â€“ their bingo cards aren't going anywhere. fifty ancient zombies, traipsing through the pot-hole-ridden streets of Scranton, out for blood. Sounds scary, right? Too bad you'll never see it because the idiot manager at the Evergreen old folks home thinks it sounds [air quotes] exploitative. So, that's where we're at right now. What's going on? Well... we could be in it. You could use us. Ryan, lots of directors use their girlfriends. Ryan, look, you know I can scream. I scream at you all the time and then you could sh**t in this office for free. [screams] I'm so sorry Angela. Is that even a fake Kn*fe? I know you want to make your movie, but you can not scare people in the office. You can not sneak up on people wielding w*apon anymore. It's petrifying and frankly, it's unprofessional. Look, I don't want to have to thr*aten you, but you have to stop this production or I will... Really? I would love to. Um, well, Clint Eastwood already does all that. We're on the second floor. Why are these m*rder happening? [to Toby, who's filming] You fallin' behind. Ryan, we're doing the dance! [Bluetooth rings] You got Creed. All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks! Wait. Less matching to appear more rich? I thought they were kind of cute. [looking outside through the window] I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets... I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics. Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now. Don't let us down. [leans hobo sack against the refrigerator] It's a great stick, right? No. So. You're all on the list! Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer. Okay. You wanna know? I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you. If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can b*at me. And a top of the day to you too, sir. You may have seen the bus out front. Today we also say good-bye to our young adult ministry. They're leaving for three months to build a school for the village of Quimixto, in Cabo Corrientes, Mexico. Okay, "A," Halbert. And, "B," I think a more appropriate statement would be, "The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests." Good morning. Excuse me, everyone, on behalf of the youth ministry that's leaving for Mexico, I just wanted to thank our hosts and tell you about those good-looking guys and gals over there. [group of young adults cheer and applaud] Well, it's, it's- You have a g*n in your desk? No what? The show's back on, what happened? Morning. How's It Going? [wearing Ryan's glasses] I'm Facebook. I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back. A what? Dot com! I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience. I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop. Your kidding?! You and me. Don't you work here full-time? Mm-Hmm. That does sound fun to me. Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan. Whoo! Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space. Really?! Who?! At least. Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with sh**t or gas leaks? That's right! What's your money situation? Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion? Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days. Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen? You have his email? Ryan, just tell us your plan. Dwight? Here we go. "It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!" "He's up there." Look, this is a marketing campgain. You got nine days. Let's say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it? I said to Ryan, "I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!'" I think I'm gonna stay here. I do, I do. This isn't right. But I--it's not right. Is it any particular branch of Washington University? They only want it for the initials. Get us out of this! I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right? "The moment Darla put the cupcake in her mouth, her daddy pulled her aside and said, "You're Too Fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat." The next time I saw David Geffen was at the buffalo club. "I love you, you Gay Bastard," I said. "You Gay Bastard," I s--. "Gay Ba--" "Gay B--"" Good, good, bro. Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here? Nine days, though. That's, like... Yes, you have tapped this. Hard. Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo. So you would think that's a good idea for me to do? Mm-Hmm. Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so... Tonight? Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check. If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell. Hello. Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody's money. You can't have it. Okay, someone look it up. I'm sitting right here. Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually. That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed. [lights turn off, Pam and Dwight begin to wave their arms to alert the sensor] Pass. Two for two, keep it up. No. Guys, it's a really big deal. [rubs his neck] He's rubbing his neck. So, cool right? Okay. Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right? I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or... No. [Oscar unwraps a pair of Uggs] For your feet! No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read. I'll make it. What are you drinking. I don't know how to make that. This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it? I said no hits! Hey, Ryan. How's your fart project coming? Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant! My resolution was to get more attention. Cake. Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right? I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business. Can you do it? So no? What do I put you down for, bro hombre? All right! Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome. Divorced? We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot. And you didn't invite any of us? God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake. You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married. Ryan, I changed my mind. First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances. Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here. Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey. No, we weren't. Definitely not. That's disgusting. My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago. Well, Michael Scarn was quickly becoming one of the hottest hockey players in the country. It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. Okay, look. We can't f*re someone because we don't like him. What are you referencing? [looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door] This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin. You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there. Free sample? You got this kosher certified? Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs] What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa] Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out? And that is Dallas. [shows money] Not bad right. [swinging golf club] That would be hot. I would pay to see that. I... don't know. Help me. You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here- Oh, their breadsticks are like cr*ck! Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use? Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right? Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. [Ryan stands next to Michael up front] Ryan how are you today? Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, [Ryan stands up] Danny Cordray! [Ryan quickly sits] Danny couldn't be here tonight... You h*t me with your car! [in Ryan's office, which is illuminated blue] She was once my girl, and she is your girl now. Yeah. You're not prone to seizures? Hey Ry. Your department's k*lling it, baby. [puts arm around Ryan] Keep it up. What? Why should I pretend that you are my boss? Yeah, but you lie all the time. You lie for no reason. Ryan, you just like to lie. You really would? Woo. Glad he's not my boss. [on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight. No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time. He won't ever stand us up again. When Deangelo's around. All the time. You chose this job over that job? So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods. And she becomes...The Horse Flyer. Ohh. Is this true, Ryan? That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away] Would you consider this a t*rror1st incident? I just really, really think we should handle this internally. You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant. No. Why would we be talking about the Senator? 'Cause he's totally gay? [walks away] The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to. Are you? [leaves] Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality. Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really- A homeless person. Really? A homeless person. No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person. Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View? [various] Good luck! Goodbye! Good luck at your new job. "Suck it losers." Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it's barely three pounds. Fifty L. Oh. [smiling] Ready! [flips sketch pad showing tattoo possibilities] "I'm not as think as you drunk I am!" [crowd claps and cheers] I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo... I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything? No. Uh, buying lottery tickets online. [Ryan laughs] 30 today, right? Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far. How is that better than a barbecue? No, I'm certain you said basil. I think this thing is broken. She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again! I am so cold. Are you sure? I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh. Ryan, will you please tell her who I am? Hey guys. I'm an Oscar [gestures to face] liar [gestures to nametag saying "Representative Weiner] weiner. Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives. Try mose1234. [his phone vibrates] He stopped it! I'm training a temp to be my replacement while I'm on maternity leave. Oh I should've mentioned I'm pregnant. You probably didn't notice because it's impossible to tell I'm so small. But yeah I'm pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on! Hmm. Doubt it. Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs] You know it's not just pregnant women who don't get their due. You know who's gorgeous? Helen Mirren. Mm-hmm. Not his mom's car. I'm going into labor! Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal? Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese. Well, I was hoping to talk out some ideas with Andy. But what we have here... is perhaps better. By not going on the trip, you've shown you're the free-thinkers of the office. I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let's dig in, shall we? Absolutely. This idea hasn't gripped me. What else did you come up with? Who else agrees with Kevin, that we're wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products when we should be pushing our top-performers? [everyone raises their hand, Robert laughs] There you go. Consensus. [laughing] Kevin! Big Mac idea. That sounds encouraging. Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside. Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac. And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands. I don't know. He wasn't talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn't hire his wife. Well it was really nice to meet you Brian. Oh, Ryan. Now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these sh*ts! Yes! Oh yes. [laughing] Boom! Yes. They totally do. Well help me, OK? Just, uh take... Yes, Shawn Marion. Excuse me, sir, on the Dunder-Mifflin A-team? Excuse me, sir? I'm sure you're just checking your Grindr account... [laughter] but you can't check smart phones during trivia, it's against the rules. Okay, you're not turning it off. Sir? Okay, then we're going to have to take it away. [employee takes the phone] Thank you. I'm feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half. Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau. Too kind doesn't begin to cover it. To both these bears. Caligula, Last Tango in Paris, and Emmanuelle 2. Last two movies I actually watched in here Marley and Me and On Golden [bleep] Pond. To madness. Are you serious? Yes, that's it. Push yourselves, boys. It's not a party if you don't do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going. A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up. No. It's crazy. Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan. Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys! Guys.. Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving. Or both? Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead. But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here? It did, it did. Oh, I like it. No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store. I don't know how I'm going to live here without you. Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you. Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now. Power. Psst. Say, "So who's leading this thing, anyway?" Psst. Say, "I can't wait to meet him." Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader? I'll be on top. It's the most important position. [tries to climb human pyramid] Ahh! You need an operation. You have appendicitis. Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean? Thank you.(Dwight looks on angrily) Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it. A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy? I'm moving down here, you know. I'm young, and I can ... and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young. You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle. Whoa. the lights are still on. I like how guys just know stuff all the time. [gasps] Hello, waffle iron. Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl... ... a measuring cup... [whispers] It's the fuzz! My husband would tell you to go for it. Hey. Hey. A lot of fun. You should move down here with me. We could be roommates. We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl- Maybe in six months- Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a h*t with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine. Yes. Yes. Yes. Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing â€“ bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You're gonna love â€˜em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world's fair. Ryan, you ready to do this? Good! Okay. Flirt away. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous. Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen. I'm trying to make him feel important. Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you're so smart. You're smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee. What's a book? [giggles] [ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan. You're the only one who can do it, s-sweetie. I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one -- Jim, get him a water. It's moments away. Just stay here! How you doing? Oh. Ryan, why didn't you tell me? You never update it. When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel. Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag. Plus everyone would know who you meant. Nobody's named Monday. [Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower. Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby. Don't shake our baby? Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you. Yeah, I'm glad you said something. Me too. Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not. Yeah, they're really great together. Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal. Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share. God I don't even remember what that fight was about. You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link. Andy, Erin, you can join us now. All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly. I don't like you very much. Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better. I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy. Read it, please. I love amazing poetry. Read through the pain. Be strong. Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone. [sees Ryan on the horse] Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo! Hey, hey. Okay. I wasn't going to interrupt. Barf! Ugh, you suck! Turn around. Turn around. Turn around! She don't wanna turn around. Ryan. You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him. I do. I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?  Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter? Smokey, the bear? Wow That's terrible, I really liked him. Well, I second that emotion. I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones? No, no, no, "Tracks of My Tears" and what else? What are some more? What's one more? You don't like the Beatles? Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer? It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago. 250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan. Paul Anka. Okay, you could just show up late though. Tears of a clown! Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good! Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons. Thanks for helping out, sweetie. Hey, Ryan! Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now? No, this little guy is mine. So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals] Drake is your baby's name? That is an amazing name. I'm obsessed with Drake. His last album... it just touched me to pieces. [dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don't owe me anything. Oh, no. Oh, yeah, you're not feeling well little guy? Okay, sure. Should we go inside? Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn't this, like what you live for? Just go. Go. I don't know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn't look so good. Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson's a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It's me. It's me. [laughing] I love you too. We're running off into the sunset. Thanks for helping out, sweetie. Hey, Ryan! Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now? No, this little guy is mine. So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book.

[laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It's me. It's me. [laughing] I love you too. We're running off into the sunset. My lord my liege. So I need a little treat for the g*ng. Something to win their affections back. Well, I ran down Meredith in my car. No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little cr*ck in her pelvis. But she will be up in... Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine. we are fine? [sigh] Right. Let's do some good. [sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back -- There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. [laughing] He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs. Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm.. [rubbing hands in Ryan's hair] f*re! That's right! That's right! Little old man boy. Bearded man boy. Oh, wow! That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way. Woooo![laughs] I think Ryan has a gay crush on me. Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes? Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, "Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you." His words. Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading "Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!"] OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless? Got it. [Andy's hand goes up] We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together? Can we speak privately about our relationship? That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up? And... that is why we waited so long to tell people. Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual? Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no? Good, so, we're on the same page? We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans. Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys. A lot. Black guys mostly. I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want. Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me. And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it. Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby? [to Ryan] Hey. Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan. Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title. Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry. Thank you, thank you. Best decision I ever made. I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty. Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why. Good, we're all here, we can get started. Have a seat. Have a seat. Like everybody else. Thank you everyone. Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door] Good night guys. [staff leaves the office] I disagree, I think it was very valuable. I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it. You know, some place romantic and expensive. I don't understand what the big deal is. No! Right, so? No! Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today. I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back. Fine. Then God speed. To both of us. Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people. The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry] No way! Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do. How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive. Uh totally. Yeah. Thank you. So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo. Thanks. That'd be great. Oh... is it... No... Um... I'm uh, I'm dating Jim. We're together. Yeah, great. OK great! May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now. Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to m*rder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy. I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did. And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie. ... It was two hundred dollars.[ New Scene ] I know. I love it there. Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun. Sounds great. No I'm not. I told you I don't want you doing these things in here. You can use your own office or do it in the hall. Can I start talking? Is this thing on? Give me a signal when you want me to start. Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen b*at your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole. This is Michael. You're breaking up. I can't hear you. Yeah, let's go. Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man! Yes, and thank you for sending that to me. Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up. I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in] Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'? Um... that wasn't much of an introduction. And the best way to start is to h*t start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You h*t register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes. Why? No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that. My other boss, Mr. Figaro. Are you a cocktail waitress? It won't. You're so funny. I invited him. Okay, bye honey. Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it? Huh, okay. It's whoever, not whomever. I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night. How did Ryan use it? As an object? No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull. You have a call from Eddie Murphy. [on speakerphone, Eddie Murphy voice] Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! [laughing] I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry. Okay, calm down. I have a small problem. Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas. I'm creative, Ryan. Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store. Yeah! Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little b*tch again. [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that has a smiley face] Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. [Jan looks impressed] Yep. Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later. N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude. I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist. Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. [To Jan] Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is. Hey hey. I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second. I would love that. Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company. It's ridiculous. Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working. Hey man, you mind if I run something by you? Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that. Thanks. Did I? I don't... Hmm. Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or... Yeah. Question. Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made? I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that. When will that be? Did the police solve the problem with the... Yes, yes they did, yes they did. Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one. If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd k*ll myself. Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend. Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. [hugs Ryan] Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me. Na? Well you tried. Yeah. They sound great. No, they're just hotties. Hey. Hey! Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada. Alright! Yeah. Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight. Ok. Well. Alright! There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, "What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?" He said, "If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks." Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character. No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit. Do you live in a regular sized house? Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here? Good. Well it's weevil season but we were prepared. They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out. You've already been several times. Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection. I'll order you some cranberry juice. This place is like sexy pre-school. I would love a place where we could meet oldergirls. Ahh, wow. That's dangerous. Amazons. You're kidding. She washes dogs. I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom. Yeah, maybe. [notices previous girl talking to another guy] [Michael and Troy dragging Ryan out of the club] Those girls really wailed on you bad. Let's go. Lucky us. Very nice. [to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick? Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off. Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him dr*gs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it. Well, it's effective. Oh boy... On a wing and a prayer, mostly. A formal warning... [chuckles] [stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head. I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really... [on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big. Thanks. I just- No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so... All right, well it already went through, so... That wasn't a tapeworm. Ronnie was bleh. Things were at an all time sad here. But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard. Give him to me. I want him. I need him. I did! Firrrrre-duh guy! [high fives Ryan] Yeah. You too. I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me. So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry. Kevin just made the list. Well that's great. [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service? But he did, right? All right. This is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction. Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin. And you will be responsible for your own medical bills. Oh, hello Ryan. You look well. Cool. Oh that is so sweet. Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so... It's a small office. [sighs] Sixty - forty. Hm? [they shake hands] I'll drive. We're doing this because of you. So why don't you just go stand somewhere else. [to Ryan] Hey. Hey. You shaved? Why? Finally. Right? Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams. Why don't you have a seat? [Phyllis sits] Let's all clap at Phyllis. [everyone claps] Ok! [in Michael Clump voice] When Michael Clump wants to remind you [normal voice] that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy. And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly. Kelly. [kneels down in front of Kelly, Dwight tries to help him down, Michael shouts gibberish at him] Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair. Come on, stand up on your chair. Stand up, stand up, stand up. Somebody help her. Here we go. [Kelly stands up on her chair] Ok, I want you to look at her. She's a beautiful Indian woman. Why? What makes her beautiful? Hey Ryan, look. Shaved off my goatee. I am goateeless. We are the goateeless brothers. Nice. [they bump fists] It's been a little tense. People are suspicious of me. And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular. I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker. I was just hoping middle school was over. What's the only thing worse than one HR rep? Sure. Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King? Oh, from the insurance commercials! Good morning temp. Hey, how's things? Yeah? Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me? Wait, that's pretty weird. Well, Andy has a mug just like that. No. What party? What would you like to drink? For you. I'm with Darryl. [making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing? This is so wrong. Mmmm.... mmm. This can't happen again. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, it's well-written and all, I just--- Oh my God. He's going to k*ll us. Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, "It's cool". That's all he wrote. Mmm hmm. We're back together again baby. They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny. Oh! Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier. Pam. Pam, you gave me your word. Mmhmm. Hey guys that's really inappropriate. Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them? h*t him! h*t him, Chicken. Son of a b*tch. Walk away. Thank you. I know, can you believe it? I guess that's why we have a temp, huh? How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse? You've seen things cleaned before though, right? I think you're great. You're my best friend. Can't do what? Wait, what are you saying? I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you. Oh, can I come? So you're dumping me? Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. [Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It's Michael. Hey, Ryan. Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here? You get paid by the year at the bowling alley? Back to work, shoe b*tch! Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company? Uh, nine. Sorry! Aw, it's gonna be the [softly] worst. Sure. Oh, yeah. Jim's sorry. Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much. But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do. Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend. Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before? That is so insulting. Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times. Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other. Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals. Really! Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop? I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day. Like how? Dyeing my hair blond? Okay it's my turn. Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it? You're gonna make another "spreadsheet." Yeah exactly. It's my turn. We could work from home. No, you're supposed to say, "Rock the house." Try it in another sentence. Pam, I don't make the rules. [Pam walks out.] I don't know. [They shrug and leave.] Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. [Flips a pancake. It's about 8x11 inches] Young sir, would you like a free pancake? Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen? Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great! I made a sale! Oh yeah! That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan? Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce. Bring it in. Morning cheer. [clears throat]Michael, Pam & Tell us what you're talking about. I'm just getting hardcore with him. [on phone] Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. [referencing rolodex card] Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV? [Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat. [honking horn] Time to make the donuts. [laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van] Come on. Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again. Come on. [does it again] De-nied! You know what we need? We need some couches in here. Yeah, I know what a loft is. Most do in the magazines. Corporate greed? Yeah, with a fixed cost pricing model that's correct. Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is. So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive. So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money. I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart. None of 'em called me back. Not even for an interview. Really? Was it nice? I love Pad Thai. You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for? Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales. Seriously? Are you being serious? Yes. Yep. Oh... wow. Of course not. Ah... I'm good, I'm good. And we are prepared to reject that offer. What? Michael. It's a lot of money, okay. But we need money coming in every week. We need jobs. Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish? Agreed. But that's all, okay. Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds] Someone is returning! He started his own company, and now he's back. Who could it be? I'll give you a hint. He is a man. A man you have missed with all your heart. A man who has ruined all other men for you. Who is it? [hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend. I know. Okay, well--- Against who? What? We were something else. Mm-hmm. Yeah, the Commish. So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you? [walks into kitchen] Oh, wow, Stanley. Is that egg salad? Andy brought some salmon. Dwight, is that a meat sandwich? You guys hungry? I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over. With Creed. Playing chess. At work. He's winning. I feel like I'm describing a dream I had. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. That's my client. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him. Hi, Mr. Bart. Hey, it's Dwight here. Give me the phone. Dwight Schrute here. Hey, don't hang up. Ryan, hand the phone over. You're a secretary! What do you know? What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse? He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now. He'll make his decision by the end of the day. Oh. I think you should get it. You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it. Yeah. Who else? Who else? Ryan? I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now. [putting make-up on Ryan] You know when you love a guy and he's giving you mixed signals but you know he really likes you and you're sleeping together? I'll never tell who this song is about. That is a secret that I will take to the grave. It is, but I'll never say. It's our office, too, Oscar. [to Ryan] I think you might have too much rouge. How do you know so much about what's gonna read on camera? Uh... I lived in New York for eleven months. [Kelly nods in agreement] Ok, Erin. Just sh**t it. After I puff on the cigarette, I'm gonna put it out on my high heel 'cause that's what they do in music videos. Yes! We're still setting up! Cut. Cut. We still have to sh**t our make out scene! [teaching Andy & Erin choreography] One and two and cross and cross. Down. Sexy, sexy, sexy. You guys got that? He's your replacement. Ryan, this video is bigger than you or me. They do have sparks. Once upon a time, she was just a girl, living in this worldThen you came along, with your irresistible charmYou drive a girl wild when you flash that sexy smile'cause before she met you things were going okay,So go awaaaaaaay or staaaaaay! That's really great, you guys. Hey Ryan. So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding. It costs about $75 per person. Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not? Okay, Ryan Howard, yes. I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant. [someone knocks] Just pretend we're not here. Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you. $100 now for sure. Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred. Cool. More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories. Hey. What happened? Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with. What? [over chatter] Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think? Okay. No, no, no... no, no... [Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question. Do you think that I should get a Fedora? Well, I think I'd look really hot in one. Where'd you get your fedora? [Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh! [sighs heavily] I'll give you five bucks for it. Ten. [to Ryan] You're so cool. [Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... where'd you get that hat? I want to sell your blood! These are amazing. You took all these? Oh just by like friends. See you. Hey. Yeah. Never. About what? A little-- what are you talking-- No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now. I-- mmm-- I'm good. Who's Michael? I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare. No thanks. Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook? But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program. Could go either way. Maybe we should just wait and find out. Ok. Quiet! Quiet, please! Please, quiet! Quiet, please. We want to hear your questions. Hey, Ryan. How's it going? Mmm-hmm. Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it. You know what? I think I know the problem. I think you seem distracted. But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help. I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people. Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done. Right. [laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office] Apparently. Not now, Temp. What? Diabolical plan? I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol... [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight's daibolical plan] So what do you want? Yeah. This is all we have. Ryan come here! Come on, come on. Ahhh... Ho ho ho! [struggles to pull Ryan towards him] Come on I need this. Come over here! Just sit down! [opening kite from Ryan] Wow! Cause... [reveals Kite Runner book] Thank you! Alright. Excuse me. [slides past Eric to close the door to Ryan's closet office before Eric can see Ryan in there] If you will - You're twenty minutes late! Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair. Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time. Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw. I like where you're going with this. Continue. I have an old barn! It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what? Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life! He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think! Think! The new IT guy. Nick. I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it. Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock? I don't know what to tell you, man. I'm sorry, I just can't give out his password like that. Are you... you threatening me? [entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible. Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink? Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you. It is not "farm boy swill," I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious. Nope, actually music would just throw me off. I need complete silence. Okay... [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances] You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over. Evolution of dance-dance. Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any? [Stanley raises his hand] Who else? Come on! People, I know models! I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us? Well why don't you invite your friends? Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids. I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring - The Kardashians is a good show. It's about a family. A real-life family. Whoa! What is crackin? What's this game? Yeah, how do you play? Only three tickets. Stop telling me how to spend my tickets. Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique. [Kevin's voice] This is Kevin. This is Kevin. Me, too Oscar. [using a Cookie Monster voice] "My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant." See I did the voice. But parody is always derivative. [typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this. This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic. Ryan? What does he know? When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager. Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see. That seems... quick. Even for lesbians. Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael? Yeah, she does all that. All that does is help you sh**t around things. What does Bin Laden... Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore. Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store. 'Cause it's next to they baby section, okay? I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now. I don't care. I have an appetite for life! [eats cake] Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon. Good for you, man. Good for you. He takes what he wants. What about Kelly? [quietly] Is this a joke? Yep. Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof... [on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1. Hey. Guilty! Guilty as charged! Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges. Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch. Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp. [Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round. So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff? You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK? What are you watching? Really? No way. I think she likes this stuff. Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but... Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism. Good. Really? Today? Oh, Happy Birthday. Yeah, I could say something. All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right. No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs. [laughs] And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs. [ignores Phyllis)] Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart. Yes. All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch? [Ryan scores] Nice! Come here! [gives Ryan a chest bump] [Darryl scores] Watch the long passes, you guys! Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please? Ryan. Would you like to help me with a special project? [in Michael's car] Okay, just throw out all the empties. Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin. No. Uh, what flavor? Blue's not a flavor. What, stop! Whoa! That's my Drakkar Noir. No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it. Not it's not, there's some in the straw. [Michael opens bottle and wipes straw along his neck] There, now you may throw it out. That's over several months, Ryan. Sorry. Yeah. [singing to music] "Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you." Here you go. Except pass that breathalyzer. I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast. Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan. Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. "Home Alone," "Risky Business." Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do. Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration? Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so. Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think. Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be? Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager? [speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is? You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play. Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations. So what was rule two? Okay, uh, well, one is taken. NO! Well, he needs a permanent number, right? No. That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers... Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it? Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh? Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop! So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for m*rder, 'P' is for... ...for Phone. What? Um, oh, thinking about business school? Really? So you think you know a lot about business? Uh huh. Yeah. Quiz me. Quiz me up. When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me. [to Dwight] Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please? [to Ryan] Uh, it's equal. [to Ryan] You should learn from him, right? Right? Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be? I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think? Nah, I'm okay. Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo... Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find. I gave it to you in the car. I saw you program it in. Okay. Alright. You failed? [singing] ...since the world was turning. [looking at Roy and Pam] They are soo cute. Answer me this, though. Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp? Really? Oh... hey. [singing and tapping on his coffee mug] I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day. Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information. Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is. Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. "Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority." Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you. Uh, Larissa Halpert. 117 Mount Bergin St. [in his office on his cell phone, talking in a fake high voice] Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland. This is Tito. Thanks. Stacy. [Taps on the glass in his office to get Ryan's attention] Pick up. They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out. Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now. My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for? I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott. [Knock at the door] Yeah. Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend? If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout. No. They're in the conference room. Wait, are those Michael's Levis? If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang. Pow! Pow! Pow! Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface. Sam, get my luggage. Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them. Hello, everybody? Yeah, uh, attention, please. Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p. Well, the group tour is now leaving, then. Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows. I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to. Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while. We'll see. No, don't! Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away. You don't know that. I did? I'll take the iPod. [after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly. Hi guys. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how's it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin] Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, Merry Christmas. Mine. All right! No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan. Where is my cornbread? Thank you. Did you get all dark meat like I like? Where are the yams? Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg? And they had no yams? Wow, you just dive right into it. uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall? [popping his bubble wrap cast] Hey! You did it! Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan. Did you get the yams? [sigh] Ok, I'll just have the pudding. Yeh. Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain. Mmm, what flavour coffee is that? Up-dog? I don't know, nothin', what's up with you? Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning. Do you think you can handle it? Do youthink? Or do youknow? Just do it. Good. Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis. Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her. It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy. Uh... June. Summer. So, that'll be nice. And that's that. Oh, nothing. What? I did not do that. That sounds disgusting. [to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones... It's the lever on the side. Hey! Nothing much. Let me ask you something. It's actually little awkward. What do you think of Kelly? Are you interested in her? Really? She said lots of things. I have no idea. No. I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever. Alright. [Kelly squeals] Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in] I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So... OK, That's cool. I completely understand. Ryan. Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think. But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding. I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married? Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just... Maybe. Thanks. Yeah. I'm definitely going. Nice. Send me a postcard. God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies! I drink like, a hundred Ice Macchiatos a day, and practically nothing else. There's a really cool coffee place, Jitters, at the Steamtown Mall. Ever been there? You've never been to Jitters? Ryan, you aresodorky. Gimme your number, so I can text you. That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?! Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child! Okay. It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. [gets up and runs out] Ryan, can you come here a second? [clears throat] I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar. I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine? Oka-- Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves. Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer]. Don't be scared! You're good! You're good! I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night. Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me you keys. Don't make me do this the hard way. I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him. Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies? Yeah, we do testing all over the country. You want to work at the urinalysis lab? That's a nice tie. That is... who makes that? Do you mind if I wear that for the photo? "Ryan never returns my calls." Ugh, join the club. Oh, me too. Me too. It's a deal. Yesh. Oh, great. Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse? Oh, it's okay, I'm going down. Awesome! Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay. Do you want to talk about it anymore? You made this? Wow. [impressed] That's... that's very nice. Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they? No, I said one of them is not a nickel. Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ... A man is found hanging from the ceiling... A hunter. So you excited? Very excited? Extremely excited? ... Just very? That's cool. I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions? Do you know where we are, temp? And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you. Smells pretty bad, doesn't it? It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away. Oh hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back. This is Pretzel Day. It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness. You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test? Please be seated. [man runs behind Dwight] Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground. What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin? Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's su1c1de? Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear? Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose. Wrestle him to the ground. You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams. Establish time frames. Keep the phrase "real dollars" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much. Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time. Good. Right. Uh huh. Exactly. Yes. Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much! They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face. Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive. [Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere. Pam? All they are is chocolate, graham cr*cker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been? [laugh] Kelly Zach Braff [speaks in Hindi] Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys. Don't even listen to them. They're so... All right. Good night. So you're saving money... ...to start a family and home. I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst. Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics? [to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense. I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood. That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh. Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right? [interupting] Hey Ryan, you coming? Okay. Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now? Oh. You know, man, it's really you're call. [whispers] Let me get that for you. This one taken? No. Good. [using breast pump] Take a picture. It'll last longer. Is he always like this? Yeap. Yeah. I would so rather be in prison. Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! [employees protest] All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's b*tch. Oh, and you. [points to Ryan] You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap! Ah, I need my entourage [both exit Michael's office] Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters. Why not? Ok, feel better. OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude. I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know. Hey, so what's the status. Oh, you're kidding me? Cold, huh? ... I'll take the kid. No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back. Um-hmmm. You want the lead? So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard. I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan? Hello, Ryan. What do you have for us? Good luck. Hey, Ryan? You wanna pull a prank on Andy? I liked you better when you were the temp. [Giggles.] Look at that. Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors. No. Yes. Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot. Do you guys think she was hot? Do what? I just asked you a question. Yeah, right. God, I need a boyfriend. You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends. Whenever. Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you... Wow. Will they throw their hats, you think? A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air. "May your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... That was a pretty good line. I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey! Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now. The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well. Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies. ...And products! Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a f*re trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT! Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things. Thank you. f*re you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God... No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands] No, it is here. Good thing you didn't listen to me. That is the bravest thing I have ever heard. I can. You would have left me to fend for myself. Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed. Oh it was? Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a m*rder's in your apartment in the middle of the night... ...and you call me, to calm you down... There's a bunch of people back here, maybe... You are so mean. Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard. You called me stupid. Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor. No, no. Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty. What?! So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue. So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc. And let's just say that I just sent backLove Actually, which was awesome. [Karen lays money down on the desk next to Ryan] And they sent meUptown Girls, which is also awesome. But guess what, now I want to see love actually again, [Phyllis throws her money down] but it's at the bottom of the que! Oh no, what do I do!? [Creed throws his money down] What I do, is this. I go online, I go click, click, click. And I change the order of the que, so that I can seeLove Actually[Pam throws her money down] as soon as I want to. It's so easy, Ryan. Do you really not know how Netflix works? [Jim throws his money down] No really, it's, it's very nice. Come on! This is just offensive. Crisis Management Squad. I want you to bring a partner. [whispering] It's just, like, so creepy. Anna Maria's. Six-month anniversary. What? No, we've been dating for six months. Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend. [to Ryan] Come on! Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba! What are you saying? OK, I apologize for yelling at you. www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out. You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management! Good thing I'm baaaaaack. [laughs] Ryan, coffee. [on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty. But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job. [laughs] Great! I'm so glad. We're all very excited you're going to be joining us. It'll be nice to have another MBA around here. Who was that?
