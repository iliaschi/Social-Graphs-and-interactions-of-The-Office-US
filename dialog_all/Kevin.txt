OK, I want to express myself, but I have nothing to say and no medium with which to do it. That's so cool Kevin. Thank you. Where? There's nowhere to run! [gathering himself] Okay... People usually say my voice is really nasally. Stepdad says I sound like Truman Capote, but gayer. Guess her good eye isn't that good because this is the second floor. [scary voice] Not somebody. Parts from many! From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other. Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses "Doors closed" the doors open. Or he presses "lobby" it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that? All right. Are we good? [Luke runs out crying] You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment. Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it. How? I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is. Because it's on my genitals, genius. No! It was like four years ago! Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of sex. Can anyone else name any other consequences? [writing on board] Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels... Express love, magical. Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable? Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat? Yeah. His ass was on that seat? All right! That's a lie. I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs. No. No. No. Somebody in this office. Song's about truth. [plays soft chords and sings] Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away. I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me? This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer. [falsetto] I'll be your croak madame. Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love. Scoopity-splash! What's a seven letter word for purse? So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin? Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I'm having at my bar. Okay. I don't care. You know what else? [pulling fake teeth out of his mouth] The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. [puts teeth back in] You were? Jim and Pam really don't want you to go? I'll talk to them. Okay. Okay. Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't-[sees Kevin and Gabe fist-bump] Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand? Oh, you're sorry? What did you just thought? All right. Okay. Well, don't let it happen again. I- Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself. This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day. You know what, guys, let's just enjoy lunch. [as Kevin runs to grab her] What are you doing? What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you. It is unknown if he is armed with anything. I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city. Kevin! Yes, I am. Are you? What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss. Why did you just say he was the boss? What are you doing? Now that's going on? Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it sh*t. [hurries out] You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended. I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything. [laughs] Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev. It's a new corporate policy. I'm listening. I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell. Thank You. Thank You. Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin. Once a week antacid is the idea to b*at. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes. I don't know. Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now. In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list. Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a... You can't possibly be serious. Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge. No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. b*at it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go. The senator. We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife. Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree? I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis. Uh, we're on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone. What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings. Hi. Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much. Yikes. [everyone gasps] You guys, it wasn't my fault. I know who you are, and I think you should go. Oh, thank you. I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation. Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes. [sticking both ring fingers up] Ha ha, ha ha! But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying. In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions? 01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere. You don't have to do that, Kevin. Why are you eating stem first? The other way. Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it. All right, all right, shh! Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue. [reveals hidden broccoli, spits it out] Oh, God! You guys are pathetic. And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax. It was insensitive and I am sorry. I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line. I don't think I'm there yet, Boss. Okay, oh! All right. I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not... Yeah. That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to? No, she's lying. Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy. Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great. Kevin, you open it up. guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three! Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, "Don't Just Dream it, do it." Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone. [plays Ozzy Osboure's Crazy Train] [running laps around the conference room] Yes! There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type. Are you okay? Here... I don't think I should be married to you anymore. Ok. [office laughs] No no no. Woo-hoo. Ta-da! "Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat." [laughter] Yes. So happy. Yeah. Kevin! Uh, I also don't see Andy. Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh... Yeah, booby honking. Sure. As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly. With who? Okay, this is much worse than before. I'm now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mind-hunt break and look for a heart or some [bleep] in the break room when you're through. Kevin! Do more stupid faces. Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up. Go on. Kiss each other already. [they kiss] Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me... Well, the hostages were scared. Ha! [kicking open the gate in the stadium where the hostages and Goldenface are] Yeah Michael the movie is amazing! You should enter it in festivals! I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals. You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles] [sees Holly and Todd shaking hands in the conference room] Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms. It's great to be among friends, but until then, you suckers will do! Yeah. What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means. Hey what's going on you guys? [walking into the kitchen with Holly, Dwight, and Kevin, with whom he fist bumps] Yeahh! Three muska-queers! Well, some girls go through a phase. Since when did you learn how to read? Yeah. You know how to read... a menu! [Michael and Todd are walking into the office] Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here. Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed. I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier. That's how it's done. Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that. 20. Get lost. Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game? Really? It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out. [playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card . And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all. Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind. We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot. No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have b*rned this place down when I had the chance. You cant go, you're dead, I sh*t you 5 moves ago. I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses. Yeah where is it? Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again. Your wife becoming me will I. [everyone in the kitchen starts cheering, then enters annex] Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado. Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise. Here's the great thing about the southwest; there's so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the Grand Canyon is a forest as lush as you've ever seen. Yep, ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quartz. Little factoid. [interrupting Deangelo] Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour! A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies! [all in conference room] Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter. [standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus] [the manager of Louie Volpies approaches a giggling Kevin, who is coloring with crayons on the tablecloth] Who gave you those crayons? This is a cloth tablecloth! You can't color on it! And cups of coffee. Kevin, I have something for you. You know who that is? [rips the poster in half] Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up? Good, stand up. [Kevin does so] You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore. You will find love. I'm not sure, um, Mountainton? [Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen, Pam comes in with Jim, Creed and Kevin] You should do more stuff like that. So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder. It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking. It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin. Did you break the shredder Kevin? I don't care what your favorite flavor is. Here's a bowl of ice cream. You either like it or you don't. [Andy nods] That's my attitude right now in this room, that's my attitude on Ice Cream Thursdays. Alright? Clear? Any questions? There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys. Who's the biggest client in the state? I say we go get 'em, whatever it takes. Huh? What do you guys say? Right! Or my other idea, 50,000 tiny clients. [calling for the ball] Deangelo! [sh**t and makes it] See what I did there? That's what you need to do. [makes sh**ting gesture] It's that little English. The British are coming. It's a little cramped. How many square feet out there? 17, 18 hundo? [pretending to bounce b*lls off Phyllis at close range] Feel that connection? Don't move your head. Please. Thank you. Oh! Big hand for Phyllis! [clapping] That took a lot of guts! [finishes routine] Ho! I'm Deangelo Vickers, thank you so much, hope you learned something. Uh-oh. Right? Was it Pam? No corporate experience whatsoever. I didn't want anyone with any bad habits. Oh yeah, did he text us? I'm no MJ. I can do his dunk. From the free throw line. Right. Yeah. Okay, fair enough. Kevin, you do it. And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it. [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place] I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager. Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt] Why would I put a banana in my holster? Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs. I put everything back in the vending machine. [leaves the men's room with an empty fish t*nk after flushing the toilet] Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements? No, Kevin, come on. Kevin, not now. Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders] You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist. Oh, it's so wet. I can't. I can't push harder! Okay, how's that? I'm kneading it! [giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one... Nine, eight, five... Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six... Two, one... We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first "B" stand for? [on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens. Tell us the freaking story! Yeah, you gotta know. You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her. Okay. [walks away] I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet! And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl. Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody? [while sighing] I suppose I am. I don't think he meant, that-- Go ahead. There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon. No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking] If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier] We don't need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there- I promise you, we don't need a warning- Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys. Hey! Apt. Apt analysis, Robert. Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it's over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy. Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, so this isn't matching up with this...and I'm not sure which one's right. Can you just hunt down the original for me? Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork? Kevin, do you feel OK? He's making a statement. It's an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin. You keep think that. Kevin, I appreciate what you're trying to do. Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code. And what we're talking about is...basically the speech equivalent... to just wearing underpants. Sometimes words, you no need use...but need need for talk talk. Does it save time though? ‘Cause we've been here for about an hour. Kevin, at most you're saving a microscopic amount of time. What are you gonna do with all this time? K, Kevin, are you saying "See the world"? or "Sea World?" No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. ‘Cause I still don't know if you're saying "Sea World" or "see the world," and it's taking a lot of time to explain it. Fine, fine. I'll talk normally. Your ex-wife? No no no no. I like her. Ah... [chuckling] Oh, you'd go someplace else. That's not it, that's not the answer. It's a wrong answer. Hello. I'm looking for Darryl Philbin? Ok....? Hi. You wanted the job, the job is yours. Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I'll do mine..... walnuts? Hey Kevin, what are you doing? Yeah. So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag? Great. And Kevin. Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh! No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now. Not that, don't... It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just- Kevin! Doesn't apply. Yeah. [sh*t shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse] Exactly. Yeah. [laughs] That makes sense. OK. Good, alright. What is goin' on?! [sh*t shows greased aisle flanked by rows of boxes] And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease? That's alright. Doesn't matter what the name is. Señor Loadenstein, that's stupid. Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.Dwight, Erin, Jim & Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet. [video playing on computer] Sir, I need to be able to feed all the guests. This is not funny, man, let me down. Chapter 9 – The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party. I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously. Whoa! Aw, spoiler alert. When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day. I don't know if I can. [to Kevin] You seem unimpressed. Ghosts don't scare you? Mummies are real. There are mummies at museums. It's true. They've been preserved for thousands of years. They're all over. No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not... The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath, reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi, lurching toward baby, for they were mummies. Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really. Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five. Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project. Good thinking. Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no. Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from? Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us. Kevin has that lovability. Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling] Oh! Not bad fellas, you're better than you look. Thank you. Miss no more! What do you play? Join us! Great! Yeah, even cooler. Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead. Go Eagles! [laughs] Yeah, absolutely! Hey, why don't you and me play those? What should we play? With the crotch. Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going. Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan? Maybe we could switch instruments. Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing. Wanna be with you night and day.Darryl and Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge. All right, all right, all right. Here. Like it? I can't get a f*re pit. I have two babies. So, here what we can do. Game changers- changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again. Everyone, brainstorm some innovations. Don't be afraid to get weird with it. Meredith! [wakes her up] Excited! Kevin, you've been quiet. I'm curious to know what your game-changer is. Cookies. Cookie placement. No! That's the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic. [laughs] And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared? Right. I mean you're an accountant. Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane. You're right. There should be a monument to this. Robert I hate to interrupt. But I would love to pitch you one last idea. I call it the Big Mac idea. It's really, really good Robert. Let me explain. Well what is the idea? it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her. Well that's a sales desk. Cool. Hey! [Kevin embraces Robert in a tight hug] Oh! I actually appreciate the human intimacy. Feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla. One, two three! [group takes sh*ts] Oh. But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed...[Val walks in dressed very formally] whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do... OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something. Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A m*rder or a liar? [Andy leaves] Hey. holds up sign that reads "We're on the longest silent streak in office history! Nobody has said anything in... 14 min!", Dwight hangs up on a phone call rather than speak, Andy sees a raccoon eating a hamburger and tries to describe it using charades, Kevin opens a candy bar and takes a bite]. You really have to say "oh yeah" every time you eat a candy bar? Andy, no- Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that. All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team] Keep talking all you want. That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river. Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes. All right guys, time's up. Who was the relatively unknown patent clerk who discovered that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared? Looks like everyone gets a point for Albert Einstein. Oh wait. Except for the Einsteins. That's all right. Which means the top three teams are going to finish it off in the speed round. So let's get everyone some bells. In third place we have the Einsteins. The standard American analog scale has a maximum capacity of what weight? [bell rings] I'm sorry, no. Over to the Einsteins. Are you sure? No! Come on! Welcome to the Stonewall Alliance Trivia Championships! First prize is forty-five hundred dollars! Riboflavin. Well, please tell Susan we all say hi. What, as some sort of last hoorah? everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Let's just call it a get-together. And let's say no food. That was you, Kevin. Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams] Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim? [comes up from under water] How was that? Cool. [to Kevin] Does Darryl not swim? Yay! [Erin comes back up] Whoa! [sighs] You're an idiot. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Ah! Angela had the baby! Why? Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby? Eh, a little bit. Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family. [whispering] Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive. Knock, knock. Oh! Well, meet our not-so-little bundle of joy, Philip Halsted Lipton. Kevin! Wow, it's so... healthy. No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you. Ah! Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin? I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime. Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson. Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat. Thank you. Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck. Mail call! [sings] His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt. Watson carpet and tile. Whoa. Thornwood Wholesalers. ... yeah... Morning, everyone. Don't care. Tell me later. Yes, I do. Phyllis. What? Good job Andy. You've gotta be kidding me. God bless. Friend of mine uses your paper. You do good work. Bye bye. Okay, this isn't over. Let's stay focused, okay?  We made fun of Andy earlier for getting b*at up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous. [approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies? Cookies, eh? [Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev. No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me? That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me? No, you h*t the road, jack. You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair. Ugh. [laughs] Yeah. Yeah, that's awesome. That's great. No. Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes? 50? You're not talking... triple digits? [tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans] [in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us. Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names. Forget it, man. Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey. [telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we'll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling. I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy. How long do you think it's been up there, Kevin? Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it? Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning? I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way. Let's see it. Show of hands. How? Ugh! I hate that! No offense. 'Cause there's someone already here named Pam. Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party. Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi. Hey, Kev. Nice sweater. [Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean. You promised! Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo? Andy, why don't you tell us about the best erection of your life? Or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they'd like to share? [Creed, Kevin and Meredith raise their hands] For Kelly? Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend! What? Oh, great! That sounds good! Why would that be weird? Andy's just coming as my date. Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy? [points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great! Well, I don't want to get r*ped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two! [Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180! You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God! Yes-- Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev! You're welcome! Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs. What do you feed her? Is she sick? How are her poops? Does she smell? She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown. Can everyone just, please... I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and – how should I say this – Columbian whites. What – what is this about, uh, Binghamton? -pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. It's a paradox to think of any sexual activity as "normal." It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated. Okay. Andy, come on. I told you [Dwight vomits power drink on Angela] [as Kevin reassembles shell] That piece doesn't go there. [Kevin shushes him] Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption. The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked? Please, after the turtle? Nonsense. Get up here. [surveying an untidy office] The building's custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we're living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel. Well, it doesn't spin. We'll just move the wheel one notch each morning and... you see what chore you get that day. [frustrated] ‘Kay. Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink. I don't think you guys understand why we're doing this. It's- With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports. I w-, uh, I would love to give uh- [in kitchen with several people around] Next question for our oldie-weds- [after awkward pause] Sh, uh, um, I was having this separate conversation with Kevin. Uh, Johnny Depp. OK, I have one. I have one. [Jim's phone rings and he motions he's taking the call elsewhere] Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt. No. Not that I see here. Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families? Summer Softball Epic Fails! [Kevin swings bat on screen, fart noise follows] Fail. [repeats] Fail. Oh, I know I'd be more productive. Role Call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah, role call! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Next stop pies! Let's go driver! [clapping] Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so... So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head? Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies? What if it were salads? What? Phyllis! That's not safe. [Reading] "She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents." What? I don't know what you're talking about. [laughs] Kevin, are you trying to get me to h*t you? In the face with my pie? I thought that concert was pretty great. Yeah, yeah, no, no. It's a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can't do if you just keep singing ‘Monster Mash.' Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok? Can you do this, Kevin? Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas. [Oscar looks outside conference room at Kevin and Angela at the copier] Jammed. This day couldn't get worse. [Kevin laughs] Kevin! Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more? I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore. [In staff meeting] See these forms... I have to go to the bathroom! [runs out] [running from elevator] I have to go to the bathroom! That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can. What? Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in. [Kevin laughs] I'm in big trouble. [chokes up] I hope that's it, Kevin. Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about- Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just.. Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me. [gives Kevin money] [yelling in break room] That's what I'm saying! No of course not! Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected. Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion? You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who- Well, thanks everybody. I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control. [laughter] [nervous laughter] Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months... Okay, I'll call you right back. Yeah. That's the idea. Well, I've gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher. [entering] What are y'all doing? Cool. It should be taller though, right? Kevin, I can hear you. Bang. Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I'm gonna let them think the other thing. Hey, hey, hey, it's just a mistake. Just a mistake. That's what this tower's all about --  mistakes. Okay, if you're afraid of screwing up, the tower's not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That's right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let's get back to work, huh? Come on, you in? Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh! Sandwich delivery for Mr. Oscar Martinez. No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside. You know, there's doughnuts in the break room. [cheering] [cheers and applause as Pete puts last card on tower] I mean, it says "X-Mas party," but I think we all know what that's code for. Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee. Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes? Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement? I don't know, I just haven't. No. None of this makes any sense to me! Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans. Oh, that's okay, bud. Common mistake. [Speaking German] Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. [Blows out the candle] Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump. [To Nellie in the kitchen] Here's the thing about moonlight. It's not sunlight. Dwight said it's "Hog maw."  I think they're going to the conference finals. Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough. Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it. No. Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink. Thanks, man. Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this. Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most. We think you made a big, big mistake. Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay? No. Oops. No, it actually feels kinda nice. Hey, look who's back, Dwight Junior. No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder? It's a thing. It means "you only live once". Well... No, I don't... no. Absolutely not! Oh, fine. [puts a napkin on top of everyone else's hands and reluctantly puts her own hand on the napkin] [Meredith, Phyllis, Nellie, Angela, Creed, Oscar, Stanley] We all drink them all! A-bam! [slams espresso cup on table] My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I've tried so far is Alpine Select! Ugh! Kevin! Kevin! Kevin! Stop it! Stop it Kevin! No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it's the truth, I swear. No, I'm not! [Kevin imitates g*n] It's not like that at all! Forget it, I'm so sorry. No, I'm not upset. I'm really excited for Darryl... Maybe I'm a little disappointed that we'll be losing him. Huh? Kevin, move. I can't pull up the rug if you're standing on it with your rhinoceros feet. We don't work for you! The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then. Aha! A lightbulb. A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. [holding note over lamp] Invisible ink. Oh. What? Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? [writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it's an idea. But what does it mean? Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X? That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from? All right, you don't have to. If I ever get that bad, you'd tell me, right? No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors. If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. [exits] No. [leaving] That's really rude. Let's all try to do better next time. Kevin, great to see you. I beg your pardon. I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. [thinks for a moment] Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown. Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk. They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. [to Meredith] They use a watch repair kit. [emotional] Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week. [whispering] We had to let a warehouse guy go?! The whole thing is in ashes. f*re department was here. It was in all the papers. Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete? Hmm. Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk. Hello beautiful. I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy? It looks pretty black. OK. Let's get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd Packer and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did. Do they even have a bakery anymore? [while Kevin stares at his cupcake] Kevin, you can do this. Uh-huh. Yes. He was a good spy. Kevin? Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. [cuts to him arm wrestling Kevin] Na, nothing really. Kevin? I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know. [cuts to him spinning a plate like a record and Kevin dancing] Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. [cuts to he and Kevin sitting on a table touching each others face] Pretty normal night. Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all. [cuts to him dancing by prostrate Kevin] Wow. He is officially the worst human being. But, Kevin that's...  Bye. An American Workplace. Coming soon on WVIA. Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes. This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo. Ok, great. Of course there are! [Speaks Danish] Dumpster Man. Oh, guys, it's starting! Hurry! Oscar is with the Senator too? He knew! You did it, Kevin. [gasps] OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela. Hey, that is a really nice plane. You make that yourself? Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane. Kevin, did you make that yourself? I call for a refold! Really? [to Dwight] Thank you. Ok, that's enough. This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one. You have to choose one now. Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed. I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up. No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats. It's the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She's this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type. Andy's from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and d*ed quietly from a heart att*ck? Yeah, sure. What's your question? Nah. I like my plan better. Okay. Death of a salesman. Sure, ‘Death of a Salesman' by Arthur Miller, it's a great play about crushed dreams. What's going on? Yes. Congratulations. [answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there's a problem it's clearly on your end. And—oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um... what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn't want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should've taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone] [crying] It's just a really nice song. Good night, Kevin. The tea in Nepal is very hot. I'm letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month. Why didn't you pack the apple snacks? Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong. Why don't you pack it? Kevin, what? Ok, you go to the store. Darryl?! Darryl! Hey! No way! Yeah! Kevin, Kevin. Kevin, could you not do that? Here, use my pen. Shhh! Kevin, where are you going? That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he's being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast. Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy? It's just his way of saying, "Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting." Sure. Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That's Kevin. Easy. Okay, watch it. Hey, no. Stop it. No, no! See you there. You have to change the channel to PBS. How many people want the game? [half the bar cheers] Who wants PBS? [other half cheers] Sorry. Tie means I do nothing. All right. Ok, thirty seconds to showtime! [mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring. No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is...for...Kevin. Go ahead and just read the frosting. Uh-huh. Umm.... Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here's your cake. [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby. Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender! [Kevin turns around] Oh. I heard you bought a bar, Kevin. Okay, just talk. It was nothing personal. It's just that you were terrible at your job. No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer. That's it. I missed you Kevin. I'm sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.[video] Just sit here and cry, just sit here and cry! Oh I can so just sit here and cry. You guys are really mean. It can't end like this you know. Slept in my car last night, quit my job. b*rned all my bridges. And I did unspeakable things – You're just not good, you're just not good. – Are you insane? – You're just not good, you're just not good. – Chill out! [crying] Just sit here and cry... [watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It's in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though. Well, this feels like a good place to stop. Let's thank all of our wonderful panelists for being here on this wonderful panel today. [audience claps] Next week at the Scranton Cultural Center don't forget, Irish Step Dancing semifinals. Winning team to Mid-Atlantic. [applause and scattering cheers] Right there, sir. [to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow? Oh. I finally mastered commitment. Hey, has anyone seen Ryan... or Kelly? Oh, that's it. Here. [hands Drake to Kevin] Call child services and report an abandoned baby. We'll find a better parent than Ryan in no time. Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will... who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves. Okay, I need a drink. Hey, bottom drawer. I didn't watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It's just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It'd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I'm a tragic person. I'm really happy now. But...it would just...just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself "be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn't that long." Hey, come here. You guys need to see this. Oh, I can so just sit here and cry. No, but I still have my medal from that. Why do you say that? Yeah, but you're not gay. You're not gay. [mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring. No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is...for...Kevin. Go ahead and just read the frosting. Uh-huh. Umm.... Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here's your cake.

Why do you say that? Yeah, but you're not gay. You're not gay. Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again. I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things. Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers. No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far. Yeah, I haven't asked him yet. I was planning on it. [whispers to Kevin] Subtle. Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go. [wraps them around her IV] Tie these up, cheer up your tubes... [IV pops out] Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake! Thanks. Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad? Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis. Yes. OK. [walks away] Alright, alright. Shhh... I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts. OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant. [runs into the back of Kevin] Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin. Awesome! ...business meeting -- f*re guy [makes flames with his hands] Here for what? Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man... Beard. Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. [claps hands] I run into Vince Vaughn. ... Later guys. Later man. Yeah, he's definitely something. Ha! Tuna... [inhales deeply] Tuna Tuna Tuna. He has a k*ller job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes. So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons. It's never gonna happen. [everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright. Let's quit while we're ahead. Yes! It is awful. You've made this day awful! [murmurs of approval] Same thing. You know what? I don't understand when you all talk at the same time. [sighs, walks back into office] You find anything? Hey! Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin? What have we got here? Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors? Hey, have you seen Jim? My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has sex with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats. You can not, I have a thing tonight. Not a native speaker. Do you really know which one is correct? Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right? A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses. Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that? Do you know anybody in the mob? I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house. Hey guys. I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude, and unsexual. These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun. Who are you talking to, specifically? Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam] I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. [Kevin dumping change in the snack machine] And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence. And Lucy's torn between these two things. She's torn between passion and convention. Yes. What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them? What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?' I'll call back. Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you. He needs help balancing some travel receipts. Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room. I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar. Some of us like the walk more than others. [to Kevin] Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up? I thought that you were engaged? Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends? Oh... It's like a ten minute walk. Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. [thinks] OK, yes that would be bad. OK. Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't. No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again. [while brushing teeth with an electric toothbrush] No, not the five families. We have to. [still brushing teeth] Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now. Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone. You have about ten seconds--- Whose parking spaces? We good? OK. Could have done this over e-mail. Come on. I'll drive. [at same time as Kevin] I did it. Thanks a lot guys, Good job. Yup... Owww! Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write? So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself. Oh, thanks. Oh, okay... I should probably get back to... Entering the.... Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually f*ring him, Oscar, okay? Okay, okay. Great! What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What? Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business! [all four of them sit in an empty booth with small Dunder Mifflin sign] Hello! You can try. But I've looked at your prices. Even with free shipping? Doesn't work. It's just- it's not in the stars, Jim. [Phil sinks putt] Six. All right, race to the next hole! [he runs off to the cart] Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.] Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch] Hello. Hello. [to Kevin] Hi. What do you do? Oh, good for you. Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though. Well that is a very safe place for them. Hey Kevin. Do you need some help? Well, what do you like to eat? Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? [looks at the change in his hand] Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row. Hmm... Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level. Cool! You drive your own car? Yep. Just like you. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Kevin. [answers] Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy. Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back. What is it? Well it was good to see you. Wow, Kevin, really? We're- [to Jan] Sorry. We're in the middle of a party. [to Kevin] Is this why you called me down here? I... Oh, okay. Okay. Oh that would be great. I love pie. 47[ Kevin's Loan, Webisode 01 - "Money Trouble" ] Yeah? Yes, you do. Every few weeks we have the same conversation. "Oscar" "Yeah?" "Can I pawn off stuff from the office and sell it on eBay?" "Umm no, Kevin, you can't." "Can I say I was an astronaut and sell the movie rights?" What do you think Kevin? "Can I sell time shares of my garage?" "Can I rent out my mom's car when she's in Florida?" "Can I be the heir of uh ...and and inherit lots of money?" What is he talking about? I know you have gambling debts. Promise me you will not take out a small business loan and use that money to pay off your bookie. What's a bookie? I don't even know what you're talking about. You are weird. You are a really weird dude, Oscar. So, uh, this would be a loan for an ice cream store? Like Baskin Robbins? Well I would hope so. Yeah, I see you've underlined that several times here. Uh, what does that mean, you'll deliver? Okay, so other than delivery and the rhyming name what are we looking at exactly? Flavors, okay Fudge the Magic Dragon. What are the ingredients of that? And you would make the ice cream yourself? Do you know how to make ice cream? I have a lot questions. Really? What kind of questions? Not something you're going to have to worry about. So do you have it? Let's go. [opens envelope] Kevin this is just paper. Come on Kevin, where's the money? Come on, stop playing games. Get me the money. I'm not going to hurt you. Do I look like I would hurt you? This is a terrible situation you got me into. Get it okay? Look at this car! [gets in car and drives away] Bank loan? What's your business plan? That's mad solid but, uh, you're never gonna get that loan. Cause, you're a nervous sweaty looking man, you know? You project failure. I get a hundred up front plus another five-hundred more once I score the loan. Any other nervous sweaty people having money trouble, you know who to call.[ Kevin's Loan, Webisode 04 - "Taste the Ice Cream" ] I can tell by your perfume you are a woman of distinction. I want you to experience something now. Taste the ice cream. [walks in] Hi, I'm sorry. We've already passed on this application. Can I ask you something? Did you make that or buy it from the store? Its cool we don't even need y'all. I sure my man has a back up plan. You got the loan? How much for one? Goodbye. All right, got it. 2,210 pounds. Math is hard. I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow. Hi. Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing? Guess whose candles they used for the vigil? But he's an idiot! He is not an idiot! He is ment*lly challenged. But he's doing a super job here. [Kelly faints] Oh! It's kind of a good news, bad news situation. The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days. So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off. Yes. Gooooo-tee! Hey Kevin... [Kevin gives Ryan a noogie] That's really funny. It's great to see you Kev. If it's me, then society made me that way. Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, "Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?" Thank you Angela. Thanks Michael. [Michael groans exhaustingly] Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired. No way, lady. Hey, where is the steak sauce? Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again? Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower. Ready to play some games? Let's do it! Uh, duh. No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK? The baby multiplies the fun. Let's just do what you were going to do. Great, they stole my laptop. How does that even compare? Hey, what's up, guys? How you been? Let's hear an opening bid, everybody. Who's first? Kevin do your taxes. He's the tax man. Kevin the tax man. Federal and State. [no one bids] Let's put a smile on that face! Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white. You wouldn't tell your mom? I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. [covers Meredith's face with his jacket] You are now sexy in your culture. Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck. 'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete. I think it's because they respect me. A boss that will not f*re you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone. That's respect. Are you swallowing them whole? You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue? Kaaw! Okay. $645. You can do that? Uck... T.M.I. Alcohol is a drag. Yes. Here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us. I'll begin. This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this. That's how your drinking affected me. Anybody else? Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you? Come on people. If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better. [Kevin raises his hand] Yes, Kevin. That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that. new year, new candy. Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy. Yeah. Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top. That's enough. That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form. I need to talk to you in private. 10, I don't think he's gonna show. Ah, Hillary Swank. Have you seen her with her bangs? She is an amazing actress. She's not hot. [snaps back] No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. [half of office raises hand] Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand. [other half of office raises hand] Thank you, accounting department. Hot! What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here. I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people. Yeah, shut up Kevin. Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the "hot" team to their great joy] Does that end the debate? Don't put that. [granddaughter Prince erases and corrects answer] Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access. Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? [half of office raises hand] Okay. And all those opposed? [he skips back and joins other half of office in raising hand] Oh, how did that happen? We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do. So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket. It's been 20 seconds. Where are they? You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there? Hellloo... [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer] It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good. It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them. Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday. [Kevin is holding two ice cream treats] Two? [enters smiling and waving] Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good. I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay. Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone. It could be snacks, or- Wha- Good God! [gasps] Yeah, I know fixed; that ain't fixed. No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. [all laugh] I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh! [chuckles] [meows like a cat, then hisses] Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue? [Angela licks cat, meows] I have no idea. [high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor? No. TV. Oh, look at that. Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year. You doin OK, bud? Yeah, I hear ya. It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy. So if you think you're hurting... I was stupid, I told him. Oh my God. He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time. I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage. Lynn, follow me, come on in. For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone. Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self. [after a short pause] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev. [after another pause] Where you from? Yeah, OK. Well, he only gets better. We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom] That does sound cool. I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity]. No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused]. She left me. [Kevin walks away dejected] Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera] That's really sweaty. Oh, yeah. [gives Kevin her card] Bye, Kevin. No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right? No! No! No! [sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.' What power? With all my heart. All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance. [to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic. Hi. OK. OK. Oh, nerd alert! Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history. No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David] Yep. Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours. Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent? [Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying. [sighs] Hmm? I'm working on it Kev. It'll be ready soon. Is that what 'soon' means to you? [Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no! Come on man, let's, let's go. [from behind the upstairs window] What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something. Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone. I was going to, I wanted to. But I had to start somewhere. So, we had a personnel change today. Shouldn't effect our day to day. But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones. [phone ringing] You gonna answer that, Kev? Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that. No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier. It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again. Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.] Hustle! You are m*rder the Nard-dog! You're bad at this too! Just transfer the damn call. Wing. Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it! What have you been doing? Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now. Hi. Uh, look it's no secret-- Exactly. Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you. Holdin' down the fort. Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up. This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei. Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin. Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come. Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks. Thanks. Bump! I bumped it! Don't set it to yourself! Look who just woke up! [laughs, scores a point on the next play] I've been up for a while. I don't think so. Do you know someone? This isn't radio, though. You know there's a visual component to what we're doing. [sighs] We would love it if you'd hold the camera for us. [motioning to pad of paper with hangman game, spelling out "S_an_ey is chea_in_ _n _eri] That and that are the same letter. No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed? [entering kitchen area] Oh, that smells good. Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird. Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike. [making a cup of tea in kitchen area] What? So? [laughing] I like tea! Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea! WHAT?? Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning. Michael... I knew it! Oh, just backing up and turning around. I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it. I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. [walks in from shopping, with bags in her hands] What's going on? Exactly! My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?! [everyone talking to the camera] Just-- Hey, what are you guys doing in here? Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me? I was just trying to be unbiased. [leaving his office, hurrying to Jim's office] Michael! Believe it or not, Kevin, f*re crackers are in the don't column. No. This is a f*re cr*cker free wedding. What happens in accounting, stays in accounting. You're an idiot. I'm sorry, it's Kevin. I thought it was Gil? Him? Him? I'm sorry. Nice to meet you, Kevin. I'm so sorry. She has a boyfriend. He's out of town. How did Meredith get put at the young people's table? Partay. Room 639. Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models. Ok. [Dwight howls] That's not appropriate. [Dwight continues howling] Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. [they both howl] Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go. [both howl as they exit] It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece. Oh yeah. What else you got? What else you got? [Kevin rings bell at the front desk] Good morning. How can I help you? You must be Mr. Malone. One moment please. Mr. Malone. Your shoes are gone. No. Destroyed. The bag was opened by our shoe shine and the smell overcame him. I too smelled them and made the choice that they must be thrown away. Incinerated actually. It became a safety issue, sir. I can offer you a complimentary breakfast. Oh... [to Kevin who is bouncing up and down] What are you doing? How long do you take to pee? Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster? No. I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video. I knew we'd need a back-up plan. The boat was actually Plan C. The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her. There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player. Okay. Hello Mr. Halpert. I'm calling from the identity theft department at Capital One. We've detected some unusual activity on your credit card. First would you mind verifying your home address? And may I have the last four numbers of your Social Security Number? Well Mr. Halpert. You're obviously not in San Juan Puerto Rico. I'm going to go ahead and put a hold on your card. Very funny sir. We'll get a new card out to you right away. Have a nice day, and thank you! Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards? This constitutes identity fraud. What's that supposed to mean? Why would I love jail? [on phone] Are you kidding me? Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here! Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority. Cool. Okay. [Pam hangs up] Bye. They're back! Yes! I think we should look into that. If you could just speak up louder... Well, for our profit... [on phone] No, no, no, I'll talk to her. I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I'll let you know how it goes. Alright, by pickle. Don't call my mother your lover. You're not, nope. Nope. Not yet! Ok. Uh... No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance. It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing. [Jim signals for making to stop] No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. [Michael begins to lose his cool] Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. [realizing he's going downhill] Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'. Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice. Why? Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so... Yes. Put the DVD in. It starts on it's own. Let it - Shh. It's on. Yeah-- Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity. Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him. It's not a fight. What other outcome could there be? How? He can't h*t back. It's okay guys... I can handle this. Everybody can go home. No, there is a defense for that. Let me demonstrate. Someone att*ck me. Kevin, go! OK, OK. Good. I'll catch you on the flippity flip. Bye. [hangs up phone] He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free. No, I'm just poopin'. You know how I be. OK, here are your character cards. Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props. Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is. Everything else is up to your imagination. So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse. Well, you do actually. You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth. Uh, not familiar, what province is he from? I do believe that the game is a big h*t. People are really diving into their characters. I know she didn't do it. It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most. Therefore I know the k*ller to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect. Yeah, my boudoir's always open. OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting. Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work. The twirl sucks. He said limousine, so... Who here heard it from Ryan? Yes. Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in- So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing. He thought you were doing an incredible job last month. You seem suprised. Okay, wait, I was not... I did not- Okay. That is me, but I didn't order the cake. Yeah! No it's not, not like penis-wise. [as Santa] Hello little boy, what's your name? Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well. Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go. [Kevin sits on his lap. It's a struggle] Oh my God. What would you like for Christmas little boy? What did you think was going to happen? All right, just say "some toys" please. Damn it Kevin, come on. Okay get off, get off! [pushes Kevin off] Oh! Oh, God! Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again. No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we --[Dwight counts the raised hands] Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost k*lled me? [on microphone] Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get? Thanks man! [awkwardly tries to hug Ryan, pats him on the back] [as Eric is being escorted out by Michael and Toby] Thank you, so much. Hope to see you soon. Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good. This is Accounting. [as Andy is passing her a card] No, no! Hey! [to Angela, who's having a hard time deciding on a chair] Just choosing seats, not getting married. Chop, chop little onion! [on phone] It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye. [hangs up phone, blows train whistle] I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called "Curves." I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it! Kevin, you're such a gourmand. Hmm. Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot. Not all meals. Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner. Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking? [as Pam has another contraction] Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there. Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle. Okay, the opposite of that? There is no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there. I'm scared, too. Oh, boy! ... What's that sound? I would like you to meet your new boyfriend. I don't know what to say. Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together? Good! Sure. Kevin, please leave. Just don't let him sit on you... I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him. Hi. Did you grow up around here? So, you must have grown up around somewhere else? Hey. I have really enjoyed our time together. I want to continue working on our friendship. Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing. And, you're my friend. And I hope that I'm your friend... And, maybe... Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin? Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place. No. Lynn was as hot as Erin. Thank you. You know I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I want to hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that Liquid Paper? That wasn't invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist. No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish. [Exits, closes door, takes off coat.] Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in? Kevin! Damnit [runs over to Kevin's desk] Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon - Really. [begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads? Where are they? [stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey. [dashes to kitchen, overturns the trash can, tastes the bin liner] Clean sack. Wait. What day is today? Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move. It is not that. Kevin! Oh! Hey, how are you? Aw! Yeah! Waaah! [starts to make crying baby noises] Maybe. Okay, we have to get home. [Kevin's voice] What's the difference between a chimichanga, [Kevin arrives behind the group] a chalupa, and a tostada? Call me back ASAP. It's urgent. Say "Me eat cookie." [sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev. I brought those in. It's my birthday. That's some stone-cold narcissism right there. [as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum. They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me. This is violent and offensive. It's awful. [reaches for tissue box, hands it to Kevin] You have some food on your face. Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around. I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue. Thanks. I don't want to hear it. Suspended. Alright. "I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit." Hey Kevin it's Oscar. I'm looking at the sheet you sent me. And I can't seem to find the column for shipping cost. Yeah. "I vant to count to ten". That would have been funny. [walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? "Oscar. I am the Count." Nailed him. Nailed him. [Gives Kevin a fist pump] Good work Cookie Monster. [indistinct chatter inside conference room] Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger. If she is, it's working. I can't stop myself from kissing her. Well, why don't you just move the M&M's? Okay. What do you think? Oh, what's that out there? Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed. Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think. [everyone laughs] Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share? You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with. I'm awful, aren't I? I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for. Okay. [Phyllis avoids looking at Michael] Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. [continues to look away] Phyllis, look at-- [Phyllis turns to leave] okay, that's... [chases after her] All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna. 'Course you all, no doubt, know why I'm here. Turns out our printers are famous. They're all over the news. It's an interesting story. Cheap foreign printers attacking innocent Americans. Well, actually the, the real story isn't quite as racy, but uh... let's give it a go. I'm not sure you do, teddy bear. You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide. Yeah. [Kevin runs to his desk] I already got to yours, Kevin. [Kevin runs back] Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down. Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I... I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me. Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember? Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer. Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on. Oh, yeah. She's hot. Hey. Sure. No. I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food. He literally won't come out of his office. You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic. OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? a**l fissures? Yeah, but no one here has it. Someone has it. I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is. Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey? Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone... I love their sandwiches too. I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box. Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right. No. That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin. Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope. That's disgusting. Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. [takes off sweater to reveal tuxedo] I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may h*t a bump and spill the drink! Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today. She would have definitely slept with me. There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh... [points at Phyllis] Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin. Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner. Yes, your corner. Go. I do not understand what you spend your money on. Yeah. Oh my God! Wait, this goes back two years. [flicks football onto Kevin's desk] OH! Yes! So close. I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game. Yeah. Why? Hey, do you guys have any other games? [sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something. Wow! All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do? Um, not neccessari... Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen. Is there anybody else. No. It's gonna be fun. This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh. Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings] Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man. He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man. Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny. Word. They are not. Yes, they are. [Jan hangs up] That's my girlfriend. No, they just made out. That's it. Don't talk about it. Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved. Yep, right after you. Apres-vous. [mouths to Pam] No calls. There's no time to think about if this is real. Just, shh, everybody. [knock at the front door] The problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother. There's always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler. Yeah. Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight? Where are you off to? Ok, alright. That's ok. It's ok. Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together, you know? Like people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on. Did it work? A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year. You guys should use a hand truck. I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain. So Phyllis is basically saying, "Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth." I gave Ryan an iPod. Last gift. Kevin. I want the foot bath. Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance? No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.Phyllis, Meredith, Michael, Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up. [looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that? You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that. There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell 'em that? A*DS. [low] No, damn it! What does what mean? I agree it's unacceptable. [longing look] [Michael messes up hair to look like Jim's] Expenses. No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig? It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy. Oh ho! Which one is Pam? Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting. Oh, God! How could that happen? How could... right in the middle of the carpet. Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office. Check it out. Check it out. Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee. What is it? What is it? No, just tell me what it is. Open the door up! Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing. Thanks for the head's up, Kev. Sweet. I hate that too. Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. [points] We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here. [on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye. It's from Bob. No, it's not. [walks away] Join the club. So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions? What is that? [coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest. Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? You are the future! This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's. Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one [types]. Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at. Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods] Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date. Did you hear anything yet? Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out? Second opinion on what? Skin cancer is treatable. [singing] Happy birthday dear Michael, [Michael joins in, Kevin's phone rings] Happy birthday... [everyone but Dwight stops] ...tooo youuuu. Kevin? Respect the birthday please. There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover. Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is. [mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day. ...It's something to think about. Kevin. You heard anything yet? Okay. Well. Live strong. Push. Good! That's great. You got it. [Kevin's phone rings] Excuse me. Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos. slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation. [fake coughing] Narc! Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out. Narc! Narc! Kevin? Kevin, what prescription dr*gs are you taking, besides Rogaine? What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means] We just need urine, sir. No. Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable. There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them. Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer. Give me the dice. Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins. Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling] Wow. I think you're bluffing. Oh. Three nines. Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael? I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker. Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play. Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again? She took you down, huh? Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock. Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding? Whatever. I'm in charge of the music. Sweet. All right. It is not an accounting error. Well, it's not my accounting error. Obviously we do need to find it quickly to ensure that it's not a criminal action. Me, too. You guys wanted to see me? So, I know the answer's probably "no," but did you take any money, or buy anything with company money or anything like that? It will never happen again. My boyfriend, Bob Vance, from Vance Refrigeration gave me a Vance Refrigeration credit card. Only for emergencies. You don't use it to buy refrigerators, Kevin! It's better to be embarrassed by the truth now, then to go to jail for it later. Please. If I stole $3,000, I wouldn't be here. I'd be on a beach in Jamaica drinking Red Stripe. Sure. Somebody stole some money. That is fantastic. How much did they get? $3,000. Thank you. Really, genius? [sighs] All right. Who should we ask next? You know, my mom picks the worst times to visit. Well, my mom's in town, but a bunch of my friends are in town, too, and we were going to go watch The Prince of Tides. Well, we don't like it. We make fun of it. It's like a Rocky Horror Picture thing we do. Can we focus, please? Maybe it was someone in the warehouse. Roy wouldn't do it. He wouldn't do it. He has too much character. I do not. That is inaprobable... inappropriate. Stop it! Stop it right now! Kevin... Kevin, you guys don't know anything. We don't think it was you. Well, I mean, how would I do that even if I wanted to? Well, I don't even know where that is. Isn't it locked? Well, I'm satisfied. So, thank you very much for your time, Roy. You don't have to answer that one. We don't know that. Oh, come on. Yes. She said she didn't do it, then 45 minutes later the conversation ended. Fine. I'll write it. No. Fine. I'll supervise. The date should be right-justified. [keys pounding] Right-justified, not left-justified. Do you know what "justified" means? "To whom it may concern?" Really, Kevin? Really? Thank you, it's just easier this way. It's got to be it. You gambled petty cash? That's not the point. How are we supposed to believe you didn't take the other $3,000? You have to admit, man, this looks a little suspicious. Well, it's none of your business who gave it to me. But, I didn't steal any money. Who? All right, you know, there's only one more thing to do. We have to investigate Michael.[ The Accountants, Webisode 08 - "You're Mean" ] 00. You don't have a watch? You can't look at the clock up there? I think people should be self-sufficient. Okay, guys, let's just wait for him to leave. I can't. I have errands to run. I'm going to the mall. I need a new wok. Just stuff like that. You know, I'm not mean. I'm just demanding. I'm sorry if I was mean. Angela, Angela. Okay, let's go. It's not supposed to be fun. ...Again, sorry. What is it? Animal House. You guys are breaking my spirit.[ The Accountants, Webisode 09 - "Michael's Office" ] [Kevin blowing train whistle] Stop that. Receipts maybe. Any evidence he took the money. Or something worth $3,000. I'm gonna go on his computer. No, Kevin, I don't. If I were Michael, where would I hide a key to that drawer? In this drawer. One, two, three, six, nine. Count them. Nine snow globes with Dunder Mifflin logos on them and nothing else. And he keeps it locked. Put it back, Kevin. It's not yours. Okay, here we go. Last transaction was $23 to Jack's Joke and Magic Shop. Last eight transactions are to Jack's Joke and Magic Shop. [sighs] Paying his electric bill. No. Oh... Very well. Very well. Very well. [Kevin and Oscar pound their fists together in triumph] Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right? You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key. What? Really? She's dating? Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week? Previously on Varsity Blues... Oh, I'll be fine. No, no, I don't, but--- Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story. What do we know about this bird? You might think, "Not much. It's just a bird." But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above. g*n. The sales call! Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you. I think about that all the time. Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available. I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going? [points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story? Oh, that's what they call it. I wish some of us still had our shoes on. No one's even going to notice. What does that mean? Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again. I thought maybe DJ's. I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore. No seafood. Okay, forget it. [walks away] Yes! Well, it doesn't... No thanks, guys. Have fun though. I was... Uh yeah, we'll meet you there. Thanks. Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy. Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it? Oh, yes I can. Nothing. Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy. Where'd you get that salad? Hannah? Hmm. Andy? Kuhhhh... you are such a r*cist. Because you think he's black. ...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash. Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake. Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people. [laughs] That is awesome. Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But... at least we got outdoors time. Two hours, every day. Sometimes we'd play pickup football games... Ah. Well. That's not true. No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas. Umm... I don't know? Average kind? Will they still air 'Rudolph?' Hey Kev. No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock. Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three. Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela's flyer.] OK. Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.] Brownies. Cupcakes. [Kevin walks toward conference room] Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some. We're going to ... What're you talking about? When you know, you just know. You don't know? Yikes. Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman--- Guh. I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister. I was definitely right. [both laugh] Oh, brother. Boobs. What? They arrived this morning. Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin? Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today. $100. Cool. Congratulations. Hey, everyone. Oh, that's very funny. Thank you. [sniffles] Nothing. I was just thinking of something else. I call shuffle. Here we go. [Spreads cards out all over the table] Thank you. Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift. At the gym. I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white. No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding. Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you? Huh? Pop quiz. Why is today a special day? In business school, Kevin. Business school. AHH! k*ll IT! k*ll IT! k*ll IIIT! AHHHH! Oh, that duck is so cute. Hey guys. Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet? Oh my God, when is it? On this side. I think I heard it on Roy's side. [tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here. Absolutely correct. Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up. Oh my God, that's a woman's suit! There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual. Negotiations are all about controlling things. About being in the driver's seat. And make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore woman's clothes. Hmm... I don't know. Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip. Oh, thank you. Please. I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly] Anybody wanna take a guess? Anybody? Anybody? Ten people, Michael. Ten people. Would you like to be one of them? No, don't worry about it. We'll just got double or nothin'. I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out. Well, that'll work. Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse. I worked in a warehouse. Men's Warehouse. I was a greeter. I'd like to see Darryl greet people. Probably make 'em feel like wimps. Not me, I... "Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Men's Warehouse. We have a special on khaki pants today." ... This is one example. Oh, don't be that person. Thank you. Kev's out. Oooh! [Jim claps] Okay, okay. You're such a ditz. Yes! I'd say like... 10,000 to 1? Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds. OK, Angela. I love your enthusiasm. All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say "Customer Service, this is Kelly!" Except don't say "Kelly," say your own name. Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name. Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation! [in accent] Absolutely! [in accent] I like ice cream! I need a boyfriend. Huh... We didn't do anything illegal. Except knock over a mailbox with her friends. Kevin, what's four plus seven? Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form. I'm sorry... that you're both morons. I called you morons. Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind? If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models. My car, my rules. No. Thank you, though. Not really. I've seen a bathroom before. I think you mean a girl'slockerroom. And in the fantasy, there's usually girls in it. Go crazy. [in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool. Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked. What are you doing in here? This is the women's room. I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall] This way to the partay bus. I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted. Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals. I'm not going to talk through the f*re after your disgusting feet have gone through. [lying in water, car lights light up his location] Hello? Who's there? My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin. Hello? I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late. Hey, Kev. Oh. Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now. You sure? Wow. Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else? Hm. Really tough call. You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got. There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks. Michael... Wha? Who gave you that advice? I would never do that. Waste of money. In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front. Then who do you think will get the job? Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper. Listen up. Let's start... from the groundup. Where does paper come from? Trees! And where do trees grow?
