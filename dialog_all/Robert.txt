I'm so glad you could come. Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton. Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar. And Merry Christ... mas. A real David and Goliath story. Uh... Human Resources. Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are? Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate? Yes. Yes. [at the cafe on the first floor] Did, uh, you just interview? What do you mean? What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out. You can't. No, it's not. Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made? Honestly, I think I... I sabotaged myself. It's like I'm afraid of being happy. Case in point... I was supposed to start another job today. Here we go. Robert California. Let's have a conversation. Well, I woke up. And I h*t the snooze- The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts? Yeah, that's all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day? What's up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk. And it was open. And people saw this. And they're just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is. It's a photocopy from your notebook. No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it. What? That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name? Warning! Warning! Warning! Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay! Uhhh, the street? Oh, I didn't know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo. Right. You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group? Losers. C'mon. C'mon, c'mon. C'mon. Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo! Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it's really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let's say top-tier and others would be second-tier. Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I'm thinking of. Can you clarify that? I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don't know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I'm not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list. Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he's a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he's hard to love, but did you know that he's in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships? I like my new group. I liked my old group. Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we're gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend. Yes, I do. [to Robert California] Hi Dad!...... Ahhh....oh boy. Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you're here? I'd love some coffee. Are you factoring in the... whole national ...economy.... declining and all that? I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor....vanilla? You were saying you chose me.... There was a reason? Can I inspire? [laughs] I don't know!.....I don't know.[Erin enters with overflowing cup of coffee] Oh, sorry. Oh[Erin sets cup down and Robert sips it] Yeah. It's old. [smiling] Sorry. I do. You know, we've both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up. Now we're in this weird dance.... I gotta go. If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?[Kevin Raises hand] It's a answer. There are no wrong answers. Wait....they're terrified? You got it. Done. Neither am I, it's already done. Hah, I'm just kidding, it's going to take some time. AHHHHH!!!!!!! Pull up your pants. It's after my cat. Ooh, that sounds great. Sure. Uh, I'll hear the other one. You know, the marmalade sounds great. Then the basil will be fine. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA! Welcome. Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad. Pleasure. Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade. You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once. Yeah, yeah. My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer? Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking? I can get you exotic meats – hippo steaks, giraffe burgers... No. You're wrong. Yeah! I'm too hot anyway. Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack att*ck! Yes. Hello. Can I use a computer? I need to check a hurricane. Here, use this one. [walking to Jim's desk][Jim shakes his head "no", Andy motions to him to "shh"] That stuff's for babies. Wow, who sh*t our grown-up party with a kiddie g*n? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool. [singing and dancing] Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew. Thank you. [Gabe mumbles] Great. Mmhmm. I guess. I try not to think about it. Never marrying. You know that's... I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too. What we have here is a classic misunderstanding. All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so... Did you think I was going to f*re you? No I wasn't. [to Robert] I'm sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you. Wow. I'm so happy for you guys. Um let me know when you get to forty. I'll see you guys. Hmm. No... [talking to Robert] Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps. Oh, come on! Oh my goodness. Nooo! Jim. [rolls eyes] [laughs] Whose your favorite iron chef? You go first. [runs in and interrupts] Sorry, go ahead. Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted "We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants. Umpf...that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there. They're both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City g*ng and Angela, if you can picture... I would agree with that. End the mistakes, easy- I would like that. If you h*t another horse, you've dug to far. Robert. Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting. You up for a game? Alright. Serving. Serving. Serving. Serving. [a text tone goes off] Is that my phone? Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright. Oh, oh yeah. Yes. Right now? Yes. Here you go. [throws it over glass] Whoa, no, wait, wait, wait, whoa. [tries to catch it with racket, misses, lands on floor] Awww, sorry. Did it break? You sure? What kinda iPhone is that? Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting? Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone] They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I? [hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down] I'm alright. Yep. Yep. Ah. Oh. [and skinned elbow] Yeah. That does not feel good. [sees Robert California enter] Hey Robert, are we meeting early? Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes. That was never agreed upon. I have a tambourine. [to Kevin] CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends. Hmm. You guys sound great, man. You do that on TV! Yeah? Okay, this is awesome. Maybe we should warm up with some scales? The f*re pit is a no-brainer. Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again. Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg. Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon. Get out of here! May I go first? Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper. Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so- If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister. In the African-American community- Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it. At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet. Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So... Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.' 'Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... [scoffs] like, forget it. how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal. [Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren't going to look back. I don't know. Never trust a cookie with a woman's name. Pecan Sandy. Lorna Doone. Madeline. They'll just break your heart. What?!? No! No! This is not fair! This is my idea. He's trying to steal it because he's jealous of me. You know what? Now I remember. That was your idea. [patting Kevin on the back] That is 100 percent your idea. Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it's like taking a test, but I know the answers. That's why my foundation – The Dream for a Wish Foundation – is going to put them out of business. They're not going to know what h*t them. Hello. Oh call me Susan please. Hey there. It's a pleasure. I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We're 100 percent staffed up. I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying. I'll explore exploring it. Those are fully staffed as well. [laughing nervously] Yes. Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there's no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don't we just let it go. There are lots of considerations. We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello? Hi gam-gam. Are you taking your med-meds? Your employees don't seem to be taking to me. [in robot voice] What is going on? [to Susan] Cameras... Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here. Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine. No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him. You sure about that? No games? Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me. Why do you keep looking at my husband? No games? Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, "in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen." [laughs] You lying son of a b*tch! No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there. Robert... He just rolled out and crawled out. [to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs] Nice pelvic bowl. Deep. [grabs Jim's leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna! Do I? [laughs] I think we've got ourselves an answer. [sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking. Uh... [Robert holds the door, she walks through] Thank you. [leaves] That's OK, I don't want you to do that. Eww, what is that? Hey, man. Kevin? Yeah. Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up. Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink. Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it. Will do. OK. [takes sh*t, group laughs] Whoo! Jiminy Christmas! h*t 'er up. Whoo! [group laughs] Thank you. I would like another alcohol. What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings? And... And you have any advice or anything? ...Help me feel better... Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now. Corporate says to me, "Gabe, we need you in Scranton." Scranton says, "Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there." So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying. Robert. Yes. You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic. But I can give you this pitch in one minute- You're really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. [Dwight sighs, Gabe's phone rings] Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking. Your wish is my command. Robert! Robert California! Robert! Flying jib is correct for the Einsteins. [cheers and applause] Yay Robert! Dial it back, this isn't Tail Feathers, okay? [laughter] No thank you. A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, "table for one?" How is this possible? Who is going- N... it's complicated. It's a job interview, not a flea market. Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait. You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent. I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke. I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing. Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here. Kevin, no. Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it. Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way. I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you. All right- Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight! [sees wine collection] Holy cow! How many bottles? Three hundred? Robert, you are too kind. Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical. Really? Why? I don't know. It looks pretty great to me. To the kitchen! He's not looking. [Dwight dumps her in the pool] Hey! To both these bears. Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused. And I am Bacchus's friend! And there's my talking point. Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away. Robert. So far, so good. Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous. Mm-hm. Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove. 00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap. [on phone] Hello. Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick. [standing in ocean] ...Florida Flu. I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I h*t the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? [picking up dead fish] Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP. Can't you do something about this? Robert, is Nellie our new manager? [laughs] This is an odd situation. But it's very interesting how it's playing out. Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises? Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis. Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry. Yes. Oh, god, nature, please. [exhales sharply] Was that not the-- Mm-hm. Was that it? No, that wasn't bad. We believe! We believe! Welcome back, Stanley. [Stanley grunts] Oh! [takes out earbuds] Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day. Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness. Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze. Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse! Ah ha! Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it. If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm? Yes, Robert! Yeah. Why Jim? Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So... we should probably... go. To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company. Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer. [picks a card] It's the four of hearts. Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo el cardo, senor? Hmm? Ha. All right, the card is picked. Now sir, will you please shuffled the deck? [Jim drops the cards] You didn't just do that on purpose, did ya? Huh! Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see? That's about it, yeah. No. This is what I was trying to tell you. Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes. You're both adults. I'm sure you can figure this out between yourselves. Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important. Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what. Couple of times. This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on. You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it. The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral. You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit. That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys. Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me. No. I'm saying no. Oh God! No. Looking good, RC! Oh man, this is weird! I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela. Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas? You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control. Evil! [chuckles.] although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants. You're being a Thomas Oregon! Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow? Before we bring out our guest of honor tonight, we are very proud to introduce a great philanthropist and a great guy. Robert California! can you believe this guy? Not a joke. That was not even a joke. I will! I will take all of those dogs! No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated. Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies. Yeah, the Syracuse branch can't be happy you're taking New York clients. Why did Binghamton close? The branch closed. Forever. I got your voicemail. From – from last night. And the answer... is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves] Oh, it was this summer – Um, I am a little busy. Yeah, I can make you a list. Why don't I help you now? Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim's leg. [Doing dishes] Sorry, not Jim. Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries. Robert California. What a surprise you're here in Scranton. So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place? No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead. Make a decision. Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. [walking to car] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all. [Walks into conference room] Hey. I stole Nellie's phone. What do you want from me? Hi, Nell, it's mom. Do keep your chin up. It can't be as bad as you described. This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections. Sounds like it. Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you? Okay, that's enough. [grabs phone] No, no, no! Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They're all deleted. Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And... I have a new friend. A friend. At work. There's a call for you on line one. He says salvation. No last name. [in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don't, and I will find another buyer. It's just business. Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple- It's not misleading. Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers] You okay, Robert? I do adore you. Yeah, I know. Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company. Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there. Well, okay. Great to meet you. Pleasure. That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that. But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important. I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me. Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts? Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips] Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan closes limo door] Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity b*lls. Andy! Question for the Senator's beard. Yeah. Poor Angela. Oof. Always hurts to hear that one. Come on! Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it. Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds. Clark's a dead man.
