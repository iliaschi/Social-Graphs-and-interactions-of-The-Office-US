[song ends] Toby, how did we do? Yes. Of course. Okay. Wait, what? I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door] Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell. I know what you want to ask me. "Did your mom ever see you naked?" You don't want to know. Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now? One hour. One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today. No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time. You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me? Tell me! Toby, can I really tell you anything? And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight? [howls and growls like a werewolf] Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? [pause] Three hours. We're half way done. Yes. Absolutely. Right away. Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today. This is plenty complicated. I've played it once or twice with Jeff. Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married. Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though. Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager. Yes. Don't forget the pipe. I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid. I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better. Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly. When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so... Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a g*n. Son of a b*tch. Wow! Ok. You. b*tch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game? You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry? Ok. So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation? That is not how it seems to me. You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior. You forged them! You forged the forms! Yes. Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake. Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the r*cist brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing. It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that. Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right? Kelly! Great costume! [handing out cards] For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prost*tute are from Cabo Corrientes. Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals... Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement. Hi. Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you? Death to Toby! What's the case, Toby? Is it criminal? Have we heard of it? Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex sl*ve? Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail? Oh, Scranton Strangler! [all react] That was the worst joke ever. Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye. What? What? Hold on, Holly's coming back here? Oh... What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse. That scowl. And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions. Okay. Hey, Toby. No way. That's increadible. You know what's crazy? What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting. So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out? And impressions! Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! [Toby comes up and take the mic] [hangs up and composes himself] Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. [looks at the list of members of the office, with some names crossed out] And I have said goodbye to half of them. [grimaces and nods, Toby nods back at him] Okay. Okay... [walks out embarrassed] I can bring him a welcome basket. I'll surprise him. Does he like jams? My shelves are over flowing with preserves. Change two, Toby, you're gettin' a new chair. Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting- Okay, sorry. I have no way of knowing if that's true. Okay, really? Come on. Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office? Nice try. Did you just trademark that... The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize. You don't work in sales, do you. You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don't be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don't ever think there is. There is only... sex. Everything... is sex. You understand that what I'm telling you is a universal truth,... Toby. Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke! I thought that was your job. You guys pay for relocation, though, right? I'm having a bad time. [chuckles] Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone. First, I'll take down the cubicle walls. I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby? Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about- The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling. I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport. Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. Alright. [hangs up] I'm the valet. You have to give me your car. I'm the... I'm the valet. You have to give me your car. Give me your car. Give me your car. Get out. Have a good time at the thing. Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault. And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do. 1, 2, 3!Gabe/Kelly/ Fine. Yes. Dying alone, that is very scary. And how are you, Toby? Toby? You're fired. You heard me. Pack your things. Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship. Yes. For Gabe. Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse. I'm not technically seeing her, but uh I've seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So..[holds up fist] Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know? Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays... Toby I'm going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she's going to be screaming it tonight. Hey! Watch it. Well he's probably a drug dealer. That's the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow. Pam you look more beautiful now than ever. Really well thank you all. Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing? That's okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time. Who walks around with their passport? Have you had any? Ah! I've been att*cked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer! Hmm... You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A m*rder for framing. Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective. Andy, you've gotta be kidding me. Um, it ta-, um it depends. Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine. Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right? Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club. I would love that. To both these bears. To madness. [Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine! [demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually. Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too. Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas] Hola Toby! [mimes choking] Uh- Thank you. sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby. Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why... Toby is giving us self defense training. Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense? We are closed! Come on. Ow. What the hell, Toby? What if you're being att*cked by a ... smallish man who happens to not have a groin? Why don't we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man. So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself? Can I please leave? I have a r*pe flute. Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink! So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- "How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls." Yeah.  Thank you. Thank you. Whether it's a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity. Good point? What is a tub of electricity? Good. Let's go. Let's go Kelly. You think you're so pretty!  Well you're not gonna be so pretty come Prom time! Take that!  Not so pre-violent anymore! Damn it. No. No. I been selling here for five years. This is my spot. You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting. I know. But sometimes you still get a little something. You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport. I do. [to Toby] Huh. h*t the road, jack. [looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me. Thank you. No, no, no, no. It's not worth it. Hungrier. [in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex. I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens. Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony? This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child. How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation. What? You messed up saying your name? Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff? [pointing at Toby] There he is. That's Lloyd. Where do you get off crossing state lines? Now, we're actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe. That's true. That's true. There's no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands? Stay out of my state. It's in your best interest to stay out of my state. Just stay out of New York, Lloyd. Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh? Oh, get out, skeleton man! [his phone rings] Huh? Hold on. I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy. Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace. An Altima or better. [tossing out winter coats] I don't need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan. I'm so happy for you Kelly. Helpless. [Playing computer game with Toby] You're looking good. Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive. Yeah, I gotta go David. [hangs up phone] Why is Nellie still here? Mm, then I will make up a cause. Then forget I just told you that. But your mouth is ble— What? Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. [to Nellie] I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity? Pam's first celebrity crush. Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to- Johnny Depp. [everyone looks confused toward Toby] Totally. George Clooney. OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please. Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall? What? Hey Toby. Yes. Yeah. I... Yes. I thought I'd you know, be you. [looking at folder he brought Toby]It's clearly not an accounting mistake. So... Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that. Those figures I gave you? They're false. I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively. Yes, he's innocent. What are you talking about? I just did this now. Sure. That's gotta be tough. Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh? I have very fertile hair glands. God! We even go to lunch, pick up babes. [sound effect of throwing ball] Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted? My pastor said it can come from breast feeding. Well, he didn't fight me hard on it. What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet? Is it called red-vining? Where are gay mens' vaginas? What? When two gay men have sex, how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person's penis? Things? People?[Jim chuckles nervously] I'm sorry, the--Uh, the Scranton who? [Gasps] Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.[Stanley gets up and leaves] [Pats Nellie on the shoulder as he's walking by her] See you next Christmas. Okay. Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there. Very impish.[Nellie and Toby back in the kitchen, Nellie looks bored and standing against the fridge. Toby walking around] Shh. [Puts her finger to Toby's lips] Shh. [Put her finger to his lips again] Shh. No...more...talking. Fun. Oh, thank you. I don't know, I sort of thought-- Oh, I don't know. Okay. Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one. I didn't really think about it like that. "What we have"? Yeah. [to Nellie] Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. [Nellie nods] Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn. Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that? The first 'sorry' sounded sincere. Toby? No. Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge. They already have a contract? [Reading] "Mutually agree to-" Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch. Well, I'm not signing away my rights. Ok, well we'll see about that. [crumples paper] This is not an office so much as it is a uh, rec room with a bunch of computers in it. Frankly, if I had my way, I'd toss the computers in the gar-bage. But unfortunately we use them for practically everything we do. So. That ain't gonna happen. He's a temp, don't worry about him. Alice! Alright, stay awake ok? Um. Oh no. No no no no. No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes. Thank you Angela. Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name. She's looking good. Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb. Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and f*re her? Of course. Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question. It's a little, uh, personal. I wanted to talk to you about your divorce. Sorry. I—no, no, no, what I meant—what I meant actually was— You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it. Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple's counseling. No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we're just starting couple's counseling. Uh, which doesn't sound any better. My mistake. So how does it work? It's like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or... Mm-hmm. If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I—this will be so huge for our family. What do you mean? That was exhausting. Well, they deserve each other, then. That is for sure. Oh. Hey, champions. We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill [cut to Kevin flying paper airplane], others relied on showmanship [cut to Dwight throwing airplane at Nate with an apple on his head] others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. [cut to Creed throwing a melon] And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster. Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep. [Pam's plane h*t Toby in the eye] I didn't see you! You should have yelled "Crossing!" Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols. It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt. And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two. Go away, we're running lines. Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. [moves to lift Toby's eye patch] Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go. Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all. Yeah, but here's the thing. I can't have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I'll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners. Seriously? Come on, just do it. All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. [starts touching Toby's thighs] God, Toby, don't—stop blocking my hand. This is your—you brought this on. Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone's ever been fired, Toby's blocked it, so... Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I'm looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can't wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone. Oh. No. How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me? No. And I thought I unfriended you. Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab? Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody's actually filming you anymore? I don't know. I've just always been really good at dancing. Is it me? Is it Nellie? Good night. Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby? Come on. Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone's ever been fired, Toby's blocked it, so... Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I'm looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can't wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone. Oh. No. How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me? No. And I thought I unfriended you. Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab? Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody's actually filming you anymore? I don't know. I've just always been really good at dancing. Is it me? Is it Nellie? Good night. Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby? Come on. Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us? That's cool. Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs. Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite. [pulls Toby's pants down] Beow! [laughs] Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax? Oh, and I get to carry it. Have a seat, I'll write it down. I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office. Hey Toby. What's this? [holds up memo Toby has passed out to the staff] [reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection. Oh really. Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight... [to everyone in the room] For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity. Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us? Hey Toby. Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company. Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles] Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...? What? Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did. I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning. [gets up and leaves restaurant][ New Scene ] [under his breath] Nice to meet you. Yeah, sure. I'll, uh, I'll see you tonight, right? Whoa. Easy tiger. Okay. Bye guys. Nice to meet you. Whoa, Toby. Watch out. You're going to violate your own PDA memo. How did he use it again? Thank you. Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside? Fine. I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book. Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading. Yep. No, I mean I really liked it. I thought was uh, a fun read. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, that wasn't fun. How does it end? I love camping. [in a singing voice] Anything can happen. Morning. Did you sleep in cabins? Who went? Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, "No more s'mores, no more s'mores." [everyone in room but Michael laughs, Michael exits break room] [from outside] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up. Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks r*fle into safety mode] on. Toby. Oh, thanks man. Is there anything -- Oh, OK. What? I remember that. Seriously? No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps. Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition? OK, let's make ten copies of this diary. [looking for a place to sit, goes to Toby's table] Can I sit here? Aren't we trying to determine whether Michael or Jan were engaged in a romantic affair? Not Michael and this Ryan person. I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number? Aw! That's great Toby. Toby, you're the best. Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or... We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas. OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go. I know how to throw a football. I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles] ...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water. Ugh, what? What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened. That? In the conference room? We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did I stutter," and I said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" It was joking, Toby, alright? "Hey um, you're poor." "Well hey, you're mama's dead." That's what friends do. It's... you're so white. Mmhmm. Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but... Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright? Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left. Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days. Mornin'. [to camera] So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And... [watch beeps] I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel? Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson? As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day. I love the view. I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word "perfect" in here! Hmm? [knock on door] Yeah. Oh, hey, do you still work here? Nah. No. I think I will pass. [to Toby] What did you do to him? Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica. Well I was taking the picture. Sure, do you have a camera here? Okay... [knocks files off desk] Sorry. Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party? I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'. [enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes? Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed. [takes out note cards] I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are? Thank you. [reads] What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin? Well, no no no no no... Oh, I'd like to hear the answer. [hides his face from Holly; whispers to Toby] I'll k*ll you. I guess everything's okay. Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which... Well... That's my watch. What's protocol on this? Mr. Andrew Bernard... it's got a nice ring to it. Oh, yeah, um... Sure. Meredith, do you mind? Okay. One two three- [takes picture] Oh let's do it again. Pam your smile is weird. Well this is it. I am here to see you off. Sorry. Corporate policy. Okay, security guard. I don't know about anyone else. But it was a good summer for me. I lost seven pounds. And you know what? I'm just gonna take five days off anyway. Hmmm, dare I? [laughs] You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake. [walks to the annex, standing in Toby's cubicle] Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. [turns around and sees Toby] You want to see some really high caliber acting? Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. [walks to the annex] Hey Toby, great to have you back, man. Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again. You're welcome. Missed you. Missed you as part of our family. So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun? That must have been fun. Nice beaches, pristine beaches? Why'd you come back? Why didn't you stay? I bet, for you. [shifting uncomfortably and sweating] Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself. Are you happy you did? Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch. Come on! Come oooon... Are you really not going to punch him? Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator. Sir, can you step away from your desk please? Sir, please step away from your desk. They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission. Uh, you know what? I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding. Sir? Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson. Sir, did you recently return from a trip to Central America? No, no no no... No, no. Oh God! Turn around. Do you have any w*apon? You must feel pretty good about yourself right now. Hmm. Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere. You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us. So... Yes, you did. And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history. Do you want to hear a lie? Alright, so, teams forming. You are the silent k*ller. Go back to the annex. Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party. I got it on a website, that's not important. Really? [whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned? We're party girls. [shouting excitedly over the phone] Daddy, daddy, daddy!! No, No, No. No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it. Yo. Oh, that's my last one. Thanks man. Not my problem. All right man, don't cry. It's cool. I'll let you get it for $400. You can owe me. I know, right. Merry Christmas. Something wrong with the doll? You don't have to kiss his ass anymore. Yeah! Would someone just make the copy? The man is wearing sandals. I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work. Gross! I mean he looks like he just got off the boat. Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby? So trained to deal with a hysterical woman. I don't want to look at his feet. [storms off] Do your job! I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change. No. Mmm. About what? What? What's wrong with my outfit? You don't understand clothing, Toby. You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki. Listen up, Flenderson. You're being weak and ineffectual. I'm cowboying this meeting, okay? Here are the new rules. Earth tones only. Also, women are forbidden to wear pants. No. That's debatable. Ooh, where has this guy been? You're running from the problem. It's true! Oh yeah, with Bernie and Efrem. That was hilarious. [to Andy] What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog? I was rushing to fill an order. I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf. Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me. I'm talking about... hmmm. So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying. Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People don't just fall off of ladders. Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake? [imitating Darryl] Y'all having birthday cake? Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes? It just doesn't add up. Yes, definitely. Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched. I have been my whole life. I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house. Yeah. Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime. Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming. Here, get down! He's not using crutches! Get the camera! Oh, worker's comp, my ass! Toby... Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans] Oh man! You okay? I need to see your pupils. I need to see if they're dilated. Are you... are you serious? Be... cause you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this? Michael, I really don't know what's going on [police sirens in background] down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit. Wait! They're using the lift as their own personal elevator. Really? Then why is there new wood only on one railing? Hmmm? We should check the security tapes Toby. Yes! Phhhht. No judge is gonna believe that... Ahhh, kay. Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives. That's rude. Toby. I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour. [looks over and sees hole in his present] Crap. [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up] Come here you. The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. "Mental" is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it. Get out. Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between "sane and others." Toby has ment*lly checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The "coalition for reason" is extremely weak. Oh my God. Not now, Toby, my God! Get the hell out of here, idiot. [walks into Toby's office] Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute? Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry. Can I sit down for a second? This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation. She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here. Really? Would you do that? [hugs Toby, who smiles big] You're a good, good guy. I'm good... You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends. Sure, what's up? No... that's... You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving. Come on, man! Oh... Right. Okay. [stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot. Okay. [punches Toby's hand] Wow! Behold! [extends his arms] Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas. [Angela claps] Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget. Oh the Anti-Christ! Oh but I can push dr*gs in here? Is that what you're saying? [singing] My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's b*ating... Yeah! That was the idea. Awesome! He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question? Ignore him. He's the local lunatic. Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits] Um, are there any outstanding liability issues to be aware of? Well, safety issues, injuries that could leave the company open to potential lawsuits. So, the staff? Are people generally happy? In what way? So... generally? Generally. What about non-safety issues, in terms of liability? Sexual harassment. Anything like that? You, you don't know. You're the head of Human Resources. Ok. [clip montage] Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin'? Whatcha guys talkin' about? Stuff. I love stuff. Oh, time and resources. This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive. [to Toby] Right? Would you agree with that? [in line to fill up water bottle behind Kevin and Toby] Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach? What? Come on, Stanley! Okay. We're going now! I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush. Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you - You are throwing up for the wrong reasons! [answers phone] Hey Toby. Very interesting.  Pfffffttt. You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this? You line them all up, you take one b*llet, sh**t them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. [stands up and points to Phyllis] Phyllis, you're h*tler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together. Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay. Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was. And we didn't find anything on your computer. Except this. [hands stack of paper to Toby] I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I'm just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid? The way I look at it, there's only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn't know herself, or he wants to use her services to mop up after a m*rder. Oh... yes. [sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand. All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good. Get out. Come here. [hugs Oscar and In a low voice] Don't cash that till Friday, OK? Yeah. Thanks. Toby, Katy. Yeah. Cool. What year were you there? Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right? You and your wife, and you have kids. Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too? Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. "Old School". Yes, Toby? Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family. No, no, Toby. No. It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on! What? NO! What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes? Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away. [kissing noises, sheep baaing sounds] She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her. Thank you. Hi, is it over? No. I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over. Um... what about office romance? Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin! What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her "partner" in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line? What if they made out? In front of everybody? At home? And I told everybody everything about it. Hey, Toby. You said that we could come to you if we had any questions. Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vag*na look like? Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly. Good. Good. And... No, I've seen the video. Is your wife still your contact? 'Kay. I've got the key. Hey, Toby. Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday. Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner. Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion. Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody. [now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael. [unwrapping the poster] Yikes. We can drink? Hey! [loud noise in bathroom] No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me! I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall. Ugh, not you. Someone else. Get Pam. Get Ryan. He needs to lift me. [Ryan shakes his head] and he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel. No, he's not. I just saw him. No he did not. I don't need his permission. I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter. And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us. Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work related? I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there. I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice. Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up. When did you go there? Really for like how long? [looks at Sasha] Mmm... hello tiny one. Yep. [spreads tablecloth] No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves. [Toby knocks on door] Yeah? Oh, that's okay, she can keep those. Thank you. You have to ask me that because you work for human resources. Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost. Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids? What about... ...Jan. Kay. ...Or biologically. Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I... Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will! I never really thought about death until Princess Diana d*ed. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's. Somebody got donuts for my birthday! You didn't know it was my birthday. Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut [closes box]. I hate you. And laughter... also. Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party. Is that true, Toby? Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal dr*gs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with? Yes it is. Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair. I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly. [walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio? Angela! No. Yes. Yeah? Okay. What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So... Okay... what? It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste. Yes. Are those all the other complains? I would like to see those please. You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file. Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it? [sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's. You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me. That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ? I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking. To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn. Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York? Oh... ok. I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file. Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna... Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me? What are... That's insane. Wow. No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody "f@ggie". Why would anybody find that offensive? That's what f@ggie means! No not really... It wasn't just an action movie, it was d*e Hard! Exactly! Yeah, I know. OK, a little too far, crossed the line. That's not what it's called. Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It's not like gay... shame festival. So did you hear? Pam's back on the market again. I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat. Hey! What's up? [answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What's up? Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here. Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has d*ed. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk. [breaking down] How do you know? That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing? Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second... No... No, You're not going to collect them. [facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down. You knew about this all along, didn't you? I don't understand. Hey! How'd the run go? What was your mile time? [scoffs] I could b*at that on a skateboard. Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk. Hey, Toby! How are you, man? I just wanted to say hi. Oh. Is that like your new thing? No. It's cool. All right. Good to be back. All right. No problem. [off camera] ...what? No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself. Yeah. Shh! [answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from? They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so. [to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving Kn*fe out of the trunk. That's crazy. It's crazy. Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas. It's Christmas Toby. Toby... [sighs] Please? Please? It's all... [Pam walks away.] OK. Yeah, we do a raffle... Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing] Not now, not ever. Aww, none of your business. That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops. This is probably the icebreaker you need. I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv. No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo? [to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her? One... Two... Three. Ahhhh! [Phyllis throws the flowers, Ryan knocks them out of Kelly's hands, Toby's date gets them] We have... a bat... in the office. So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied? Oh! No, you should go. Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out. Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you. Hey, don't you have a daughter? No... Ok, what... what is the situation Toby? Thank God. I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an att*ck position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my w*apon from its secure hiding place. Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end. You know what? I didn't--- ...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not. Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night... I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you! Toby, come on. Let's go. What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher? How about you, man. Comfortable? Maybe I'll stay overnight. Got a cousin lives down there. Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers. No. You gonna play it like this? You give me a good raise, or no more sex. [Toby begins to write] [to Toby] What are you writing, perv-ball? Just preparing for the deposition. Ok, Toby, how about if you... Toby now has the floor... and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go! Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and... Ok, you know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not? What about a long sleeve T? Long johns? A shaw? Yes. Okay, let's do another one. This is a good one. "A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---" Just... Here you go. [hands money] Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone] What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down] Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... [laughs] Oh, come on. We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul. Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher. Yes. [in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often. Well, you can't swim in leather pants. [laughs] I'm just yankin' your chain. Not literally. Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going. I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck. Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.
