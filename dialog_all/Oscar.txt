Coffee Monkey's arrived. He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. [starts drinking coffee] Ah! It's not cappuccino. Luke is my nephew. No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't? I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you. No, man. There was no list. Uh, but I got bagel chips. Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project. Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony. Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half. A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that? Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right? I get paid $40,000 per year. Maybe $50,000. No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500. Really? It was like amateur hour. I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs. No, that's... What? Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know? It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok. Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye. Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall? You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease. I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you. Look at that. Nice! Can't b*at a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself. Oh, look at that. [pushing bike] Smooth roll. You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike! Nice. Oh, god! What? [everyone finishes listening to song] Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar? You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and- Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay? So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can. Stop it! It's gonna be great. And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it. Hola. Que tal? No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me. Night, everybody. Thanks! Public School, at exit 11. Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination. How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days? Oh. [walking down the runway] Raaah! [waves sword] Wait, wait. She hasn't moved in awhile. You could feed the hungry. Us. Really? [cheers, applause] Thank you. All right. Okay... Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it! You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from... [changes channel during commercial, sports scores appear on screen.] Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores. We're behind. I wasn't recording it. Wait, why do you have to record it? Oh, God. Hold on to your wallets, ladies. Fun, communication, connection. Well, it's tight, as with any start-up. I'm sorry, nine days until what? Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend? [gasps] No, no. That is right now. In terms of land, not population. No, no you're wrong about this. I'm on it Jim. I'm on it. Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael. Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order. I have a computer question. Hey Oscar? Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael? Try 'Control P'. Oscar it must be k*lling you to know that Michael is smarter than you. I said see you later building. Hey. Mmm. Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Did you know, that China has a new m*ssile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast? China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us. How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%? Reply it! Yeah, I figured that. Wait. You forgetting something? Here we are. I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to b*at China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation. Raise your cups on high. Case closed. Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that. Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes? I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator. I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena. Oh, that would be impressive... ifanyoneknew what a comptroller was. Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so... Hi. Oscar. A pleasure. Merry Christmas. And Merry Christmas. Wow, that's awesome! You are. You make your own drink. [Ryan groans] An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters. Make time for romance! My boyfriend. No! You can't have any candy! K-a. "Ka"? What does "ka" mean? Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing "moo", I'm playing "milk". Whatever it takes. Uh... Like the cow mood yesterday. God. The cow jumped over the moon. That brilliant little b*tch. Wait. Why? I think there's better... You could have just told us what you were thinking. There's no yelling in that, either. Maybe. Only maybe. Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself. Yes. Apoplexy. No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married. Cute. [enters office area] Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good. But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line. What's it say? Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island. Yeah? Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for. Seriously? Go get 'em. Start quipin'. Umm... "You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here." Ha. Tasteless? Yes, well done! Oh. [rubbing hands with Holly] Are these numbers correct? Okay. Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out. I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA. Uh-huh. No one is more thrilled for them than I am... Obviously, so happy for them both. No, stop! Just don't. Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem. So we kiss occasionally. Okay. Fine. No more PDA. Anything goes. I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it. Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! [claps] Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend! I do. Suck it, Oscar. This must k*ll you. Congratulations. I am sorry that I have to do this... [starts choking Oscar to death with his towel] [muttering] Sometimes you over react. Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh? Michael, she's perfect for you. I had a great idea until you ruined it. Dallas indeed. Yeah. I saved 3 years salary. No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect. That guy's got more than he can handle as it is. Did that? Did that just happen?! [runs after Michael] We should.. we should write a movie or something! I'm serious! It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice. You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something. I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go! [throws sandwitch into Kevin's open mouth] No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. [disgusted comments by co-workers] No body go in there. Stay where you are. Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning! [laughing] I'm here. [DeAngelo gasps and turns around] In a good way! I've been here the whole time. I watch you when you sleep. No it's not. You gotta play along man. [quietly groans] Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. [takes a sack tied in the upper middle making a crude head, with a face drawn on, obviously the product of poor craftsmanship, Oscar pretends to like it] How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator. Mmhmm, bravo! [Andy walks by with DeAngelo, says quietly after he leaves] Walk away b*tch. My last pay check? No. Don't thank me! Hey, don't thank me, guy! Okay? And I don't care if you like it. Oscar? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation...All but Aah! Aah! It's so loud! [scatting off-key] Something's definitely wrong. Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD. Seven, two... Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief] Okay. [looks ashamed] The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid. And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids. Did you see him at a bathhouse? The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins. Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there. You're in the gay mafia. No. Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. [smiles] You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while. No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat. Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise. Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot. She does seem happy. [hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh! I've been turned into a puppet! Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?... So now anyone gets to talk at any times? What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed] Yes. What a surprise! Minorities sticking together. Oh, for God's sake. [notices Erin planking on parking lot curb] Yeah, she does like Elmo. Bye. Yeah, alright Kev why don't you come with us? No, he's fine. I mean, he's gotten worse over the years.... I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties...and tie clips. Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? [To Oscar] What do you think, C-SPAN? [interrupting] I'm afraid you've lost my interest. This is what's under the blanket. Ooooh! ....back orders and you never called them. There's a dog in the car. Do Snowboarders hate animals? Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time. Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Alright! Nice job, Oscar! So...ah, who's gonna take the dog? What if he jumps out the window and runs away? Whoa! Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog? When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ... playing my birthday. We're lookin' at at least one su1c1de and one weird sex thing. I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement] Are you volunteering? Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy. Definition. Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong? Oh, he's plenty strong. It's simpler this way. I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up. How's it going over here, guys? Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table. Well, technically FOR Andy. I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too. Rosebud? I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed. Um, cheeseburger. Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour. Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello. I'm only scared of real things like serial K*llers and kidnappers. Not things that don't exist like ghosts or mummies. Pam do you think anyone's going to notice I've worn this costume before? When I wasn't pregnant. You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits. The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement. The most well known film in the genre is an hour long sh*t of a squirrel with diarrhea. What's the story? How did you get in my car? This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me. Oscar, use a calculator. [Oscar shakes head] You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right? Six-seventy, six-twenty. yes! What does this mean? What does it mean! No! In the box. [hits it straight into the floor] Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'- I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha! [laughing and drinking Brandy] Haho! It's going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office. It's going to be good to have someone hot at Pam's desk huh? I'm kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She's obviously super cute I get it. But I'd like to point out there's 50 pounds more of me to love if that's your thing. Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you're saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman. Yeah. Drive carefully! Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil w*r. Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written. The truth. Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed. Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this- Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil w*r? No! No, it was not! No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern? Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle! Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut? Yes. I am an accountant. Really? Schrute Farms did you say? That is a fascinating little chapter of the Civil w*r. [on film] You have to understand. Poets, artists, dancers – these kind of men preferred peace to w*r. These delicate lovely men found a place of refuge among the Schrutes at Schrute Farms. Amidst the macho brutality of w*r this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight. I like to think of Schrute Farms as the Underground Railroad for the sensitive... and well... fabulous. I've seen enough. Oh yeah? Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion. We have a gym at home. It's called the bedroom. [sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away. Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?Andy/ I am not asking, I am ordering. No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing. [grabs phone] Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle? That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle? Is that ladle stainless or... Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup. [Jim chuckles] Aw, let me see- How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you? Yes! Yeah! [laughs] I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though. Dwight. Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it's a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like... What? Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar, you're in charge of the bar. [yawns, "Idiot" is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin? Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper. Books! Excellent, Jim. Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to "play ball." Those were his words. So make that error! Hey! I can make that error. It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say? Oh. What? It's a command. You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you. I've got a quota to h*t. I don't care how I h*t it. Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay? No. Nah. It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. [Oscar's friend walks up] Not anything. Aesop's? This 2001 masterpiece from Gilles Paquet-Brenner explores the intricate dynamics of a family in disarray. The Einsteins win it! [applause] [Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though. Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool? [Robert laughs] Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me? Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you're simply a penis, a vag*na, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a Pilates studio. Wine collection. [laughs] About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers. Good night. To the kitchen. Onward! Note? It's a symphony. Bears. And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like. Ah, no. Right month, wrong year. Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work. Everyone, our very own Angela- I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants. Yes? Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here? Phillip is so fat. [sighs] I don't even know what the truth is anymore. Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many dr*gs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring? Aw, preemie pajamas! I got Little Kevin Call of Duty. Shh. It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio. Really? Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago. The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata. Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock. And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious. Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe? Okay. [sits] Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now. So don't. What? How long before? Damn girl! Your body! Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back. I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons. Stop. Stop it Andy. Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it. So cute. That is where we disagree. Angela is such a liar! It's maddening! No one said "you must have two" Unbelievable! Stop it. One order. How you doing, Val? [Val and Brandon kiss] Oh no, I'm not actually Jamaican. Thank goodness he was there. Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don't want to leave yet. I haven't had so much fun since seeing... zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun. What if you're being att*cked by a 4'11" man who is penisless? What? Poor Andy! First you got b*at up by a g*ng, and now she kicks your ass? I don't... I don't... If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure? You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the "treasure box" and slams it down on Dwight's desk] I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees] I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone. Did a good job, Buddy. Now it's time to come home. Yeah he does. None taken. Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans] I know, right? It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party. Pam, we have a great idea. I knew she'd cr*ck! I wanted to leave you out, you know. What are you talking about? Yes we can. Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult. This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent. Why thank you. Oh, the plants are gonna love this. Tell me about it. It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male. What are you doing? Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is. Oh, no, no, no. This poem would crush you! Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing? Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people... You know, Oscar, I really had no idea you were so passionate about animals. really? Well, if you want to get involved, call me. This is my cell. I'm more likely to pick up night, say after 9... Excuse me. [Walks away.] [waiter is cracking pepper into Andys salad] Oh, yes indeed... When! [Waiter begins walking away.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] When! Oh my god! Wait, what? Come on! Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter? I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes! Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.] Or you proved that he thinks you're gay. Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar. sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here. Oscar! It was lovely! And don't forget to call. Robert?  Oh. ...with you. [chuckles] Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam. I'm throwing out all my mirrors. No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist- Put some ice on it. Oh, Andy. I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back. Hey. You didn't call. Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I'm not that good at puzzles. Oscar, Oscar, will you take him? If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person. Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn't given me a definite yes or no. [bleeding heavily from the mouth] That's not true. Just give me another chance. No, the baby. Please, it's my husband's favorite cat. He's broken up about it. It's the only time I've seen him cry other than our wedding night. Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you! Please don't teach the cat French. That Clark, huh? Errr [punches palm] Ca! Who was Pam's first celebrity crush? Yeah. News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy. Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride. Whhooooo! [laughs] What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it. [chuckles] I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! [Mimicks smacking everyone with a whipl]. Why? Is it employee's day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays. No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it's not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it. Might've done. And how... do you figure? You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.[ringtone of Dixie plays] Okay, Kevin did that. I do not wish I was in Dixie.[answers phone] Hey mom, how are ya? Did any Bernards ever own a plantation in the south?[to the group] She said no! Take that![gets back on phone] Follow up question. Did any Bernards, ever, make money, in an unsavory way?[speaks quietly into the phone] I just asked you! Why didn't you just say that?[continues speaking quietly] Oh, stop! Stop! Stop talking! Stop taking! That's—no! I don't wanna know that. Ok. You're interrupting a meeting I have to go. Love you. Bye.[faces the group] Well, turns out the Bernard's of yore did not own slaves. Fail. I'd like to take a solemn moment to remember Jerry in the warehouse who passed away this year.[Screen flashes 'FAIL' over Jerry's face, accompanied by fart noise, repeats twice.]Well, that's all folks.[photo of Andy watersking shows on screen]Ski ya later everybody. Thanks for a great season. [Group claps halfheartedly] [Gasps] Oh my god! [on phone] There are a hundred packs.. Shh! Ninety nine cases..yeah. Wh... 314 pies. Dwight, what the hell? We bonded. We got to- [Dwight starts dropping into the bus on top of Jim] I insult you, Oscar. I insult you! To your face! Then why don't you do something about it? Role call. And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway... Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator? So Oscar, you're a dinosaur. God, it's just so good to see you.  [to camera crew] Can you guys come with me for a minute? Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so, [bleep] him. That's beautiful. No, I totally get that. I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that. Sounds great. What does that mean? That doesn't surprise me. The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out. [Getting up to leave] I can't, it's too much! [laughing] [holding hand over phone] This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me. Yeah. Kevin. His gambling problem must've resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation. [on phone] Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion? Hi. Oscar, we're in the middle of talking. What are you doing? How? So you set him up. I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible. A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler.. I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict. Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information. I just had a little intuition that someone I loved needed a little bit of attention today. Oscar, you're looking very healthy. Getting lots of vigorous exercise? [touches Oscar's shoulder. Oscar jumps away quickly] What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't mean any offense. I was just trying to be friendly. It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A! U..s..a. U- Hi. Spring cleaning? [whispering] I think the senator is having an affair. I think the senator is having an affair. When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile. And he's always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it's Hot Yoga with Blake. I don't know. Right. Right? What? Which one is the instructor? There all fatties. Where? Oh my God! She's so stunningly tiny! She's like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they're doing. [gasps] I've heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I'd like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let's go. Ow. [whispering] Okay, we should go now. Let's go. Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can't get enough of the show? Your jollies are all on f*re -- What? Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay? Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing? [ducking under table with Oscar] Oh. Oh.  Yesterday, Angela may or may not have figured out that I'm having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she's cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it's business as usual. Oscar... [sighs] can I ask you a question? Is it cool in here to you? I think the thermostat is acting up again. Thank you. No, thank you, Angela. How much wine do you have? Oh, thanks, Oscar. You're such an angel. Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me. Come -- come with me. There's no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps. What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who's the father of her child? I'm sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, I'm gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- Stop! No! If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend. See ya later, Trevor. I just saved your life. You're welcome! You deserved every bit of it!  You made my husband gay. No. No. Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you. God! [kicks Oscar] You were supposed to be my friend. Don't blame me for something we all forgot. Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot. Please just take my name off of everything. This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces. No. Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia? You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year [looks over at Angela, then back to Oscar]...as impish! [Smacks Oscar with a stick][Angela smiles smugly] Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault. [checking Oscar's head] Oh yeah, big time lice. Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos. Oh. Okay. Oh, thank you. Oscar, do you want to be my partner? Oh God. Stuck with the weirdo. Wow. He got to purple. Sorry. Hey, did Erin already take off? Hey! Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that's Italian. Always with the friends Oscar. Can't we just enjoy the new espresso machine? Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose. Ahh... Taste test? I'm in! What? [everyone is confused] Yeah, we're aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it. Yes! Three... Four! It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here. Actually... You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I'll take one too. Frickin' A! So long, noise! And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we're going to be in so much trouble! [reluctantly] Everybody dance now... [Darryl continues singing] You shut up! Hey, it's five o'clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot] An "X." What? Well, I'm heading out to Cece's dance recital. This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want. Yeah right. With slammin' bods like that, they ain't playing checkers. Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that [picks up piece of paper]. Okay.[sound of applause on phone] Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off. This is not natural. But it's Dwight who's bring in all the weirdos. No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about. What? I'm his! His... wife. Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage. Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question. [at Phillip's party] Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck. He even looks like a mole. Yes. We're good friends. Good friends. You know, I suppose that may ruffle a few feathers. For a long time, our party has turned it's back on the Hispanic people. Well, that is not who I am. [puts arms around Oscar] I am a friend of the Latino community. And if you ask me, it's time we bid bigotry hasta luego. [guests laugh] Now, does my embrace of Hispanics make me more electable? Given demographic trends? I don't know. And I don't care. What I care about is Oscar. [slaps Oscar's cheek] My friend. Mi amigo. Oscar. [guests applaud as he hugs Oscar] LaShawn. Great. You wanna be in a photo? Right this way. [notices overweight man following] Not you. No. Let's just wheel Margaret right in front... Thanks so much for coming. Thanks so much. [to Oscar and Angela] Well. Have we all calmed down yet? It's what I do. [everyone begins to leave] No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that. Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship. No. No discount for two men. Two men are not a couple. I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something. For two hours? Really? Wow, that's wonderful! I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen. Andy! My grandfather know. Mah Jong will be here to stay. Hobbies of the East continues in a moment. You could all be doing this, just saying. Why can't you just do regular sit-ups? Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now? Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis] [after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right. Excuse me? OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face] [at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here? [smirking] Oh, yeah. Jeb, my brother. You were the aunt to my cousins. Most of your life you were 5'4", at the end you were 5'1". Hey. Dwight's sister. Yeah. We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness. No! [Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song? Oh, I don't care. What was that word they said when they showed me "Skrald mand"? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up] What about me? "Klokken tre pige" What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they've just had sex] Oh! I didn't know they were filming then! There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am. No! Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping? Oscar. I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out. Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something] [Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator? Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! [Slaps Oscar] God! Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career. Call him! Call him! [hits Oscar] Call him! Call him! [On speakerphone] You've reached Senator Robert Lipton, please leave a message. [beep]Angela & Hi honey! No you go. Hi honey! It's Angela and Oscar. Just a few quick things. Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential. Yeah. Yeah! Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it. I think we're good. Bye! Come on! [claps] Come on. You got this. Here. Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in. [drinks a 5-Hour Energy sh*t and groans] Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn't know, you didn't know, and you didn't freaking know. But I knew! [claps] Yes, we did it! --with this new self-awareness, I was finally able to find love at long last. With my amazing... Chief of Staff Wesley Silver. Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator. Little raw. Not cool Oscar. Huh. Well, you know, you can't have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what's most important. That's my new thing. Two sacks' worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house. And they're gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone. Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I'm taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever. What? So, all the numbers adding up? He was good. Night, Oscar. Well, I've changed my mind. Oh, god, could you just mind your own business? Oh, god. You don't want me at your place. Well... Thank you. Okay. Are you allowed to have pets? So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross? I wouldn't know. I never lived with a gay guy. [starts sobbing] I love him. Mama! Ok, coming. Hi, baby. Angela's divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it's Angela who's living in the closet. Hey-o. Daycare won't take Phillip anymore. Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won't forgive. So, hi. Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard's. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions. Why didn't you pack the apple snacks? Guys.Angela & Not now, Kevin. Can't you see we're busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks. Maybe forever. Anyhow— What? I'm moving the ink down in my pen, for work. Don't tell me what to do!Angela & Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true. All right. He does have a gift. Run, old man! Run! Run! Run for your life! Get off. Don't you dare. Don't get—I could see it. You were gonna get handsy with me. Not interested. I'm Casey Dean! You'll be seeing the last of me. Er, I meant you won't be seeing the last of me! [addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you. Can't hear you. I'm giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored? Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes. Phillip got this for me? Whoa. No, Kevin, no. Whoa! I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I'm gonna miss these guys. See you guys at Poor Richard's, all right? Okay, bye. Bye, Phillip. High five. Are you sure you don't want me to drop him off? All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye! No one is ready for this. You can't be ready for this. We don't even know what this is. Based...on his merit. After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. [pause] Not really my scene. Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It's..it's all over the place. I don't know what it means. Andy? Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo's here. Let's do this. Change if you need to. Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy. Woah-Oh! Haven't been in one of these in forever. They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a cliché. I'm a man. So I'm going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out. Private Room. Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success. That's how I got my new job in the admissions office. You're telling me! Oh, great. He's getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung. I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I'd love to contribute to your campaign. I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I'm exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I'm still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they're the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that. Oscar. Oscar. [crying] I think I'm gay. [sniffles] It's just that I'm so emotional. No, but maybe the reason... Based...on his merit. After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. [pause] Not really my scene. Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It's..it's all over the place. I don't know what it means. Andy? Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo's here. Let's do this. Change if you need to. Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy. Woah-Oh! Haven't been in one of these in forever.

[sniffles] It's just that I'm so emotional. No, but maybe the reason... Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar] What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that? Angela? Ok, I have an announcement. I can also take 3 people. Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground? Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat. On your left! So we've got what, another 20 minutes? Yes, Michael, they do. Yes, sir. Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake. Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland. Really? Alright who wants to party? Oscar, talk to him. You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza? We think it's a straight forward kidnapping. Why can't you guys do it? I stole it! No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word. I can't believe he has a second job. Hey, hey, hey. Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems? Exactly. I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY! I didn't say it, I declared it. Still, that's not anything. Yeah, tell me about it. You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine. Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic. I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together. I got game. Mm-hm. That is so cool how you have my name at the top. Right. Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background] Angela. No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this. We will find another way, we'll ask power-point. You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this. No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half. We really did. It was fun. [on phone] Michael, how did this happen? Where did all your money go? I don't, I don't get this. I really don't. I don't know how you could be so irresponsible. I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really. I don't know what more to say. [on phone] Yeah, what? [on phone] Okay, where did he go? [on phone] Well, is he coming right back? Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food. In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food. I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face] Oscar, did you bring it? Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware. Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club. We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way. Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful. There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed. It's very exclusive. I think I cut my penis on the lid! [joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit. It just- [Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine] To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh... Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer. Very brave choice also, I thought. [Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us. Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I. Of course I read it. [flashback to Oscar's birthday, hiding in the break room] Happy Birthday! You know, try sending them another invoice. Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way? Right? I was just thinking... I took an extra sh*t of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die. Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care. Yeah. [Jim enters room] Nature. We got our spaces back. I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness. Elliot. [on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it. Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow. [notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us. I... just... if they speak Spanish. Ohh... I love it more! No, okay... I've had enough of you. Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited! This is all we need. Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company... I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin. Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist. Mm-hmm. When you get a loan, you don't have to use it for exactly what you say you're gonna, right? No, but, I mean, once the bank gives you the money it is your money. You can use it for whatever you want, right? No, Kevin that would be fraud. Let's say you tell the bank that you're going to open up an ice cream store but instead you buy an ice cream cart? Technically you are still selling ice cream. Gambling debts? What? [outside the office with a cart, ringing a bell] Ice cream! Goooood ice cream! Oscar. No, I decided I would pay off my debts by selling ice cream. I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today. Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday. [forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks] Oh, thanks. I should check that out. Actually, I'm a lesbian. I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke. There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women. Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just-- I knew that. OK, bye. Oh, she's very beautiful. So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number. Damn it. Come on. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life. I haven't had a very hard life. Hey, hey! How do you know Michael Clump? How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people. Ahaha, Yep! [Dwight looks down depressingly and rubs his new goatee] Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call. I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so... [speakerphone] Hi everyone! No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies. It's part of the ethics thing. I'll drop an ethics b*mb on you. Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom! Anybody? This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions. Stanley? Oscar, come on. Yeah, [interrupting gibberish]. Come on, anybody. Let it fly. I know, Kevin. And this is way worse than the stroller she came with. I'm done. Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000. Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector. How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk. Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days. Thank you Michael, thanks, thanks everybody. I'd like to auction off a weekend at my place in Martha's Vineyard. Hey, hey! ... Yeah. Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you [points at Jim] if you hadn't forgotten French. Where is my numbers man? That's really good. [offers mimosa to Oscar] [whisper] Hey... guys, check it out. My own personal DVD player and 20 movies. Shhhh! Keep it down. [going up escalator in the hotel] This is nice. This is nice. Move in here. Very sweet... ah. Engaging wings [imitates mechanical sound] Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez. Works in accounting. This is uh, concierge Marie... And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night--- Alright, I've scoped out the joint. Those two dudes are as good as naked. You'll thank me when they spank thee. Gentleman. [walks away] Unbelievable! Unbelievable. Anything. You can ask me anything. I'm your wingman. Right-o. What? What do I see in Angela? I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle. She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that. And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have sex with her. No. Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for. What is wrong with her? I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her? What is wrong with you? That was fun last night. You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada. You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards. [Oscar laughs] Totally. [continues laughing] What--- Who? We called Angela? That was real?! I thought I dreamed that. Oh, God! Oh, God! So bad! Oh man, she is so pissed. [sitting down by Oscar] She's taking us back to first base. I get to kiss her forehead. [looks at Oscar] I had a good time hanging out this weekend. You up for a chest bump? Definitely we should. That is just obnoxious. Yeah. Wait, what, the mess or the note? Mmm... okay. Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old. Yes. There's the x-a*...icks. Mmhmm, okay. Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five. Ho-oh! Yeah. I'll be six. So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus. [whistles poorly] Whoo. No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better? [over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good... Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands. The b*lls on you, man. Well that never happened. I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair? [through the laughter] Oh, is somebody making fun of me? I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly. I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing. Do I know what? Yeah, know what? Right. Because that is how my mind works. I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less. So what's it gonna be? Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me. Hey. What? Sorry. Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly. [mimicking] What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it-- Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church? I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number. Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number. [to Dwight] Are you still having intercourse with her? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes'] Did you ever have intercourse in this office? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes'] Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What? How about, "I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?" I knew something bad was gonna happen today. Fine! Where are you? Why isn't Dwight turning around? Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture. [surprised] Wait, what? This is ridiculous. Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can... Oscar! Pull me up! What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other... Si senor. [giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God... Pow pow pow... [hands making g*n impression, sporadic clapping] [in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles] I'm almost done. Are you alright? Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela? [Angela raises her hand] Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are... [Stanley is laughing] Oscar, you're gay. Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking. ... Okay, let's go. It... yeah. For a cat? I could get you a kid for that. I have something better than a picture. Come on. I can do this. Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying] Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer] [gasps] [cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now. This is getting weird. [shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time? [sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth] Take a nap! Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex. [Kelly looks hurt] Okay, sorry, let's, who else? Oscar. Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest. Nobody asked, Bob! Oh God, what did you do? I mean, not that I approve of any of it but... Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story. Really sad. My worst breakup was actually two breakups. Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me. No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio. John Mark and John David. Alright who's next? Where's Andy? What? Is somebody after you? Oh, not likely. 3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up. Hey, if anybody wants to go... You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit. Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a h*t is ten percent of our Blue Cross account? Yeah? Yeah. Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't f*re all of us, right? No, they can't. Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about. May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight. Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that. Okay, so. I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken! So I have to take the normal door. You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it. [feeding coins into a vent] I think it's 75 cents. I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it b*at me like that wireless router did. [bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it] I made it sterile. I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me. No, no no. Okay. Okay, hey, you already have the job. You don't have to convince me. I think he's singing. ... and I feel free! Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the? Hey dude, you know what a "rundown" is? "Uh, can you get this rundown for me?" [impersonating Charles] "This rundown better be really good"? Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients. No. I can't. It was like, hours ago. Oscar, what were you going to say? When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately. Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink. Urine. It was urine. I could loan you a pair of socks. No, they're clean. I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later. A bunch of prudes. You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals, but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes? [pulls down dress, office gasps] Is that how it goes? Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you. I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see. Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry. Ashley! You made it! Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that? Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug] Because if we don't play, then the other team wins. Yeah. This looks ok. [to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him? [to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay? And? Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay? [scoffs and chuckles] No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, [long pause] I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like. Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive? It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario. Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay. If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward? Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit. [knock at Michael's Office door] Yeah? Yes, Oscar come on in. Close the door if you would. Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me. I'm going in for a procedure today. Yeah, it's routine. I'm just a little bit scared. It is a colonoscopy. In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? [Oscar looks irritated and frustrated] Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry? My main concern, should I have a safe word? Can I also be a boss? Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults. But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises? Ooh, easy. That's not it at all. What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?! What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?! Totally! ...when he was telling us his dumbass plan. Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? [all say yes] Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do. Nope. I'm numbering the paper. Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table] That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces. What does a bean mean?! Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor. She thought I was your boyfriend. Oscar, it was an honest mistake. Yes. It's a good idea. [sees Kevin's toupee] Oh my God. Yes. I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee. Who would want it? I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space. All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation. He did talk about a f*re in the warehouse... and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer. Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around] [groans] Oh no. Fabulous. It's John Gotti, you idiot! Yeah. It's pretty close. Hello? Oscar! Uh, what is going on? Hey Oscar. It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon. Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us. If the salad is on top, I send it back. I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone. Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you. Oh you don't know about jail? Oh you would love jail. Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away? Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing? Very close. Yes. Yes! Thank you, welcome to my personal hell! Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for. Hey. [walks up to Oscar and hands him a report to sign] [in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going? Oh, well, thanks Oscar. I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom? Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection. I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story. Alright. Just, write it down, please. Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer. [watching Angela eat something] Enjoying your nut? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this. Open QuickTime. Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom! Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it. [as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what's up lifeguard? What's going on in here? My money's on Pam. Michael could win. Oh, the Wall. Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs. Oh, that sounds awful. [looks at Oscar who is using his phone, grabs it] Well, well, well. What is this contraption, I do declare? I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin. Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone. And she might be a m*rder. What does that mean? [accent] Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son? This here's Savannah. Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here. I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin. Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the b*llet points. Well, could you condense it please? It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows. [others start raising their hands to be picked] Mmm... whoa. I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy. Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line. I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one. [from behind the door] Is there internet? Tell them what you told me. This is genius. Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all - It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them. That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better. O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing? Wow, man. That - That was embarrassing. For me, too. You embarrassed me. Hey buddy, so every- Huh? What? It is time to unveil the tree. Hey Santa! You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box! Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny. [she walks over to see Oscar at the window looking down on man catching a football in parking lot] I think my water just broke! Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted! Hey. Uh, Matt is on a delivery. Just leave it here, I'll take it. Matt's a pretty good-looking dude, don't you think? Have you talked to him? Matt? Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right? Nice to meet you Oscar. It's Matt. [clapping] I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? [points to Oscar] Impossible. He opened it like an ape. [Pam and Oscar are trying to repack cardboard box] Yep, yep. Yep. We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks. La la la, hello Oscar! What are you reading? Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again. Why, is there an untapped gay market? ...Where did you get that information. Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you. Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital? You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital? Thank you! Thank you! You know it doesn't have to be an invention. Oscar, h*m* accountant. Oh I'm in. Drinks are on me! Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So... [Jim gestures for her to continue] Alright, alright. [chanting continues] One more, one more! [cheers and applause] Wow. [applause] Hey, Oscar. You're here early. No, you don't. I don't know. I'm free. If you hear of anything going on, let me know. Yeah. Hey, what's up? Thanks, it's cool. So... Has that ever happened? Ever? You want me to invite Matt? Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me. Happy hour. My pleasure. All right. My brother, good head, bad heart. Good head, bad heart. Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right? Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common. Hey, what's up? Anyone up for some hoops? Let's do it. This is awesome! Good work, buddy. That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please. Well, I know. [stammers] Just want... I mean... [chuckles] It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened. But you're an accountant too. La telefona. El telefono. Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific. [clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el! I think we could. [Donna giggles] Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes. It is totally insane. Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective. Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off. Mm. Curve the b*llet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted. Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo! I'm an awful guy! Ooh! Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site. Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer? Well... I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody. I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know. Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man? Did you have a good weekend going there? Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. [to Mr. Brown] Oh, hey! This is Oscar--- Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian. Two fifteenths. Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on. Oh, yeah... Wow. Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right? Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive? Well, it has certain connotations. Like... I don't... I don't know. No. Now, remember that honesty... So I can lower it. Kevin! That's inappropriate. It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune. OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right? It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him? Do you think we should go ? What is he doing? I don't know. Well, what? You could be referring to anything. Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up? Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on? What? Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here. No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25. I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so... I know... Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um... No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape? How many miles did he do last year? Divorce. Um... OK, "Meredith is so old..." That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me. OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25. I want it to be like... "Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous." "Well, guess what, [whispering] that was Michael Scott." "But it was anonymous, how do you know?" "Because I'm him." Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else? Hey, what a game, huh? What a game. You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy. Michael has tapedeveryDundies awards and now, he's making me look through hours of footage to find highlights. "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you. You're just a name and number and no one even says hello." [to Ryan] Card! Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter? [points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean? Wait a minute, what is this? What? Really? Oh! Youplay that. Go! Go! Go! Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch. [hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done. Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto. Do not panic. Go in single file lines. Pam. Hey. [looks to Oscar] Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day. Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department... ... that has three people... ... doing the work that could be done by two. Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most. Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just... What? No... Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me. A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface? I heard they made out and had sex. Try "profits". No! Try "Michael Scott". "Michael" "boss" and "funny". [Sadiq (IT guy) types; result pops up] Oh my God, wow! [chuckles] E-mail from Stanley. Stanley, Terribly nice guy. [reads e-mail] "Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late." Well, Stanley's an ass. Not one of our harder workers. Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy! What other ghost stories do you have for us? That I'm a robot? [robot voice] I will destroy everything in my path- Beep! Bop! Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk. [Tin Man voice] Oil can. Oil can. Alright. Oscar, got big plans tonight with- I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did. Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever k*lled anybody.Kevin & I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that. First present, Oscar. Oh, good, that was from me. Well, I call it fun! Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn. Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me! Oh, hey. Listen up. We're going to Poor Richard's. Who's in? Yes. Leader... ship. The word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership," as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork! Hey, Oscar? I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok. The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow. Ok, let him know that I'm here. What difference does it make whether your here? Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather? Really? Oh, that is a shame. You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic. What are your symptoms? Umm, hmmm. Checks out. I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday. Unless you're still sick. So have a great long weekend. Gil. Hey guys. Ahem. What's up? Maybe! Well, yeah. [to Oscar] Who do you think did it? Alright. Whose it from? [to Oscar] Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um... He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing. [laughs maniacally] Yeah. Yes! Well hi Chet. So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you. You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend. Mmm. Right. So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin! Oscar... Birthday party subs! My gift to you. Have you ever taken any illegal dr*gs? Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some dr*gs in your system without you knowing about it? Have you ever... pooped... a balloon? [opens eyes wide in total surprise] Company policy. If dr*gs are found on the premises there is a*t*matic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours. No, not at all. Um... let's um, let's keep our clothes. What's the problem? It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace. So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating? No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose. Come on, seriously, that? Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win. How about, I leave it up? Win. Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America. Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts. Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go. I have an ace. Okay. So what is it that you wanted to talk to me about? But... I guess that's it. So, call me when you have news. Okay? Michael said to stop by on your way out. [door bangs] Are we absolutely sure it's not an accounting error? That's a very nice watch, Oscar. I've never seen it before. He must have d*ed very recently. Yeah. We're missing $3,000 and we're trying to figure out where it went. Michael is the obvious suspect, but he is the boss, so we have to at least pretend to ask other people first. I knew it. Well, about three months ago, I was on a sales call and I broke the heel on my shoe and I only had the corporate card. I'm really sorry. $14. $3,000? That wasn't me. Don't yell at me. Gosh, I don't think so. Oh, we know you did... or someone else did. Oh, I love Red Stripe. Yeah. We should go out and get a beer after work. Or, hey, you want to go right now? Yes. I'm a single mom. I would never do anything to jeopardize my kid. My ex-husband took Wendy, the good one. We're in the process of interviewing everyone in the office. I think it's kind of fun. It's a great chance to catch up with people. I'll tell you what, if I find out who did it, I will shake their hand, pat them on the back, give them 72 hours to get out of the country, and then I'll let you know who it is. Is there anything else? I don't know. Why? What's going on? Why? All right. I've never seen it. Kevin, it's really bad.[ The Accountants, Webisode 05 - "Someone in the Warehouse" ] Yeah, I do think it's someone in this office, which really breaks my heart, to tell you the truth. Because I thought we were all good people here. Who? Kevin, cut it out! No. Well, he keeps the key behind his computer... Oh, Roy, one more question. What do you think of Angela? But you can if you want to. But you don't have to.[ The Accountants, Webisode 06 - "The Memo" ] It obviously isn't Dwight because he has the most integrity of anyone in the office. [both Oscar and Kevin glance over to the camera] What? Did you talk to Kelly? I talked to Creed, and he said he didn't do it. And then he tried to sell me dietary supplements. We are missing $3,000. Things are getting tense. Okay. Yeah. 'Cause I'm telling you that I didn't. My friend gave it to me. Diane... Chester... Snydburgh. You guys, this is stupid, that we're turning on each other. That is exactly what they want us to do. Yeah, we know. Basically, we're convinced that Michael took the missing $3,000, so we're waiting until he leaves his office so we can go in and search for evidence. When I say it out loud, it really doesn't seem like a good idea. I think you're mean. What are you doing tonight? Wanna get a beer? What are you doing? What happened to your old wok? Thank you. That was uncomfortable. [imitating Animal House's Bluto] Get it? Don't touch anything. You'll leave fingerprints. Awesome. Do you think this thing is worth $3,000? It's cool. Okay, this drawer is locked. Oscar, do you have a key? He has a snow-globe drawer. I like it. No. Well, it's about to be shut off. Okay. This is pointless. Someone just has to talk to him.Kevin and And here. Well, Dwight says that Michael didn't take it, but frankly, I think he's hiding something. [clears throat] What? You did? Where? Excuse me? Well, that doesn't sound like me. Absolutely not. Very well. Case closed. Very well. Listen man, I am so sorry. I had no idea. No. No it's not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people "f*ggie" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude. [in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much. That is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you. The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays. Ah damn pop-ups. We're all h*m*! h*m*. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people. I mean anybody could be gay. Business-men. Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here. However you want to do it. Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you. I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them. Well, I just like to look good OK, so --- No, I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero! Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag. You misunderstand-- OK. You know what, OK. I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is. You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend --- ...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me! All right, um... sorry. Oh, there's Gill. Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows? [reading the note with the gay-dar] "Hope this helps. -Jim" Nice! [singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door] But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits. Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation? Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left. Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee? Yeah. No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations. Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy... just... there's something about him that creeps me out. I can't really explain it. He's always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for "being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me." I don't understand how someone could have so little self-awareness. No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific. No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga. Are you enjoying your fiesta? So does this remind you of your childhood right now? A good manager doesn't f*re people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business. This is culture to you? Yeah, on Van Gogh's first try, he drew the hands of the peasants. Meaning, real art takes courage, okay? And honesty. No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes. Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight. You saw it? Describe it please. Oh... Nice. [Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten. There's like ten green ones. We have a lot of angry customers out there. This puts us at thr*at level midnight. Accounting, you are on customer service duty today. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people. But guess what? From now on, you guys are no longer losers! So give yourselves a round of applause. [Kelly and Kevin clap] [on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point. I'm sorry. No, I amsosorry. Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations. Oooh, yes. Facial. You two are apes. Still said it. Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume? Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. [everybody sits down on beach] OK, everybody up! Circle 'round. [motions for circle to form] Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor. Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! [contestants start walking] No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready? Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day. All right. [smiles] No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me. No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo. Why? But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk] No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael. Dwight is our new boss. I think it's gonna be Michael. No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one. Excellent question, Pam. 1/100th of a cent. HEY! COME ON! Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam]
