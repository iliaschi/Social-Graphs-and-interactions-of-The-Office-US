[sighs] You interviewing for the sales job too? Well, I wouldn't be so sure about that. I mean, I've been working here 12 weeks. That's a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we've seen. Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl. Hey. Come on, buddy. Let's do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don't compare. When you're with the R-O-L-F, you're literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs] I'm just gonna call you back. Thanks.[Dwight knocking on desk] So I've got your resume here, but it's not telling me everything. Well, I'm the one offering the job. I've worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I'm an Assistant to the Regional Manager. Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I'm sure he'd give a reference. That seems inconsiderate. Well, my day's sh*t. Let's just go, you guys.
