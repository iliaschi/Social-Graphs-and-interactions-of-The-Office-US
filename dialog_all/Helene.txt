Looking at her mother on screen, horrified] Oh God... [looks at Michael] So good. It'll take a lot more than a b*llet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and b*lls to k*ll Michael Scarn. [phone rings] Hello? What, no. That can't...I don't... Well here's what I've been doing around here. It's for a series on exposure in the workplace. Hey! [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday. I think everyone has meet Helene. Shall we? Oh my God I love it. [looks at camera and shakes head] No, that wouldn't be-- Something's up. That paper was never supposed to arrive. Yeah-- it's exciting. Wow. Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it. Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day. So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year? That's funny. You're 54 years old. You're 58 years old? Mom, have you decided what you want to be called? I want you to be Grandma. Helene? I am. I'm definitely going to do it. I've already got the run and the bike thing down. Just need to learn how to swim. Come on, you in? So it's a matter of interest. Good, okay. It's not anything you would have ever done. Well there's no jumping in a triathlon. You're thinking of the broad jump. Would you try-- bungee jumping? Snowboarding? I might. Oh, no, no, no.

That's just an arbitrary title. Penny for your thoughts. It's not amazing... at all. It's sort of weird that I went and did that. And now your wish won't come true, so that blows. Oh that I plagiarized I think. Yeah. I think it sucks. Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It's a generational-- sort of gap between us. Cakes really good. Finish your cake, Helene. It's not my decision. It's mother nature. And mother has very strict rules about fer-- [waitress comes over to pour water; long pause] -- tility. I, um-- I got it. Hey, grandma's back. Oh, thank God. I haven't had caffeine in nine months. Where's the baby? I want to see the baby. Oh! Oh, Helene, hi. Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma. Hello. Oh, good for you. I worry about you. Okay.
