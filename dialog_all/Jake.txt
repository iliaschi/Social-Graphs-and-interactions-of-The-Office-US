I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, "muffin basket." Then I thought, "What's even more precious to people than muffins?" Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don't feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You're so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight's bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay? No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate. You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful. You can refer to me as Mister Schrute. Schrute. Mister Schrute. ...Okay. Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate... You serious? Uh, nope. Yes. That woman is not my mother. That is my step-mother. Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name. Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So... Oh... kay. Sure. You're welcome. It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see? Really? Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh? Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.
