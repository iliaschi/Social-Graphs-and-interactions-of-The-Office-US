No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge. Hi Donna. It's Michael. I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me. I can't even say it. H-I... No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right? Does your stupid husband have it? [vaudeville delivery] Yee. Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim. Did somebody order a hooker over here? Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today. Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister. All right. Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May. I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go! [Michael's picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen] Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white. And that would be a display [image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up] of the crisp, gorgeous black. This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before. Ryan. And that's it. That's me. That's who I am. Oh, thanks. [softly] You're not bad, either. Hmm. Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here. Just put it in your pocket.Michael and [tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy] Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility. So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller... Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints? I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those? They're good [Donna grabs mint] Sure. We should have your contract done by Thursday. Okay. Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too. I don't know. I think so. [whispers] Okay. So... Oh, Donna? Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate. Thank you so much. Mmm. [Donna giggles] [follows her out of office] Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have... All right. All right. Bye. And have a good elevator ride. [runs down to parking lot, sighs] You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette. Who? About what? No, no. No. [sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger. I work with Michael. Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands] [at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead. It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured] Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body? [moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse? Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right? to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I'll talk to you later. I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind. Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want. If you wanna dump me, I totally get it. Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs] ...poop my pants. Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water? We are? Oh, hey, I love your earrings. Did Michael get them for you? Where? Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where? Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place? So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong. Jim is her husband. I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out] [to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer? You know what? We should really do something fun this week. Wouldn't that be fun? How about Thursday? I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday? Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert. Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by. Nope, that's Tuesday. You're cheating. You're cheating on me. Who is he? The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?
