Streamers! [everyone throws streamers in the air and starts dancing] [goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing? Well, what if you're cold? Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear. [drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration. Wow, that's a lot of keys. That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back. I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope] Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer] What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life. Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us. Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke. Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you? Dwight is about to get so Pammed. Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on. There we go. Let's just calm down. I don't- Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God! Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds! Great. We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic... Is there really? Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea. Aaah! Wait. Is this your place Dwight? Yeah. These are actually forks and knives from the break room. And a soy sauce packet. Don't b*at yourself up. Who will be watching the children? Prove it. Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works. But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good. So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key. The mall itself or just the stores in the mall? Did something happen Dwight? Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board. Dwight? Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the "F" word? No you will not. Ok. So what happened? No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you. Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby. Pretty Woman. No, no. I want to hear you tell it. Agreed. Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching. Yeah, I liked them too. Say stuff like, "Good morning, Good Afternoon". People appreciate that. Please and thank you go a long way. Thank you. Wish us luck! [coughs for attention] My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit] Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it. Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that. Let me know if I can help you with anything. Yes? I remember, yes. I'm terribly sorry about that. We had a safety concern. Um... we very politely indicated that he'd be welcome back... If he were in accordance with our dress policy. But the blood stained hands... I'm very sorry. Lets just go. There it is. Alright. After you. Dwight? Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight. Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe. Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her. No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show. Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause. Do you want to re-mediate? Ooooh! [after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change. Oh, Dwight, just move. Come on, Dwight. These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car. That was more horrifying than Nunsense. Okay. No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted. No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times. Well, I won't tell if you don't. Good night, Dwight. I don't want to talk about it anymore. Hola amigo. Si, yo muy bueno worker. Scranton, y before that La Philadelphia. Yes, I'm really good at English. [quietly] Okay. [seeing the worker Dwight picked up in the parking lot] Who's this guy by our cars? Yeah, I got stung up my dress. Poor hornet. But if he doesn't? Uhh, beg your pardon? No. No no no! [nos coming from all employees] [picks up baseball bat, heads towards hornet's nest]Employees except No! No no! How did this happen, how did I get this? You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. [in pirate voice] It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port. Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her. Oh my God! What if I did? Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her. There's no way I'm gonna do that. [makes grunt in attempt to stop Dwight. Dwight hangs up] Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye! Michael... [Michael hangs up] Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial. Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call. [after long wait, to Dwight] Would you excuse us... Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column. You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She... No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there. Yes, I don't... I know, I know. Got it. Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene? What is happening? [Dwight shushes her] Jerk. [walks off] I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous. Herpes duplex. We were never lovers! Flower shops, fireworks celebrations... Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park... An electric car dealership. [Oscar gets up and starts leaving] She is a beaut! [chanting] Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Ow! [grunts, stumbles to his feet] You never forget. Whoo! Amazing. How do I look? Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go. Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after. He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash. I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining. Phoenix Sun's point guard? No? Nothin'? I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh. Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...[motions to lobby] Crap. Well, by worst, you mean the best. So, the situation is the worst. Ahhh. Okay, great- -I'm just gonna watch. Good to see you too. Oh, I'm just here for the coffee. Dwight! Yes. Yes! Nope, not doing that. And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now. Michael, I'm going with Danny. Thanks, Steve. No, I didn't. Oh, my god! I know how we can learn his tricks. Is that your office? Nope. Different movie. Meredith Van Helsing? Oh, no, no. No. Don't- Yeah, he is that good-looking. I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh? Oh! What do you mean? All right. I can do that. Then what? Yes. Exactly. You can do this. Who else we got? I'm goin 'in! Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well. It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it. Yes. No, you may not. I said no. No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us. Hmpf! Obviously. I don't even think she called me back. Dwight, please. Okay...that's different. Uh...I mean-yeah. Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine? Oh. [turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves] Stop. Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler. What? [laughs] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski? I don't know, they're both handsome. I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now. No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head. What is taking someone from behind? It was a good idea, though. This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book. [staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about? Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right? Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see. Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow] Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick. And get your flu sh*t. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office. Elaborate. I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that. So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you. [sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome. Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids. Thank you. Anyone else with a prayer or a remembrance? [Dwight and an eldery man stand up at the same time, Dwight stares at him, man sits back down] Try "Jesus." Hello. It's gonna be three months of hard work and when we're done, we'll practically be Quimixtanos. [overhearing Dwight's conversation] Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey. Are you kidding me? Stop it. Tell them that I'm in a meeting. No, you may not. They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out. Are you going? [to Dwight] I would watch that. [Pam in the background struggling with Cece] Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated. Maybe I should go. If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back. I can't even talk about it. I kind of doubt Gabe has suit. I don't know about, love... [whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes. No no no no no! She'll wake up! Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion? Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And- Absolutely! [starts out] What kind of pizza would you like? No! [runs off] That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me. Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it. Okay... [puts pizza into Dwight's mouth] What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us! You need to stop talking. Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight! [unbelievingly] Okay... No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela. The reverse cycling ends tonight! [Pam leaves] I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in] Nope. No. I'm trying everything. That's-- [ding] the password. We're in. Wow. Awesome. [out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality. Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it "Hay Place". Eldred Called it "Hay World". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it. Don't forget to make a broom. Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay. No, I meant... [motions you and me] Mm-Hmm. Perfect! Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back. Yeah! I wanna go on it again. Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks] Where have you been?! I've been waiting. I found the needle in the haystack! I don't know! Yeah. [Michael closes the door] And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let's hear it for... Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight's worker claps] Okay. I won't let you down. [Ryan goes back into his office and shuts the door] Why? Do you mind? You don't have to do that. [whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do. Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong. Well, A for effort right? Eight dollars? Yeah, right here. It is right there. [holds up magazine] Anybody read the news any more? Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply? Don't tell me how to do my business. Which is you. Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks. I'm not going to do that. Sure. [hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends. I don't know what the [expletive] that was. Dwight take it down. I'm serious, take it down or else. I went out to look for a better office space. Yup. Yeah, yeah. Totally. Oh, its on. Well, I wish for a million wishes. Then see you later building. I'm pretty good on politics. "California is bankrupt, and California, California." [Jim and Andy follow Michael into his office] What? I understand it, I can't speak it. You've been watering down the soap? We need everything back the way it was. [riding in car, looking for new office] Ten thousand seven hundred and six. Yeah. The building's underground? Pam. Pam? I'm Pam. No you're not. Oh, that's fine. I've been known to bend the truth. Okay. I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam. Yeah? I know, because you're the reason we're moving. Uhh, I think it's something like umm... Umm, let me see. Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet. Hello, hello. You're breaking the law. Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper. I don't think it goes that way. That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole... You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping? I am jumping. Yes, I'm jumping. Oh God. Hey, it's snowing. [Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs] Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right? Yeah, who's a little girl now? [everyone laughs] You've got something on your nose. No. That sounds awesome. Can we all do it? Pam? Pam? Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby! I don't know. You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree. [standing outside, dials Dwight's cell phone] [voicemail recording] You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.] Stop! Stop! Oh... oh! [grunting, shouting] I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it. That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I thr*aten to k*ll myself. Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop! Stop! Okay. Okay. Okay. Seriously! Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally] What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic. What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me. All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City. I haven't told you about her. Oh no, that's, that's not happening. Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought. [walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] "Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese." [opens the present and a snowball sh**t out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight! I surrender. Anything. You got it. You're a psychopath. What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim! Next up, secretary Schrute will read the minutes from Sunday's meeting. Oh. This meeting is for Knights of the Night only. I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on. Dwight, don't be bothered by your friend's presence. I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here. Sounds good. Smart. Go ahead and read it, some people weren't here. It was fun. Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board. They're so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put 'er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! That's a good firm handshake. You're hired! Yes, let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away. Hey, Dwight, I'm collecting resolution cards. Why not? Ugh. That's a good one. You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too. The bookstore? I'll come with you, show you how it's done. All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel. Hi. Why did we pretend like we work here? Good! Really? We kinda nailed it. Cool. A book about oceans. Whoa! Hold on. [Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh. I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that. I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties. Right on, son. And where did you go? So, that's it, guys? If you want, I can put on the strobe. I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office. Hey. [to Erin] How are the marks? I was thinking we could buy up of abandoned mine shafts.Phyllis, Stanley, Oooh! A lot of mines in Scranton. Uh, credit cards. My company would act as an intermedium, for like, point two cents off every transaction. Something with cell phones. It's like, every time you make a phone call I'd make point two cents. Or anything like any on-line shopping I would get point two cents. Great. What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team. It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some "Slumdog Millionaire" scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible. Well, I started my own golf supply company. It's taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth. Hmm? Some of these people are for real. Thank you. Excuse me. Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. [to Michael and Holly] Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on? Where's your jetpack, Zuckerberg? It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along. I can't wait. Which way did he go? She's right. He went that way. [on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hey Dwight. No, he hasn't. No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought... No. Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out... Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up] Okay. You've just lost my business. Hey, you were in there forever. She wandered off like an idiot. Hey. You know what? Say hi to Orville Tootenbacher for me. farts popcorn. Well, I think I can get through the door. What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying? I think he was heading downtown. I have no idea. I don't know. Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all. Okay. We fan out... Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below. Good. We don't need her. [on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles] [goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait. I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it. Thank you. All right. Dwight! Just leave it how you said... Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes? Pro. Make that face he likes. It's like a time b*mb... ...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging. Sexual time b*mb. [into recorder] Boner b*mb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera. No. [into recorder] Saving the world has never been this hard. No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending. Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces. Do the monkey face. I love that. I love that face. No. The monkey! Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop. That's good. That's good. He's throwing it. We took a walk. [Dwight Schrute dressed as a butler. Speaks in slow, deep voice] Master Scarn. Tell him I'm retired. Oh-[starts to freak out, but the scene is crudely cut short] Oh yeah! [laughs] Yes he is! You're eating eight year old tomatoes? I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh] Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging. Three months. Four months. Eight months? [Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months. One year. [time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months? Is Packer here? You did! You got b*rned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out. Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute. And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die. Thanks man, it'd mean a lot. well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk. Check it out! [grunting while humping Michael and Dwight] Don't even watch, Halpert! Oh, that's our Zen garden. [Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight. [continues working] Why? That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious] So, this hot chocolate thing. Well, you know you can't actually poison him. I really think we should join forces on this one. What do we think, what would drive him crazy. Here we go. You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them. Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number. He... It's a crime fighting beaver. Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred. [walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe] Yeah I couldn't cut it down. One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five? It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you! [trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you! Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I'm a huge boob nerd. He's a jerk. Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida? You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did. Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves. It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front. The signs will drive people inside. Close it. Close it. Close it. [starts wrestling Dwight] Just close it. Sure. Not so fast. Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here. Forget you. Fine, just give it. Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body. Screw you man. People like my stuff. You can take my Helen Fielding collection. Sure. How did those get out? I'm sorry. I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known. Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone. Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes. My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted. No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good. Thank you. Whatcha got there? Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco. things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have. [pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out. [to Dwight] Nice. Oh my God. It is right. I mean, it's impossible. They're probably worthless. Leave the telescope. Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, it's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else, I'm just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a- Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies. Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him. You know me very well, Dwight. Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day. I guess this is my life now. First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here. Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening. What recommendation? Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight. Anything can happen at the Dundies! [DeAngelo laughs] They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time! Black tie optional. So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. [Dwight looks suspecting] And that person is [he and DeAngelo roll their tongues as a drum roll] DeAngelo! [all applaud] Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods] [walks in] Hi! The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content. [jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo! [annoyed] Why? I can just run over to the gas station. [in the car] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well. Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a b*tch Award. What is your problem?! Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful. [sitting on the roof of the office building] Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude. Yes? Ahh, thank you. Like a butler. [Michael takes one and bites] Oh, these do not taste like oysters. Sick freak! What is wrong with you? I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? [Dwight scoffs] The job was not mine to give. [sighs] Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies. Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket... ...in order to feed the bears. How do you mean? Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni? [to Dwight] Do you believe that?! Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket] So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It's a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away] of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. [to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? [pulling out a small card from the envelope. Reads it] Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. [checks his watch quickly] Ohhh, yeah. You should see the other guy. [all are in the conference room for Michael's party. Michael isn't there. Jim gives the camera a knowing look] Well if he's not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. [Kevin nods] I for one love the corners. [cuts a corner piece, picks it up with his bare hands, and takes a bite] Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. [throws the piece in the garbage] No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. [grabs a piece from another corner. The office groans] What am I doing? [chucks it into the trashcan] Come on DeAngelo! [DeAngelo tries to lick the cake, everybody yells no] [holding two cups of coffee] There he is! Got ya coffee. [offers cup to Dwight] Not a coffee guy, I take it. Listen. I've got a sixer. "a*t*matic for the People" on the jukebox. Let's h*t the park after sundown. Come on! Pick up some sausage if you want. You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name. So I've never had to buy it. True story. I just drink my cousin's. You know what... straight up, why don't you like me? Ohhhh no. Okay? I'm gonna win you over. Yes I am. Oh yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Dwight, what's your take? Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates] Nope. Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office] Dwight? Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with. Do you need anything? Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. [laughter] Let's go downstairs! Okay? Let's do it. Damn it, Dwight! Enough! Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper! [Dwight immediately gets up and walks out] We could get Deangelo flowers. All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands] [on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy. Amen. Ooh, about what? I thought I needed to know for your calendar. Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in? You define foment. [clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system. Oh my God, what is wrong with you? It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal. No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying. Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know. Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture] Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site] Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic. And the desk. Okay. I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so... You can't f*re me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no f*ring powers. You wouldn't dare. [quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then. If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "Well that's pretty premature to think," but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared. I'm good. Why are you telling me this? Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster. Dwight, are you carrying a g*n? Dwight, g*n make me really uncomfortable. Why do you need to wear the holster at all? You could put your cell phone in it instead. You could put a banana in it. Dwight, no g*n, okay? Don't make us call Jo. Dwight went on a sh**ting spree, and then he sh*t Andy in the head. I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane. I'm gonna keep trying Jo. Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now! We all saw you do it. Navy blue. Little red anchors. I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands] I felt terrorized. Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that. Dwight, why is it on us to protect you? Hey. [Erin gasps] We're back. Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal. Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition. Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo? [singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a sh**ting spree? Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit. You have to get rid of all your w*apon. All of them. Including k*ller fish. Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good. Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in "Shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands? [quickly shakes his hands back and forth] Fine. Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers. Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. [Jim coughs] And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary. Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage. My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it. Hey, Jo! No, under the jacket. I don't feel anything. Push harder, Dwight. Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally] Knead it. Knead it like a pizza. Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel? What?! sh**ting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you sh*t a g*n? What is wrong with you? Beaumont-Adams is a girl's g*n. That just makes it plain stupid. Who else would be responsible? You sh*t a g*n off - Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius. I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job. Hey, Dwight. What's up? [to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that? Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks? [in elevator] Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that I'm gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that I'm never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and... I'm gonna die here. I just did. It's done. You don't know me! Anything about me! Get out of my head!] I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street. [nods at Dwight mockingly] [standing up] Get out. I don't have any, assh***. [comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview. Good! Yeah. Peepa. Great. No. You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again. [pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid. Yikes. Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile] Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you? Okay. Thank you. [softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes] Or what? You gonna sh**t me? I'll interview you right now. Question 1. Ever sh*t a g*n in the office? [seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. "Soo-ven-yay." Mr. "Jacques Soo-ven-yay." Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager. Assistant to the Regional Manager. What is it? I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question. [Gabe gets up to leave] If he isn't here in sixty seconds... [looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off] Let's just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what? All that for this job. [as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office. All right. Name. Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know. I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know. [ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss. Yes. Thank you, Dwight. No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen. Okay. Take care, man. [geeky voice] I want the job. I really do. It's just, the rest of my family's in the Finger Lakes right now. I'm supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now. I told them I was on a hike; snuck away to do this interview. I gotta get back pretty soon; they'll worry. People disappear in the Finger Lakes. [exiting elevator] After you my good sir. I can't get down. K... Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight's desk] Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I've got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I've added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I'm doin' great. I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman. Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this? Say no more. Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women's soccer, no? It's, it's nothing. No. Okay. Um, I'll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone? Ahhh! [falls out of chair] Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Thanks guys. Left. Okay, it's not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make. ‘Scuse me? [separately] No. Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl, Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar. That's regular pizza. I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you. Well, what about the other guys. No. I don't- I don't wanna say- No, no. Ha, I guess I think they're losers. Yeah? Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word "no" not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I'm being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with. Good night Andy. When me President, they see. [Nodding and smiling] They see. Ooh, why is it shaped like that? It's huge. How much does it weigh? How much memory does it have without the booster? How many L to a K? Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight's meeting. Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause...... I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax. Ok, I'm sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog...had to pull rank. [to group] OK, let's look at some ties. Here's how I'm going to help out from now on. I'm going to not care, and I'm going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy's inevitable demise. Dwight, anything? D-Bone. There you are. No, that's ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about... I know, right? Yeah...um, how is everything? Must be a tough time to be a family farm. Oof. What are you gonna do about that? There's gotta be some way you can double your beet sales... Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case...let's get to work. Invest in softer cotton, sir. [tattooing begins] OW! Oh! Oooh! [Crowd cheers] oh, whoa!! Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I'm gonna like it. Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog. Dwight! At least aim it. Come on buddy, get back. Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay. Yeah, that's pretty good. Nice job. Awesome. I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money. Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you... OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad. Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.] Alright. There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids. Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people. I'd go with that. Yeah we move stuff and it was fun. Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs] So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to. Kevin Costner. So, it's not the dumbest idea. But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes. So sadly, it's the best idea on the table. Is he OK? Why is the truck empty? Is that grease on my floor? And we did. Porque es muy rapido. Let me see it. Let me see it! Okay, don't be gross. Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way. Yeah, Dwight. No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO! Just give us the address. We'll look it up online. See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time. [pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw] Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea? There's so much more to it than that. It's a little tricky, you might have to... take... [Mose speeds away] Chapter 2 – Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present. Wow. [mouthful of food] I understand. Chapter 4 – One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon. I think we should toast... That's because you didn't bring a jacket. Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here. Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me? We'll talk. [walks away] I think I left my wallet in your house. Right here. Keys, keys... I didn't forget them, they're right here. I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing... Whoo. Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office? [Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you? What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman? Whoopi Goldberg. Very low pressure in the Sargasso Sea, warm air from South America, cold air from Greenland. All signs point to the perfect storm. What are you, anyway? If you had some really big wings with blades on the end, you'd kind of look like Kerrigan from Starcraft. If you're going to be a Zerg, at least be a Lurker, not some girl. Yeah, she also has boobs. Mmhmm. Dwight are you eating a stick? Everyone hates you. What do you like? Tornadoes? Oh yeah? What's the vaccine you can take to avoid a hurricane? [to Dwight] Are you serious? That's funny. Ok. Thank you. Dwight? Dwight. Dwight! Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes... [to dwight] Did you need something from us? Wha...Yes. Your attention. Uh because... No that is all. [walks out] Yeaha...yup. [awkward silence then points to door] Just trying to get in. What do you got? Sounds controversial. Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop. Go do the voodoo that you do so well. And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call...Dwight... If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper. What emails are you talking about? That's not that bad actually. Wait, so you installed a doomsday device? Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device. We can't do this Dwight. [Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smile...nod. Smile and nod. Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes. There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment. Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I... Alright everybody, you are doing great! Dwight, question. If this doomsday device goes off... If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that? Ok. Nope. Dwight we got five strikes. Did the email go out or... Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it. Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password. What?! We did our best. You're a real crumb bum, you know that? Uh, the man tree puts its penis- Nn no. Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down! I'll try both. Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you- What are you doing? Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in] [to Dwight] Where you going? Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water. Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is. Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right? No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha. You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk. I'm thinking cow- Hahhh, thanks for everything. Oh! [everyone yelling out, celebrating] We still have our jobs. This isn't one of those times. It's the police. They said it's the worst they've ever seen. Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this. You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It's a pregnant Helen Mirren.[everyone agrees] In this case yes. No we're not. Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves] Yes, because she's hot, right? Dwight, am I hot right now? What about before? Was I attractive before? Hmm. I think Jim's lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy. Five bucks if you can get him to admit it. Yep, that's the Dwight I need. Okay. I think so. Okay. Well, what does that... is that... okay. Yep, good. Honesty is very important to me. Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam. Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person. Jim's on to me. Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it. Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy. No, Kelly, don't. With the crotch? [music plays] Whoo! Who said that? How'd I get this long triangle? Is he puffing out his chest? No. Maybe he just said something funny. I think he's just making her laugh. Why's he making her laugh so much? Are you okay? Dwight! Dwight! [to Cathy] Sorry about that. Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why? Leave. Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now. Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do. I think the music left without you. Stop shoving me. Uh, are you all in line? Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him? You have to share the machine with others. Thank you. No, no, no. I have a new heart, you know. No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time. No. Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test? Wait, what? Jim, you have high blood pressure. I don't know. Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul. Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor. Just go home. It doesn't matter. That sounds super inspiring! I'm in! Actually it is the northernmost. Ha! I'm in too. [to Dwight] Yeah, but I'm confused... Mm-hmm. Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths. Dwight, what are you telling this girl? Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said. Interesting. Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal? he's a historian. Yes, yes, yes! Yes! Argh! What? Erin- Oh, well, that's a great question. Actually some of the most- Sure. Uh, I haven't heard of that one. Alright fine. You know what – I guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would. I'm still going. And I'm not going to ask anymore. I'm not even going to look back. I'm just going to assume that you're with me. Dwight – this is one of the archivists here. I thought maybe we could consult him. Yeah. You've heard about it? Dearest mother I'm sorry it has been so long since my last letter. It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms and I fear I may never leave this place alive. Melvin Fifer Garris. Wow. This is so much better than the story you made up. [knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning. Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR. No. No. No. You're way off on that one. Hey guys let's just all admit it. Ok? Dwight's better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he's never, ever going to go back on it right? Hey man. Taking a load off huh? Good luck with that. Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again] [sees a pole poking out Dwight's pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet] Prank! [throws money from Dwight's wallet on the floor] You know what it's not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right? Because you're sitting? Ok. Because you're sitting? You know I have to do this. Alright. You don't have to say it if you're doing it. Uh weight lifting yeah. I'll take a look. I've been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn't realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents. Well it's sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection. Well it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult. I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that. You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute. Dwight why don't you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals. Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they've ever been to me. What I wouldn't give for one of Phyllis' classic room clearing farts right now. Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5. Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I'm not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym. We promised we'd never say goodbye. Enough Oscar, enough. I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet. Got it. Getting my sweat on. I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill. No. Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow. It's Lejon Brames. You know, get it right. Oh boy. Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say. Okay, I'm not doing that. Hmm? This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy. Dwight, come back and spot me. To push this bar up. Help me! To look good for Val! Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required. That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon. Light side. As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront. Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words "HARD ASS"] But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps. Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he. What was that? Can't do that. So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me. [serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding! Oh my god. I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine? No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife. Nice try, this is ridiculous. Three times. OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control... [on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up. [on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled? And what's it's name? I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.[Christmas Time is Here by Vince Guaraldi Trio is playing in the background] Ah! My Santa suit's stuck. Whoo. Dwight. Aw! It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person! Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage. Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine. Oh, hello Mr. Schrute. I'll tell him you're here. Can I get you anything at all? Dwight? What are you doing here? Course I know. Dwight. You made it. Impressive initiative. I don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination. [Gabe laughs] Well, uh, let me settle in and I'll be with you shortly. [on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up] What's the most important appliance in your house? [makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential. Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO. CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes. Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a f*re, so your appointment got- Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf. Chill, man. This plan is airtight. Well, you got my vote. I know. What? You're doing great. You know, so good. Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! [Gabe makes a flushing motion, Dwight twists Gabe's arm] Ow! Ow! He went home. Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing. Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help! So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no. I don't know. All I know is the building. They haven't really improved on the Oreo, have they? Sit down, Dwight. You were dining alone? All those people are you? It's wet, it's filled with mold, strange insects, alligators. Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight. You know that, right? [holds a medal to the light] This medal was my grandfather's. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It's a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better? [holds out medal] Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I'll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place.  It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird. You've been meatballed! [laughs] Are you ready for some meatball? Look for your stapler! [to Phyllis] Oh okay. Good night. [climbs in to Dwight's car] What's the haul? Good day. Oh, who needs a house that size? Hey, Dwight Snoot. What you doing? Come on, don't you want to play? Yeah. [Dwight dunks her] Oh! Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous. [giggles] Stop. No, you stop. [to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop. No, no, no, he's not looking. I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't b*rned off yet. Awkward stage. Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end. What is the most romantic possible thing? Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all. Dang it! What the heck already? I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath. [knocks Cathy off Kevin's shoulders] Yes! Woo! Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together. Yeah! Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what. Mush, mush, mush! Come on! [muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it- Sure. Sure we did. Shut it, Angela. Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday. Mmm. Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me. We're done. Erin and I are over. Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out. It was pretty uneventful, actually. Nope. Not guilty. We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come. Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas. He's more than substantial. He's a monster. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, wait, wait. No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you. What's up, gangstas? Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory. No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill. Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch. Attaboy. Good. Now, chill. Yeah, sure, of course. I'd f*re him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously] [pulls food truck up to where Dwight and Nate are standing] Where you want I park? Uh, I'm going to say "I" when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of "he says blah, blah, blah," I'm going to say "I say, blah, blah, blah," but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, "He remembers Toby." [makes face] "I remember Toby." The empanada guy! He says, "No." Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients. Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink. Why? Everybody's heard it. His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse. Funny? No? Nobody laughing? Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good. Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die. Dwight, cut it out. I'm not f*ring Jim. I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap] [on voicemail] You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao. [beep] Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP. Dwight. Hey. He went to the car or something, but he'll be back. Don't you want to see the baby? I promised I wouldn't tell. Angela got pregnant before the wedding. She got pregnant before the wedding. A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me! Dwight. Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it. Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves. Mama! Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby. That is completely untrue. Completely true. Remember? Angela. No. I did not. Uh-uh. That didn't happen. No! Stop it! Dwight. And even if it did, it's just a coincidence. I will not. All done? Yes, yes. He's sleeping. Sure. [gives Philip to Dwight] Watch the head, watch the head. Who are you? Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here. You had something important to tell me? Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant. Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi! Dwight, I have exciting news for you. I think you're going to like it. Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that... That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk. No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah! Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a "we're just friends" beanie or a "I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'" beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie. Really? Ooh, me three. Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about? [reading card] "I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day." Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves. Kathy. You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar? Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps? They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find. Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin. You have your team. Back off! I got my reasons. Why? What?! It just feels like a slap in the face. We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are. Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape. What are the criteria for going? Mooshie mooshie. [Dwight laughs] My baby is not a monster! Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me. OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out. Five to six hours? No no no no. Nope. I am... Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that. Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something... It has been a long, lonely winter. Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team. I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head. Exactly. Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go. You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go. Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone] Essential. Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks. Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates. Kathy.. ....Stanley.. ...Ryan... ...Erin... ...And, Jim. You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! Why is it so hot in here? But... No no, I want to go. Is that the buzzer from Taboo? SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it. How did a mosquito get in here? I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits] Mosquito. Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie. I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back. So, what is this special project? That sounds awesome. Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. [Dwight writes on whiteboard] Oh, don't write it down unless you like it. How do we make this a better party? Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us? [long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?  Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late. Wake up! [Cathy screams] Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep. Mmm! [struggles] Ugh! I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides] What do you think happened? Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before. Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. g*n goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan. I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her. What does he like? Okay, and this one is, "Huh. Don't see too many museums around here." Hey, are you okay? Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you. Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, "For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?" and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something? Still q*eer? Let me just get the projector working. You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote. Okay. Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. [points to Ryan] You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon. I can do it. Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go. Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding. Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance? Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense. Did you say "masturbator?" Why are you sitting down like that? I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt. Dude, I think you have appendicitis. Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while? Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen. No one's moving! Oh, oh! [general commotion] Two or three days. Drama queen, am I right? I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] Oh, there's the phone! Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later. Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess. Very good point. Dwight, are you all right? I'm great. How are you? Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours. Do a hundred jumping jacks. [doing jumping jacks] Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine- You haven't done any of the research. Yup. Ah, what is your topic? Retail consumer habits. Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay. I can field this one. Are those the lyrics? [whispers] Convenience. Service. Building loyalty. Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight. You are bleeding through your shirt. How are you feeling? Can I see the wound? Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed. A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet. Oh, yikes. Incoming- [tries to touch the wound] It would be an honor, ma'am. I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now. That's great. Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP. I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more. Catching butterflies. Theater. Dragging. Dragging sticks. Not good enough (clicks tongue) Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him. Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips. What happens if you're the hunchback? How many buttons do you have? Can I see? So, I get to kick you now. College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight) I will be here. Oh, please, You're through. She's going to give it to me as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle. [clicks tongue, whinnies] What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me. Like I'm on the beach.[Packer blows in Nellie's ear] Impressive. You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit. [on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt. Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis. What's in it for GSL? Got it. If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses. I haven't seen anything. Jeez... Brown, shiny, painful bite. Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation. So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this. Yeah. I know. Ow. Just check it. Alright. He knows what he's doing. Alright, then I will catch you later... What do we do now? I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again. Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here. Come on. You know what? Maybe they just ate. Okay, they're fine. They're adults. Is that really how you want to get this job? They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore! Put your forehead near mine, and see if you can read my thoughts. No, no, no, not numbers, no. No. Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time. Mm-hmm. mm-hmm... I will see you in seven- Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]... Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie] Cathy, go. Awesome. Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?! I can't breathe! Nice job, I think you got 'em. [Jim face] [whispers] Is that Nellie?  Are you holding this chair? ‘cause I feel like I'm gonna fall off. I'm not wearing the right shoes for this. Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I'm this patrician goddess. But here's the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ... what's lower than dirt? Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey. When people see this presentation, they're gonna [bleep] in their pants. Seriously disgusting. Ugh. k*ll me. That was my idea. I don't see what that gets us, but I'm a team player. I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples. I didn't do anything any of you wouldn't have done. Quit it. I was ahead of you! Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad. Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really -- on the Internet, it's a really -- that's a really good, good, thing. I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck? You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck!  Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do. Point it towards the store, idiot! [laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over. [softly] Take that, kid. Patty Grossman. I'm a woman. Yes. Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it? You know what? Dwight. God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say. You're so ignorant. You barely know what you're talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books. Oh! "Fix" means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink! No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red! Oh... [Kelly laughing] I'm on break. When's the presentation? Well... About ten minutes. Oops, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out? What is the delay here? Where's Ryan? Why is he not here? What? That's.... I'm not doing the Presentation. Okay, I'll do it. A costume? Of course there's a costume! [laughs]  Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation. I've been in here for 20 seconds. I'm not wearing eyeliner. Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that's -- This... is the future, because... This is the past. I've been through a lot of issues in my life. I've seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I've been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause] Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain K*llers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off.  I just feel good! Dwight.  You're the vice president. [squealing] aagh! Aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling] [feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow! Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo. I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either. Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift] He doesn't even care. [to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it. [attempts to shake Dwight's hand] Goodbye, Dwight. I couldn't just k*ll the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight. [to Dwight] Bravo, Dwight! Very good! [Jim looks surprised] [to Jim] Shame. I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen. When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to Nellie] You'd spin off right. I'd spin off- [enters room] All right. There he is. Can I just talk to you for one quick second? Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway] Nice. [To Jim] Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy? Aw, I'm just trying to- That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made. You know, I just think you should know that- Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again] [enters abruptly] Dwight. OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please? Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store. Dwight, he's gonna k*ll the store. And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna f*re you for it. Yes. Dwight, please. OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so- Dwight, come o- Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight] Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva? Gross! What? What, what, what, what, what? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I forgot. You all right? You ok? We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly] What are you doing? Get up. Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by. OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work. [tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no. This is dangerous. Why? Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away] I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, "Look, a balloon." And I was still just a paper salesman. Yeah. Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here. What? Dwight, should she be our manager? I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm. Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight. Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise. Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise? Then you accept it? Absolutely not. Seven percent. The raise isn't real. I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that. No. No. No. No. No. Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off. [Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow. Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache] Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands] He does have a moustache. What does that mean? Let's help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place. What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh] Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door. That was one time- Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight. Andy! Hey! Yes, you should. [reads] "Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie." I doubt that they're sh- Whoa. Who is this guy? Boyfriend. Like a boyfriend? Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out. I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry. God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant. I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories. [yells] What the hell? All right, where's Phyllis? Who's Phyllis? Look. This is really uncool, okay? I put on a clean show here- What? What happened to old salty? Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato. When you lost the manager job- Did it affect you outside of the office? I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis? Oh, okay. Okay. Oh. I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming. One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that. Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on. What do you mean? This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem. Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie? Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times. I know, right? Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles. That's... That's not the point! My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district! What's going on? How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there? No! It was my idea to not be r*ped! Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody. [on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you! The winner of the three day trip to the sky top lodge is Dwight Schrute! The yearlong membership to Scraton-Bikram Yoga is Dwight Schrute! A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to Dwight Schrute! Well, I think I can save us some time, Dwight Schrute has won every single item here! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat. I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They'd flex them all night at the discotheque. Yeah. All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go. Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows. We got it? All right, easy there, grandpa. Okay. You don't need my help? All right, well, enjoy the alumni game. Thanks Janet. Wow, simultaneous sale. Hey, hey, come on, language. In the fridge. Jim, Dwight, what are your last names? The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it. Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money. Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch] There's actually not a rule that says that. No. Robert's here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to h*t each other with. I don't think we were doing that. Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There's no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems... so poorly timed. Listen, Robert, I don't have time. There's a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions – Used to be Binghamton's – I want it, it's mine. We need you to make a decision. Is it just me or is our boss a freakin' weirdo? [stands up, walks outside] I'm gonna get some air. [Gets up and looks out Nellie's office window] He's running! Damn it. It's a monkey. Hold on, hold on. Is this him? Is that him? What? What am I gonna do? I don't – Dwight! Nos? You mean like in fast and furious? Oh, yeah, definitely have nos. Are you sure? Brace yourself. 3... 2... Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe... you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember. Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together] You all right? [Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing? What are you talking about? I don't even know where the stairs are! [Dwight jumping] What are you doing? What? My pants fell down! I don't have a belt! What's going on? Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse – Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay. Let me stop you all right here. I've already picked a new paper supplier. Give me a cup of coffee. All right, guys. It didn't work out for any of us, so... we're still on the same team. Let me get these. You know, your partner's got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating? But you're saying there's a chance. Oh, man, I'd have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions. Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine. What's he doing? No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead. Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God! Fine. One, two, three! I don't want to! ...their own children. No thank you. Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest. Wait, C-R-A-Z... Great. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, so that's it? See? That wasn't so hard. Thanks. Dwight. [Phillip cries] See the duckie! [slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is. Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate. I guess we're okay with the fingernails. I'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second. No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight! Do you see David Wallace in the room right now? It's been a great year. Where is it? How long does it take to get the results? You're gonna wait here? Andy's coming back today! Andy's coming back today! Ha! Andy's coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time. No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane. Whoa! Mind blown. It's like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr? Dwight, Jr! [Dwight gives Clark a noogie] Now I know why Michael hated you so much. I think I'm busy that night. Or I would. Learning what? Kay. Is this—is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that's totally fine. Like, I'm fine with it. But you should know that I'm into the ladies. You know, if you're ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you. So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven't had time to pursue yet? Yeah, I'll just give it a glance— I'll give it a read. Yeah. I am. Ok. You're not getting my clients! Nice try. Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job. Done. Explain. Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday. The new guys called one. Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black? Hey, yes. Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail? Well it's official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool. This is a bloodbath. Alright, I'm calling this. It is enough of this. Everyone, let's go back to work. This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots. Dwight! [sees trapeze contraption] What are you doing? Oh, come on, Pete! God, that's just sad. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim. I will? Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds. No. Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life. Exactly the way it is. Yes, and there's nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it. Find someone else, I don't know. Ask Phyllis. Kay. Ok. [prepares bike trapeze]Oh, god.[Jim tries dialing and hangs up] Hey, man. It's halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don't. I'm in. Yeah, yep, I'm all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah! Dwight, what about you? Dwight, you will be participating. Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like. Great, thank you. [everyone groans] Oh, for goodness' sake, Dwight. Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back. You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here. Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract] [takes contract] Absolutely, I will. [holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this? Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it. Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off. I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity. In that case, you... [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand. I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands. [whispering] Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard. Is it gonna be long? God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well. Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know. [Andy smiles at camera] 127 hours. It's about this guy who- My bad. Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy. That is absolutely revolting! He is so good, though. The way he just cuts off his arm. Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time. Well, it doesn't make you stupid. Stupid like you. Like you. You're the stupid one. You're the stupid one. Who am I? I'm Jim. We've been working together for twelve years. Ha, Weird joke, Dwight. You seriously never noticed? Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race. You have one new message. Dwight, cut it out, I'm trying to work. Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours. I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim![Dwight shows fake Jim of the Halpert family portrait but notices that Jim and the kids have been replaced with fake Jim and Asian kids] [speaking in French] S"il vous plait...dites-Moi...Ugggghhh les Bleagh! I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there! You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild. Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic w*r-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads. Yeah! Let's do it! [shocked] Oh! Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy. Foth aggendak! Foth aggendi! Foth aggenda! [in a barbaric growl] Forth aggenda! Addor! Qazer! Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language. Dwight's grandfather was a—[is interrupted by Dwight]. I was gonna say he was a tax evader. Yeah, that—you're being really mean, Andy. A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! [Points to video] Who's this guy?[Jim steps back and forth from plate on video as Andy sings Meow Mix theme]Look at him dance. Fail! [Group continues chanting "Fail!"]That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm. [Group keeps chanting] You're all failing right now. [Group continues] Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail! [Group claps and chants] What's going on? What's he measuring? Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven. OK, listen. Everything here is up to code. Sure. I'll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I'll sign that. You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts. Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests] I'm not gonna grow a third arm! headaches..." "..breast pain..." Oof. "Infertility." Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me? What? That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag...[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight's chair] Oh my god. Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement. Nice job. What? [Bus pulls into lot] Bring it in! Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking? Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam. Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever? No question. [To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh? Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work. OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop. No! Pies! Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing- What? Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank. No. Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant. That doesn't matter. Ok...that's not... Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children? Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin.. Whoa! Whoa! Dwight! [group reacts] You feel OK now? Don't..  [screaming upon seeing pumpkin-headed Dwight] [screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision I've ever made. It won't budge. I can't get it out. Try again! I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin... [as Jim approaches with a Kn*fe] Jim, no. No. No! No! But as Jim and I discovered... No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me. Aaah! [everyone clapping] So good! Okay. Shut up. [laughs] [laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it stop it stop it stop it! [picking up spilled candy] Hello little pill. What do you do? [laughing] Gross. I love it. Something wrong Dwight? Yes? The mind is part of the body. Dwight, our co-workers' health issues are really none of our business so- Yeah, you're right. This man needs to be apprehended. All right. [laughs] Awesome. Cool. You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning. I can't really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks. Get under your chin first. Yeah. Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah. Yeah, that's crazy. Hey. [laughing] It's funny right? [Toby starts to lean in for a kiss, then runs away] Okay, look Dwight, let's just call this thing off. I mean, it's just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety. Cool. Free upper. Don't dog catch me! The pill is mine. Get her out. Show some pride. This is crap. Oh. Oh, well good for you. I mean, you'll need a prescription. Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he's a good man and that I hope he feels better. The real Mose. Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues? [Dwight raises hand] I do! I do. I do. I do. I do. We're done Meredith. Dwight! No, you chose yourself. Awesome. Have fun. [Darryl plays radio show music on keyboard] And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute. Let's do it! [As Iris] So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command? Uh, excuse me. [reading card held up by Jim] I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons? [Jim mimes taking shirt off] I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together. Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. [Jim holds up card that says "Now Pants"] Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine. Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble. I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic? Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do. No the paper's not toxic. Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic! What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?! Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to? Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron? Are you insulting my guests? Oh that is nice. Classy move. [leaves] The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%. Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time? [using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm] Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record! [On phone] Hello? Dwight? Yeah? Are you ok? Well, thanks Dwight. Dwight? What? Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go. Shrute! Shrute! Shrute!Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! [joins in] Shrute! Shrute! Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh. [on speakerphone] Well, I have some very exciting news. Jim, good! You should hear this too. [taking away Dwight's handset] Go ahead David, I'm listening. Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They've apparently just dropped the supplier they've been with for the last ten years. . The White Pages. Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you. He's in the bathroom. Of course. [from the kitchen] Eat it Stanley! No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It's someone new but she didn't catch her name. No, hey, Dwight shouldn't... Good luck! Dwight, you can't go. You have a problem with women. You can't sell to them. Yeah, she said she corrected him five times. So, uh, show us how you'd normally sell to a female client. Okay, you just walked into her office and begin. Hello. I am? Hmm.. [deep voice] Hi, I'm Mr. Hannon. How can I help you? Oh, I'll be the buyer. Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat. No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs. Okay, let's stop here. Anyone have any thoughts? Okay, when you're selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now? Okay, well you have to show us. Huh. [nodding] Uh huh. A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it? It's just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person. And then we thought we'd ... I can't. I just can't carry on with that face. Look at it. I'm gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he's laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh. Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It's all garbage okay? You're the woman, I'm the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn. Ms. Thomas, so good to see you. Oh, are those your kids? They're so cute! They could be models. You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women. Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience? Okay, so, when you're selling to this woman, just imagine that she's that nice, reasonable barber. Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps. Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs? Okay, great. Oh my God. It's Jan. I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct? I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace after all these years. Oh, well. What are you doing? Stop. Stop that. You did good, Dwight. It's okay. I mean, seriously, Jan's not normal. Let's just go. She's not going to sell to us. No. Where's the Quizno's? I -- I -- Do what? Get into sales? That's what I want. Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business. Thanks. Okay. Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number. That's a license number? Oh. Why me? She doesn't know. I shouldn't be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a h*m*. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love. [upon seeing Dwight naked] Ugh! Dwight, it's not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on. Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh. My marriage is in danger. I don't know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me. Something like that. Can you arrange a meeting? Okay. Okay. Okay. Ow! Dwight! Ow! Is it safe to talk? Do you have a g*n? Read the receipt. That's a $300 g*n. Someone could steal it. Now I keep it in a safe. Oh, you tell me. [shows Dwight receipt] All right. Okay, that's the big one. That's the big "M." What if they deserved it? They're sleeping with my husband. This seems a little crazy. But I think I'm up for it. Thank you. What about a knee-capping? Yes, a knee-capping could work. You said you would be there for me. It's the only thing that will make this right. What? Why did you call me out here? I don't know what you're talking about. Fine! It's Oscar. So what? Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband. Well, you might be right. But it's too late now. He's here. No! No, no! [groans] What? What are you doing? Got it. Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, don't lie. I'm trying to save those precious knees you're always bragging about.  Now, let's get out of here. He could be right behind us. Let's get it on. I'm gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but I'm gonna do this. I got it. You don't-- [all three grunting] Okay, okay, okay, okay. See ya later, Heymont. What the hell, Dwight? you are incorrigible! I'm so sorry. Angela-- I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day. [crying] Jazz is stupid!  I mean, just play the right notes! I don't like your friend Trevor. Shut up, Hide!  I mean, do you think Kevin cares what people think about him-- or Creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I'm okay with that. Is it called red-vining? I don't... People red vine. They don't have vaginas. No. They're just regular men. 00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking. So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word "Philadelphia"? Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people? Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand? Too weird. [Clears her throat] The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas. Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously. And that is... That there are no rules. Thank you. Ugh. What is this stuff, lava? What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don't touch it. Oh! Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat. Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine? How would anyone even know-- So happy right now.[Jim and Pam get up and run out into The Office] It's the lining of the stomach of-- Yes, he is finally nigh. I am nigh! Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel. So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse. And the fear. Come on, Dwight, you're making this up. Wow. Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No. [Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful. Thank you, Dwight. These are nice. Oh, it's like naughty or nice. Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list? Oh, nice. Did you check that list? But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake. Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's-- Damn. [Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these? I'd rather have the bowl. Ow! You h*t people with that thing? [Holds the mouse trap up] Mouse trap.[While Dwight is decided on others, he puts canning jars in Angela's bowl, and a twig in Stanley's, then a normal talking head] Oh, you know what? I gotta go. Yeah, it's all right. I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay. Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep. Ooh. That's right. Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody. You know what? Yeah. Have at it. Ooh! Are you nuts? Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't h*t anybody that hard. [As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh! What's going on? For what it's worth, I liked your party better. I don't think anyone thought that. Well, that didn't have anything to do with you. Zero. Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog? What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building. No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss] 00 a.m.[All cheering and chanting as Jim and Dwight try and break the pig rib] [Falls backwards onto the food table] Oh! Whoa![Everyone shouts alarmidly] Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower? Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly. Just lice Pam? Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7. Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear. What are you wearing? No. I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this. No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats... What do we do about our heads? Okay. [handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away. Put those away before you hurt yourself. Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall. Is there a volume knob on that thing? Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam. Dwight, are you okay!? I'm back together with Val. Yay... Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They're a family owned business [chuckles]. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We'd go in pretending to be family – brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store. Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew. Sorry, Stinky, can't do it. Too busy. Okay. There's no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something. I have ears, Dwight. Hey, I'm in Philadelphia right now. Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour? Actually, it's pronounced "espresso"... Wait. That's what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So... If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission. [sarcastically chuckling] I loved it. If it'll lead to me being a salesman, I'll pretend to be your friend. [chuckling] It's kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store. No, we sure hadn't Pop. [both chuckling] He calls me Clarky ‘cause he's my Dad. My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he's like a serial k*ller... of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick! [Dwight imitates sawing and blood spurting out of his neck, then makes a dying noise] [back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home. [sighs] I can't relate to that, my son hates my guts. Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that? [enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but... God I missed you! [confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool. ...And I love you, for saying that. [catches on] Ha ha! I just b*rned him. Because the truth is... our relationship is... terr- Terrible. Well, I understand, but – Listen to him. He created you. Women don't despise me... Alright, that's enough, ‘cause I can say some things about him too. Like the time that you got drunk and, and then... k*lled those kids on their way to prom! So we can offer you matte or glossy printing- There's obviously a volume discount uh, if you- Here he is, my son. I'm sorry, you guys are here to sell us paper? Sons used to idolize their fathers. Okay Pop... [to Clark in dressing room] That's Italian silk. Very comfortable. Very tasteful... Although expensive. Well, that's better than looking like the undertaker from boring island. [emerges from dressing room wearing a sharp black suit] How do I look? What's going on? You opened the door- Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right? Why?  I don't get it. A lightbul-- Whoa. I don't. Annex. It must open something in the annex. Whoa. "Sedes introiti." Seat of entrance. Oh, I expected more from young Halpert. Cece's ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I've been working with her on her move. It's called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It's kind of like this. It's pretty cute, right? Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That's why I'm doing it. Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I'm switching over. Yep. Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity. Yeah. Even you. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man.  "Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously." I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie. [murmuring] Wait. This says "Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge"? Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I'm getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows. Yeah, we'll see about that. They got us set up with Windows 95,  so you're kind of dreaming here. Okay, I'm gonna need you to print it out.[dot matrix printer beeping and whirring loudly] Ooh, it's when you get a free sandwich after you've already eaten ten sandwiches. Thank you. Thank you. Loyalty. Loyalty is exactly right. I'm sorry. Do I still need to be here? I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let's-- let's use an example. Take Erin. Erin's boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean. Shh! Kids are dancing. Dwight, look, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that. It can. All right, let's get this over with. You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah! How far is this place? [turns off radio] I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no. They have fast food in Philly. And your milkshake. It's 30 degrees out. You drinkin' a mildshake? Nope. [throwing milkshake] f*re in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that's what working at a paper company's all about![Darryl take keys out of ignition] You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage. Hello, Peter. f*re in the hole! [throwing milkshake] Go! Go! Go! Go! [tires screech] Lady...you never stop surprising me. [clears throat] Hey, so I hear you're bringing in some people to interview for the sales job? Well, uh... see, you raised it. Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did. You know what, man? I deserve this job. I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond... and under. You know what? You're gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you're going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance. This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome. You could've just called that an alliance too, right? There he is. Nice. Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix – me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So... problem solved. Thanks, guys. I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone. I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don't do earbuds. [sighs] It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter. Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you're qualified to evaluate me? What are your credentials? I think I've heard everything I need to hear. Thank you, Dwight. I'll be in touch. Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, "Jump," and he says, "Oh who?" He loves to jump on people, that Trevor. Ooh, okay. Didn't see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it. Pass. Next one. No, no and no. Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking? I looked at you coming around, and I said, "Wintergreen." I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly. That's just a classic no-win situation. So I'd Kobayashi Maru it. Yep. You know what, Dwight? This interview's over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru'd the whole process. Yeah. Star Trek rules. Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that? [chuckles] Walked right into that one. Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise. People person. That's right. Yes. Okay. X-Men school? Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input— Hey, Dwight. It's David. Jim says he'd like some say in the hiring process. Okay. I can't say that that's not fair. Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later. Uh... [clears throat] Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call? Yes, okay. Bye. No, thanks. Dwight, you can't just hire someone ‘cause they're your friend. They're freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks. Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch. Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch. Wolf is hilarious. He has ex*cuted me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ‘em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof. Do you want this paper? It's not very good. I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad. Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It's over. I am. I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University. Thank you. [chuckles] Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no f*re in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He's a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I'm hesitant. Why can't I pull the trigger on any of them? Do you need to be changed? Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I've been double-parked for five hours. I'm wondering if I should move my car. Yeah, whether it's me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvina— Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you. I could start Monday. Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'. That's what I always say. Just act natural. [grunts] But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars. Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor? I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin. Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You? I'm sorry? Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say. Too much now. Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep. No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don't open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe. I got it. Paintball. [yelling] And what are we supposed to do until then? Take care of my wife. I will be back. I'm good. Oh, I'm sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee. Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy? Us. Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I'll distract him, you take that. [shushes]Pam & [laughs] No! No, Dwight! [entering office] Conference room. Everybody. Now! Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting. Yeah. [as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go. You will? I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car. [approaches Dwight as he leaves] Hey! Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you. What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people. Aw, crap. You're gonna to compare 'um to the butts up there. [gestures mural] All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws. OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go. We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could cr*ck him. See, I feel bad about that. So, she's gonna pull through again? [all nod] That's great. Can I talk to her? Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business. All right. You can go. Give him his gum. That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy. We should just take him down. I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face. Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt. Yes! Yes! We need an infiltrator. Clark? Oh, crap. Were those yours? Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys. What lines? Oh, great! [to Dwight] His truck! OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that? I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural? Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet. Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid. Yeah. And he has saggy boobs. Yeah. I feel better. I know. You miss Angela, don't you? Perfect. [Pete walks away eying the camera knowingly] [knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in. [talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract. [pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-d*ck-doo, rick-a-d*ck-d*ck-d*ck, rick-a-d*ck-doo. Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up. [to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign. [in his office doorway, bearded and unkept] Hi Dwight. Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin. Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. [removes wooden instruments from bag] Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. [removes güiro and begins playing and singing] Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. [sings while Kevin echoes] Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months? I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous. And you sold it to Jan too. I mean... I'm impressed. Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight. I was... That... OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'. Say it. Coolio. Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up. Hmm. Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing? Yeah. You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option. Well, ah, ah... Uh-huh... [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed. He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right? God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months. Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands. I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip. You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank... What?! There was a f*re in the warehouse? Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note. [on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do. Ahh! Dwight! What? What is it? Dwight, that's awful. What do you mean by "poisoned"? Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt. But I don't see how this is my problem. Ugh. Gah. It's fine. Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll- I'll help you! Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now? I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow. Who's this little kitchen witch? She's so tiny like a little kitchen witch. New clothes? What for? [Aunt Shirley's boob shows] Oh, God. Ow! I could do that. No. No. No. Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly. [coughs and laughs in her sleep] Spray her down? Time to get clean! You have to use chains? Let's get this show on the road. Dwight! No! No! Stop your belly-aching and hose me. No Dwight! No, Dwight! No Dwight, I won't- [hoses Dwight] [grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub? I feel like a show pony. You're welcome. Would you like some stew? Mmhm. Is it any good? Alright. So, tell me all about it. It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight. No, Dwight. The Senator. I can't be your monkey, Dwight. I made a vow. I gave my word.  Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are. Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close? I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother. My condolences. OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails? [while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god. I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session... [as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place. OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball. OK. [playing guitar and singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning'] Zeke's here. 'Hi' to Mom. Will there be ghosts there? You get in the sidecar. Get... You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face. [as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that? You have a brother? [gathers and tastes soil] Huh. It's crap soil. Nothing's going to grow here. Yeah, well, I'm just saying it's garbage soil, that's all. It's fine 'cause they're not going to grow. Would the family care to say something? [approaches and hugs Dwight] I see you started without me. Blugh. Dwight. Hi Dwight. This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn. We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here. Land size? [all shake heads] [removes hat] Shirley, at 1600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area. Sharing borders with six other farms. Including my own farm. And your nephew Dwight's. [replaces hat] OK. [drives away] Oh, right. Uh, you know, I don't think we have to do this. [on a recorded video] Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life's big sunset, I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. You've all disappointed me greatly. Fannie. A single mamma in the city. After I left the army, I bought a 9-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out "worm" means something else out there. And, I am now in the business of... pain management. Or, the smoking of pain management. Snap out of it. Dwight? No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. Are you crazy? Look. I, I don't want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain... sort of sophistication. Totally. Yep. The people here are like [makes farting sound, laughs] Like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart? Uh, somehow how I think a couple of nights could hurt. That doesn't work on me. By the way, that's not... Very funny. OK. Oui, oui, oui. Oh my goodness. [after following Dwight to the chicken coop, before sunrise] Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them? I was just asking you something I didn't know. [after grabbing an egg] Are we gonna eat these today? Is that a guillotine? [referencing goat] That's a cow? [after seeing Dwight smelling milk] What are you doing now? I don't know. I don't know any of that. Not it. Yeah. What? Well there you go. That's muy caliente. What the hell?! You can have this back at the end of the day. [cut to Andy listening to the iPod and looking aroused, water is dumped on him] Oh!! What's her name? Sweet. Oh yeah. Keep talkin'. Oh. The same thing that you think. Let's go to the conference room. I bet she does. I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth. Yes. Fine office you have here. Sturdy walls. Let's talk terms. If you agree to a forty sixty split on this tractor, I'll store it in one of my barns. Esther, get in the truck. 19, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!"[reading] "He's not hawt, he's gay." [typing] "Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again." [reading] "He is hawt!" See, thank you, that's more like it. "He is butt." God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh! Standard. Hey, can I talk to you for one second? One second. One second. Don't do it. [takes Dwight's pen] Dude, we're being conned. These chicks are way too hot to be into us. Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor. Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her. I don't even know what an auger is! Hey, you ready to sign? We're gonna get him. A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours. Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way. Dwight, we need to talk. Look, we're gonna have the tractor for the same amount of work days but my dad is planning on leasing it to the Vanderkirk brothers on the weekends. So you're going to be paying more, but he's putting on ten times the miles and he's pocketing a profit behind your back. You need to tell him you want a deal based on miles or he can just stick that tractor where the sun don't shine. Mmhm. Of course. [laughs] You didn't just think I was tractor bait, did you? Hey Dwight, what's an auger used for? I don't know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, "Red Alert." "In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There's Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get." [walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can't you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee? Son, you've lost your mind. I'm not going anywhere until you fix my elevator. All right, if I have to be the good wife, I'll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I'm a better wife than that. [sighs] Yeah, come on in. I'm just on hold with another talent agency. It's insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there's more. 251. 252. I can't even keep up! [grunts intensely] I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That's final. Yes! I'm sorry I'm being curt, it's just I'm about to land a top talent agent. [on the phone] Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory. Hey, Dwight. Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next? Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a thr*at to be credible, you ha— No, you didn't. Sick of you and your—ooh— [falls to the floor with a loud thud] Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren't those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him? You gave him three sh*ts. All right. Move it! One, two, three. [grunts] We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something. Yes. Any good weekend plans? Nice. Uh, I don't know yet. I was thinking about... And then what? Well, if I may, you're a natural. That's a little weird. I know. Evel Knievel. [connect helmet straps around Stanley's head] That's about as good as that's gonna be. Catch? I can't catch him. He's like, 250 pounds. Blunt? Dude, this size of my haunches— [Stanley's body slips down the stairs and his head thumps into a wall] We should probably call a doctor or something, dude. [gags] We can't just leave him bubble wrapped like this. That's actually really smart. God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge. Hey, wait, wait, how—how are we doing this? Just say "arms" and "legs," okay? That just—that's the vernacular that I'm comfortable with. [sighs] Wha—What's a shank? It's by the tenderloin. All right. Yeah—yup yup. What? Aw, come on. Damn it. Pigeons. Isn't the client, like, best friends with his sister? [whispers] That they do. Stanley, what is going on here? Driving. Ooh-hoo, look at that baby... Very special little boy. Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, he'll go, "eee." A beautiful family. [laughs] Right? Come on! So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it? Oh, no, I'm not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up. [stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground] [grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz. Who's pumped for the quarter finals, huh? I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer. Yes! Uh huh. Oh man. This is flatter. Nice. Tom Brokaw! Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther] No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck. Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals. Whoo! Hey. Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow. [to Dwight] Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman? Oh. Is she a gambler? I believe I want to go home. Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes. Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight. We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely. [Angela looks disgusted] I guess. Smasher! Smasher? No, where'd you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city's best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts. I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don't spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt. Fireball! I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts. It's not a large room, I think they heard me. That's really ok. I'm mostly focused on the belt here. Hold it—Take a step back. Take a step back. [they bow, then Dwight thrusts again] Okay, okay. I can't—I can't do this if you're gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we're gonna have to cut this off. Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying. Congratulations. Okay. Yes, I will. [Dwight starts doing karate] Yeah, I'm watching. Just do it. I'm watching. Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam. All I'm saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager's chair. And I thought you wanted that job. You come so prepared. Aspirin. Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It's really great. No. He was maybe thinking of you for it. I wouldn't be too sure about that. Just saying. Well, hello. Big day for you. Love the belt. You know, I don't know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog's outta here, so letting it all hang out! Thank you, I appreciate that. ‘Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it. No, I just applied for more overdraft protection. [cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney. Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please? Will you be the new manager? Where? Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let's go. It's good news. What? Why do you already have this? I know. Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute— I don't think so. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on—what I was about to say was Dwight—[phone buzzes] Oh, I'm sorry, I gotta—This'll be a second, sorry. Yeah. [on phone] Then we'll get him a new set of drums. [hugs Dwight] Congratulations, Dwight. [hugs Dwight] Congratulations, buddy. Congrats, Dwight. But I fought for this seat. It's nice to have you back. So. Let's hear it. Nope. Can't accept that job. It's not a real job. I'll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I'd be proud to take. Don't get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus. Hey, I didn't get a chance to say it, but... congratulations, Dwight. This is a big day for you. Tuna, I'm a performer. And perform I shall. [sings ‘I Will Remember You'—everyone is slightly impressed] Oh, Angela. But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office] The tea in Nepal is very hot. Close. Colder. No, I meant you're getting colder. The correct response is, "the coffee in Peru is much hotter." But, that's three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol? No, no. Give me the steam. It's just harmless steam to panic intruders. I'd like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd. Go get ‘em, honey. Oh, don't worry. They'll get got. Sales form for you to sign. Aw, thanks, man. No. When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he's giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he's certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim. He welcomes you. Your agenda-taking pleases him. [overlapping] Zero. No nonsense. You can't have nonsense. Hi, buddy. my wife did it. Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It's all about Phillip. I hate Phillip. I love Star Wars as much as the next guy— I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN. Potential future nonsense. I'm gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You've got a regional manager. Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager. But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager? Exactly. Yeah, right. I mean, unless they're willing to pass some tests. Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table? Members of the office, hear ye. Plop? Still? Nice. This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that's for fueling only. No savoring. He envies you. 985,000,000,000,017. Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World. Come on.Jim & Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna—Jim & [reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went." An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right? Yeah. It's real. It's the only way you'll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She's through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful! Look at that form. You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing—none of these people are good enough. What I'm about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I've ever said. Is- The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute. I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That's it. You look really, really good. I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond. All day long, it's moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs. Dwight, I'm telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight? The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm. You threw the summoning bag at me, sir? Perform a test. Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I'm gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don't worry, he's the best in the biz. Unless you think he can't handle it. Mama. Mama. Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager's office before? Beet. Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don't know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple. Hey. You wanted to see me? I am sorry he's here today but I had— How thoughtful. If he is your son, that's a great plan. But he's not. He's not your son. Can I go back to my desk now? Well I've been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn't believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help. OK, I don't have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so. I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so cr*ck the whip. What do we got? Wow! Congratulations, that's a really big step. Right in the sweet spot. I think you're gonna be really happy. [whistles] That's a lot of pros. So what is the problem? I don't know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I've been faced with a tough decision, there's only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation. Love. no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who's gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have. Not as good as you. Oh, my goodness. Dwight? Why? [getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem! Who drives like that? Can you put that down? It's too loud. Okay, yes—yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you! And I lied to you. Phillip's your son. I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.  We're getting bonus footage for the DVD. It'll be a pledge gift. PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you. In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I'm getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there's a mini-reunion. A kind of a "where are they now" panel at a local theatre. It'll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven't seen Kevin since we let him go. Speech! Yes! Wait, why? "Get out." What does that mean? What? Dwight, you can't do that. What?! Dwight...[overlapping objections] Yeah. Yeah, I don't think... I think she looks good. Now that she's wearing sports bras, we don't see her boobs as much. Thank you. [laughing] To remind you that our wedding's gonna be wonderful. D, it's gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me. I don't...I don't know why. Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He's putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I've done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight...only good surprises. "Guten Pranken". [chuckles] Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn't going to show up? No I didn't change the number. All good though. Phone never rings. Surprise! You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town? WASSUUUUP! [laughing] Get out. No, Dwight. You'll be doing the whacking. Of course I did. OH! [all laugh and applaud after Dwight fires the bazooka] Yeah, brosef. They do. Here we go! Right there. I bet you boys have a big appetite. Mm, I know what you want. I know exactly what you want. Ohh, shh. [places finger over Dwight's lips] [Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It's o...thank you. You know what? You don't have to...oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It's okay. Dwight, for the last time, she's not a waitress. If you want her to leave, just tip her. What's happening? Oh, it's the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela's been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled. They think it was Mose. What is that? Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town? Is that Mose? If you want your bride, buy us a drink! If you want your bride, buy us a drink. Well, well, well, well, well, well. That's six "wells." Did I get that number right, Dwight? Yes. I did. This one. Now get out! Ooh. Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet. Well, w... I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow's his wedding day. You can't be anything but happy on your wedding day. You're just saying that to make me feel better. Is that all it was? Come here [hugs Dwight] I missed you! Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three. You've had your drink. Now where is my bride? Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or... It's like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It's kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn't wanna know any of it. You ready? Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um... I don't know how to tell you this, but... we have a little bit of a problem. The minister just told me that it's tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom. I haven't heard of it, obviously. But I'm out because I am significantly younger than you- I think it's definitely... Well, okay. Either way... Either way, Dwight... I can't be there for you. I'm sorry. I just...really wish there was something I could do. [looks off] That's not... Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They'll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just s*ab ‘em on in there.[After Dwight and Angela's dance] Thank you go much. Great. It was really fun. If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it's that if you film anybody long enough, they're going to do something stupid. It's only human natural. Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again? And Jim can jump back in without skipping a b*at. We'll come back to visit. But I think it's time for us to officially... Dwight, come on. Don't end on a bad note. Hey, and if you're ever in Austin... There it is.

We'll come back to visit. But I think it's time for us to officially... Dwight, come on. Don't end on a bad note. Hey, and if you're ever in Austin... There it is. What? Did you see who did it? One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then. Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a m*rder or something. It was an accident. No. Hey D. Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine. I have to visit the alchy. I wouldn't put it past her. I wrote it out. Hey. Any problems? What!? Sprinkles. Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time. Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking? [sobbing] Alright. Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish. You never... you don't like them. Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you? Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects. OK, 1 Sikh, and... As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical. Excellent. Um... I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor, but... Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head. I can help you with that. Oh God, Rabies? I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD? This place is so cursed. It is going really great. Shut up. Oh, really? Yep. Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips. You got it? Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing. That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock. Back off me. No. The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab. What does that mean? You did k*ll her!? You put her in my freezer. Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out. You! [hits Dwight] It's OK. It's nothing. How could you do that without telling me? Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized. [runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit. [turns to address Jim and Pam] No way. No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest. What do you want? Oh, what is that? Her name was Sprinkles. I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground. Don't rush me. I'm grieving. I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight? This is company-wide, Dwight. We have a date! Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight? Yes. [puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in] Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you. You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit] Very much. How's your meat? I heard a joke today. Yes, it was. I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body. I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could. Smell that. Do you smell that? Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food. Thank you. Is that all? Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that? Good. Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door] No, this is my quest. We don't need luck. But thank you, that was really nice of you to say. [looks at vending machine] Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater. It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I h*t Meredith. I know. So who's next? Proceed to the highlighted route, then route guidence will begin. Who? We're with Office Depot now. Well... OK. I don't think we're coming back. OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch. [driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are? That is true. Yes, she is nuts. It looks delicious? I don't know. Then we're not coming back. No he's right. Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us. Proceed straight. I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing. Make a right turn. No, it said right, it said take a right. Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. [turns right] The machine knows where it is going! The machine knows--- stop yelling at me! No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake] Let go, let go of me! [watching car get pulled from lake] You sure you're OK? Good, that is what's most important. What a disaster, this whole thing. These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it. What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us. Hang up. [Dwight hangs up] You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket! We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand! Oh what is this? Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! [sits on couch] Look, my clothes are so wet! WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY? I ate them OK, I ate the turtles, they're gone! 00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company. Wow! Watch out Dwight. Actually it sounds like you are. Yes, please let us know. Waste of time. The website's going to win. I don't care, but yes. I don't care, and you won't. And this is where I will record your sales. I can't tell if he's mocking me. Thank you. Or a gong. Twenty seconds to go time. Really? Power gel? Okay. We start. As soon as I make... this sh*t. Aaannnddd go! What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working? [blowing air horn] Yeah! What kind of prank are you thinking? [on monitor] What is a Jim? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the first... girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with. Tie goes to the girlfriend. How's it going? Yeah? You look a little worried. Kelly ordered this online. But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, "Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin." Who knows? Hey! How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk. Start sellin' multiple reams like a man. Mmmmm. I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them. What did I intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them. If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow. [on monitor] Oh. I didn't realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples. I'm sorry. Am, so sorry. I... yes. Uh, could you repeat that? No ! [blows air horn and dances] Stop it! Gimme that! Give it! Four! Three! Two! One! Woo! After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams. Fifty-two reams! Dwight has defeated the computer. I didn't ask you to do it for me. What do you think of Angela? No, not like that, as a woman. W-O-M-A-N. You hadn't noticed she's a woman? I hear she's single and ready to mingle. I'm thinking about making a play for her. What do you think? Crazy, right? Isn't that part of the fun? She works here too, how is that any different? Fine. What kind of business is this? You're such a loser. A loser. Alright stop, stop making him say it! You just made this worse, a whole lot worse. Okay. Why are you looking at her like that? How did you, um, where did you... So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested. But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down. I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I can hear you, man. Hey, hey, hey stop it. Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no. I kidnapped a kid. I could have paid for the pizza. [to Dwight] Mmm-kay. I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent. I will open the door. And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands. Yes. [pizza guy flips him off] Okay. Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens. What a horrible day. Bluh. Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today. And you know what? I'm going to get it. Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi. New York. Wanna go? Alright, you drive. Okay. Here we go. Mmm. See you later. [mocking Ryan] I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face. I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot. I made it with my cheese pita. I started a f*re, I started a f*re. And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody... Wanna head back? [talking on phone] Sure, I can hold. Hey Dwight. Do you run the bed and breakfest? It is not a B and B. Does the Department of Health know about this? Hello, I'm looking for a room. It says here you cater to the eldery. Trip Advsior. Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see. Two? Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her. What about my cherub figurine? No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp. Fine. No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars! What are the themes? Nice. Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story. Not even Harry Potter? But you promised. Mose, bags! Now! You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less. Well, I hope this conversation has helped. [Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn. Hey Dwight. Oh yes. Ever since the storm. Yeah, yeah. Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here. Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you? You okay? Dwight, how's the hotel business? Have you checked Trip Advisor recently? Maybe you should. The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm. Dwight. Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton? Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam. Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you. I think the engineer left. You playing that game again? Oh it has losers. I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking. Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base? We'll use code names. That's not different enough. Has anyone ever come up to you and said, "You're not creative"? Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night. No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, "Oh D, oh D." Yeah. D for Andy. Oh D. This is perfect. This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone. But, you will not tell anyone. What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch. We're like Animal House. What are we doing? What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing? We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.Michael and [chanting] Utica! Utica! Utica!Michael and No, I'm not calling Karen. What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight! Are you kidding me? Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so... Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink b*mb. No, no, not real b*mb. No, no absolutely we are not doing this. What is that? Dwight, are you peeing? Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight! Michael, watch the road! Pull over, pull over! I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening. You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place. No, no, you won't do that. Nope. Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please? Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go. [from the walkie-talkie] We are in a stairwell. [from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs. Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me. There's a guy, there's a guy. Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close. No, no, don't do anything to them. I have to do something to his eyes. Aha! [crashing] We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! Jim leave us. Save yourself! Dwight, could you move over a little bit. Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back! You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so... Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted? I'm taking Stanley. OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a Kn*fe. OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. [Dwight comes back with set of knives] Hey, what... Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight. That'd be great. This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial k*ller. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead. Well, yes I would. And I would survive. Well... You... You... you are as creepy as a real serial k*ller. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK. I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing? No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to h*t Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it. [smiles] Hmm. Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out. [leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow] Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature? Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes] What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just -- Stop. Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight. Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug] [to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A Kn*fe, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really b*ating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with Kn*fe] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't h*t my corroded artery here... I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. [screams] Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter. Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious. Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day. Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those [points camera to mushrooms] are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. [puts them in mouth] Don't patronize me. [Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell? I told you. [walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing ping-pong] How's it going? I'll make the call. Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad! [on phone] This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it! [hangs up] Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday. Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate. Hey-o! Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler] What are you doing here? I hate my life. So can we come in? [crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table] It's actually really good. And now you guys are dating? I'm gonna get going. Sir, do you have any other place you can stay? Maybe with one of your friends here? Flooded. No. Nope. Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear "Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la." No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired. Well put it aside. [hangs up the phone] [Dwight enters] Umm... yeah. Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model... That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go. [on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed. She's dead? [Dwight makes Kn*fe slitting noise] She's so young. Oh, God. Oh... Try not to be so hurtful Jim. I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... [sighs] You're right. What do you mean though? Hmm. [looking at the chair model's headstone] How did she die? God. She was so innocent. You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do? Oh, you move on. [singing] Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off [with Dwight] and die?Michael/ Return. This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it. Smells good. Oh don't. That's disgusting. Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice. I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions. Dwight. Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators. Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls. I'm right here. I am going to go get laid. Goodbye. Place is packed. Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall. Hey, how ya doing? Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard. Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries. Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms? Insane. Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean? Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna h*t the bathroom. Yeah. I don't know, maybe. With vodka, you're the best. [to bouncer] Check again, Ryan Howard. Yeah? Wooo! Let's bail. [starts to leave] We're not going unless we can all go. There you go. It's for you. From them. [points to Jersey State girls across the bar] What are you doing man? [to Dwight] You have to go with me. Stay. Stay, please? Call me. This is a one time thing, you know that right? [they walk into Ryan's apartment] This is it. This is where the magic happens. One of you guys can have the sofa, and one of you guys can have... Dwight, I'm the boss. Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on. Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone. No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do? Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK? I... love it!! Haha, come on! Greatness is only skin deep, some people say... Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside... And in this case... That's also not true. What about a cat eating man food? You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker. That's a racing stripe. Mmm, I doubt that very much. How next to? I have to pick one of those? Can you go over those options again? Well I have the, the blue book value... Can I think about it? Let me think about it-- Let me think about it-- I'm thinking about it-- Thinking-- It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too. Uh huh... What's the pink? Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this? Other than me. I never said you could do that. I... Okay, I will think about it. No. Yeah... What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You're flipping my car for profit. I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me. Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding w*r for my car on eBay. Like you're applying for a loan. Yeah, and I finished my work months ago! What consequences? Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being "lured" these days. Thank you Dateline! [answers cell] What do you want? Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there? Yep. [Maguire keeps swinging]Angela and Shortcut! Shortcut! [drives cart off course, it flips over] Woah! I fell in the sandtrap! [trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.] Bless you. [Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you. [presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight. Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second... And how many would you like? Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately. Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset. Oh, thank you. I've been working out. Have you? Dwight? I'm confused... Can't do that. Unsanitary. I've married. Tell Fater. [hangs up] Such a nice woman. [watching from his office] Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow. Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already. Why do you hate her? You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me. Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do? We need to sell her an elevator pass. What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. "What do I do?"... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. "Qua" something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close. No. Which one's Kevin? [they glance over at Kevin subtly, who is stifling a giggle] Oh. Good for you guys. Yeah. Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked. That's... What do you mean, "Michael"? That's not even my handwriting. [exits conference room] Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?! No! [from outside the conference room] Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! [Michael, Toby, Holly, and Pam exit the conference room] Hey! It's the temp! Look! [everyone is crowded around Jim's computer] Is that the police? Thanks. Almost. [she unlocks Holly's car] Hey. What are you doing? What the hell is going on here?! There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight! Why did you do that? No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World w*r II. Fifty years, she is the best. [to Dwight] Take care of that, all right? Thanks for bringing that up. No. [sees Phyllis; gasps] Oh my God! All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up. [cheering] I'm taking the dumplings for my wife. I'm taking my dumplings. Dwight, Dwight! Michael, it's time. OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays. 2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control. Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only. I thought you had to pee. Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212? Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes. OK. How do you feel about Maine? [Angela picks up phone and dials] I'm on it. I'll see you later, love. [Dwight's pager vibrates, he and Angela walk out] Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it. [walking into storage room] Hurry, we have to make this fast. Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer. Oh, my God! Here we go. Everybody on. Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country? Obesity-caused illnesses. Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava. Michael, we have a situation. You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them. Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time. Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her. You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing. I should have been lovers with her first and then friends. That was terrible advice. Terrible advice! You know my seduction method. I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh--- You sabotaged me. You sabotaged me, man! How much weight have you lost, Dwight? No, you're definitely the problem. Yeah. Yes you were. Split the commission? [storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?! There was no client. Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car. I had to walk home with no money and no phone. You left me in a bad part of town! I think of him as more like... a monster? What about, "I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!" No, no, no, NO, no! You know what? Fat people are not monsters! Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject. Bang! Boom! Case in point! Look at the outside of this building. It is ugly. But you come inside... and it is beautiful. Just like this unappealing fat suit. Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man. Hey! Why don't you just sit down, please? Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march. You're right, you're right. Just, Dwight, do it. Just say it ok. I say we have a parade. I know. I suck. Dwight says "Hi." Let's meet for lunch. Yeah. C'mon we'll meet halfway. You'll be back for your 4 o'clock class. I'm gonna write you up for not working. Perfect. Yes! [they embrace and kiss] Hey, sorry everybody. Nothing. To get married. Today is ethics day. After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here. It's gonna be insaaaaane. No, it's not. I have to read from the binder. Hey-oh! Yeah. Yeah, I took intro to philosophy,twice. No big deal. A siesta! Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time? [starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn. Four seconds. Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure. Personal conversation. Seventeen seconds. Actually not. It was really so-so. [Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds. What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds? So I guess I can assume that was personal. So maybe you're not completely ethical after all. Yeah. OK, just remember to keep breathing. [drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion. Oh, OK! OK! I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital. I take Quincy Ave to Gibson. I checked the route - there are no potholes. Come on, get in here and have the baby. Yes! Yeah. [squatting and pushing] Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! All right, OK. [to Andy] Sorry. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go! Do it! Do it! Scream! Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out. Aaaaaaaa! Just keep pushing... I'm right here. I'm right here, I'm right here. [annoyed] All right. Dwight. Just push and breathe. Shhh. No, you can't have it. It's too late. No. You have to just push it out! Keep simulating. OK! Keep simulating. Yes, I do! OK. Yes. Aaaaaaaa! It's coming! Here we go! [drops the watermelon onto the floor] Oh! God! Wow! What was on that? OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up] That was a good story. Really... Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby] She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller. OK, what else? [now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one... [heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don't h*t the fence. Oh no, my child! [throwing the stroller against a high chain link fence] Don't get stuck on the barbed wire! Uh... come on. You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with? That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date. [sigh] What are you making? You're making a Kn*fe with a Kn*fe? You want to talk about it? You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know. Hi. It's nice to learn new things. Okay. What don't you get? Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk. We were robbed last night. [cockney accent] Consider yourself... at home! [Dwight groans] Ugh. Where are we going? Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on. It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much. Mm-hmm. I think you have me confused with another person. 140. 160. Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it? Now you move on. Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer. Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us. Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl. 300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice. 350. 400, 400 hey batter batter. 500. 700. So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm h*tler. I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to b*at me up. I can never tell with those two. 'Morning. [Dwight reveals Cornell sweatshirt] Wow. Good morning Dwight. Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off! Hey buddy. Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them. Come on, you think you can get into Cornell? I'm sitting right here Dwight. I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy. If you're going my way, I wanna drive you all night long! If you're going my way... Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying "we." You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me. I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red. Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling] It's pronounced "Corn-ell!" It's the highest rank in the Ivy League! Fine. Dwight! Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview. Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in? Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer. The conference room! Let's see how well you know your Big Red history. Who was Cornell's eighth president? Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par. What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention? Nobody wants ...that, to happen. "Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character." "Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations." "Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid." I have everything I need- [talking over each other] And you will be hearing from - which I will not be a part of- And YOU will not be pleased with the result! And your affiliation with Cornell - Will end completely! [Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls] I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet? What, these? Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state. Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. [attempts to bite into a raw beet, beet is too hard] You're supposed to cook these, aren't you? Hey, sport. Ow! God! Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did. No. Wow. Dwight, your feedback is horrible. A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful. No, no, no, no, no. Do I look like I am joking? If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing? It is... more of a spicy brown, actually. How was your meeting with Michael? Was it your scores? Mm-hmm. Of course. Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers. That is me. Wish me luck. Thanks. I love you, too. I'm not talking to you. Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go. [picks up phone] Hello? Wow, that's great, because I need paper. [whispers] Ask him his name. I am Bill Buttlicker. Be respectful, Dwight. Would you hold on one second? That's my other line. Sorry. That was a family emergency. Boundaries, Dwight. Come on! He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go. You're gonna have to talk louder. Son, you have to talk louder. Louder, son! Stop it! Stop it! Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today. [covers phone, whispers to Dwight] See how it's done? [into phone] Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. [to Dwight] See what I did? You have to f*re the salesman that treated me so terribly. Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view] Are you serious? OK, what are you -- What's that? Who's they? In this car? [turns radio down] What are you thinking? The mob, maybe NASA. How many shoes do you need? I'm not talking to you. Pam. [on phone] So I'd like to redouble my order, if you could put me down for, um -- I'm sorry? Hear what? Well, I am breathing, yes. I need paper. Oh, my God. You scared me. What are you talking about? You always say that, and I almost never know. Are you accusing me of something? OK. Easy. You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews. Dwight, let me see your coffee cup. Is that it? I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party. Probably just Kelly. That's what I'm saying. You were right. You were right. You knew it. You knew it the whole time, buddy. Wow. [in New York] Right Dwight is loud. Nothing's going on. What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this. OK, all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just f*re me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends. Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us. OK. [Pam and Jim look worried] Don't. We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers. Oh. Hmm. That's very generous. Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal! [shakes Dwight's hand] Um, what are we talking price wise? [in a singsong voice] Lets do this! Two are for souvenirs. I do. It's right here. [indicates to waist] No, I don't want to wear a bra. Stop it! Stop it! Dwight, can you get those please? What? [noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already? Pam failed art school. Excuse me? Dwight. Oh my God. I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee. I missed you too. [Jim kisses her] Uh, yeah. I'm not going inside. [with mouth full] Yes. So why did you come in here? [watching Toby at Phyllis' desk through his office blinds] Look at him. With his stupid face. Stupid... tan. No. No. I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved. Okay, just summarize. That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to h*t on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act. Mm. Me too. Okay, let's get this started. What are you doing? For what? No, no, no. You're the bait for Toby? No, for one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim. Or Ryan. Or me. Toby can I see those? Ooh. [takes photos and throws them on the floor] What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared? You mad? You mad at me? Do you want to do that? You want to h*t me, you want to punch me? I dare you to. Come on. What's the matter... haaaww! Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on? No do it, do it. I dare you. I'm not going to punch you, Michael. [as Toby picks up his photos] You should have h*t him man, guy was asking for it. Once in a lifetime, man. [mouth full of brownie] Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day. What's that? Frame him? I've never framed a man before, have you? Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I forgot... I forgot... Here? Those are real cops, real g*n. I wonder what's going on. [follows them] Hey, what is this? Hey, what's going on? You don't have my permission to do this. I have a reasonable right to privacy. Ahh, that's mine. Are you kidding me? That's my salad. No. We got a fake tip. No. Yeah, I can't... really can't move him. Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms... I mean, like, "156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left." "Walk until you hear the beehive." I think Andy makes an excellent point. But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom. Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench. [shudders] Whew. Hmm... mm, what's that smell? Manure. Get rid of it. Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day? Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before? See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh. [laughs] Hahaha!... well... No. I haven't thought of it. I would like cat. I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat. I want a butter sculpture of a cat! Oh... ah, I almost choked. Hey-o! I work with Dwight. What? I do. Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy. What do you mean? Dwight! That doesn't count! No, it doesn't! I didn't- We are not married. Take this thing. [takes off twine ring] Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas. Five minutes actually. I am a black belt in gift wrapping. I think it'll take you a little longer than that. Ah. You brought in your doll collection. These are not dolls, Jim. These are commodities. Same as gold or oil. That's the Christmas spirit. Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out. 120, 180... 200. Thank you so much. My daughter is going to love this. Thanks. You too. [Meredith's hair is on f*re] Oh, oh, oh, oh! Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand] Okay, no, that's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don't you have anything? No, I like Meredith. [amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no. No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting. But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on f*re today. What about tomorrow.? What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead? I s*ab her in the brain with a wooden stick. Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore. The next time you light yourself on f*re we are not going to help put you out. Dwight-- [sighs]...okay. Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that. I can get you one in an hour. This is great. My ex-wife's going to be so pissed. [chuckles] For once daddy's gonna be a hero. Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls. I was-- I was gonna get the doll. Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having sex with Dwight. I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party. Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar g*n. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard. Wow, thirteen! No. No, no. There was wind. I can't take it anymore. I am telling Andy. Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar; more forcefully] Where? [Dwight's expression implies 'at your desk'; Oscar's voice breaks] Where, Dwight? [on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself... No. Please stop. [grabs a spoon from Jim's coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon. don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. [sings] Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep. [makes chomping sound] What is it? That is a terrible idea. One of your worst. You're expanding on your worst idea. I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it? Well? This is really not how this is supposed to happen. When will she be ready? Is she crazy in bed? Okay, listen. This shouldn't happen at work. I am already walking. Okay, what does that mean? But you're leaving... [to Dwight] What are you standing for? You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin. [Dwight enters] Dwight. It's over. No. It's over between you two. You have to. [forcefully] She doesn't love you. She's marrying me. Angela Bernard. It will be her name. And you will have to call her that! I'm telling you to back down. Then I'll make you. Through the use of force. Nope. Fine! This is nuts. Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because... Guess what? Not happening at work. We're gonna do it outside. None of your business. My bare hands. 00 in the parking lot. [softly] What a coincidence. [collects Dwight's w*apon from around the office; holds up a hand scythe] [opens his office door] Yeah, finish up. I guess people have fewer choices as they get older. Hey, has anything happened yet? Oh come on, man! Believe in something. Yeah. Andy's running over Dwight with his car. Oh! You give up? I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance! Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton? Dwight! Are your legs broken? Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this! What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. What? You stupid idiot! [Andy honks his horn] You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods... I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice? What! I'm her fiance. [enters, followed by Dwight, and makes a call] Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, that's the one. Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. [sighs] Ahh! Looks like a red wire. Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires. Doesn't it? So what do we do now? I will seduce her. No, I will seduce her. No, I got it. Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support. Michael Scarn. Okay. [interrupting] No. No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP. No! [arguing over each other] Oh, don't start, You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP. You will have pancakes and you'll like it. So what? Maybe they are shrinking. They could be shrinking. Ah ha [popping something in his mouth] Yup. Mm hmm . And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business. Argh, why are you all... Shut up. Ready to do this? Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? [picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion] Is this the cup? [picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion] Is this what I drink out of? [glug noise, both laugh] Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession. Hi, I'm afraid we're not hiring right now. That's my son. Try 80. I sure hope not. So why are you considering leaving Dunder Mifflin? Hey, hey, how is your interview going? I... Okay, okay, okay, [in disbelief] alright, thank you. [heads towards Dwight, makes make out lips signal] Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time. I cannot wait to contact your clients. Haha, we struck the mother load! Wallace is going to freak. He's going to absolutely freak. Oh sh**t. Oh God, what was that? No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears] Aw, it's alright. Aw, my car. It sounded bad. No no, we are fine. You have done enough already. No, no, really not necessary. See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot. Oh coffee, that's too much. [Dwight drinks it] Gosh, well so long. [they exchange byes] Ok, goodbye Prince Family. Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye. Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information? Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine. Why don't we just, live and let live? Live and let live. It's from James Bond. I'm not going to make this call. My heart says... That is true. That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times. Jan... Ryan. I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot. You're right. You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info. Just something I have to do first. Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows] Oh sh**t! [gets to his car turns around] Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot] Those people will be ruined. [runs out back door] Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people. Okay, bye bye. Last week I gave a f*re safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention. It's my own fault for using PowerPoint. PowerPoint is boring. People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher. [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives. [throws cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid] Did you bring your jerky in again? Whoa, f*re! The phones are dead. It's out in the hall. Oh my God! Okay, it happening. Everybody stay calm. Stay [bleep] calm! Everyone, now [bleep] calm down! [groaning] Oh my God. Try a different door. Don't run. It-- it's warm. Back door. Get out of the way! Go, go, go! Okay, we're trapped. Everyone for himself. [shouting] Out of my way! Let's go. Get out of my way! Get out of the way! Move it! [pulling cat out of filing drawer] It's okay. Shh shhh. Oscar. I only weigh 82 pounds! Uh-- save Bandit! [throws cat into air duct and he falls out through the other side] Oh! What do we do? I'm about to die! What?! How could you possibly think this is a good idea? Electricity. You could have b*rned down the whole building. Did you shout, "f*re!", causing a panic? Take hedded of. Heed. Heed. Take heed of. Take heed of. Can you shove down? Instead... shove down, please. Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer. And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice. Something that Dwight doesn't like. What? [sighs] No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands. Yeah. That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man. Yes. I'm a smart guy. I'll figure it out. Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means "always be closing." Would you like to try next? Yeah, okay. You didn't maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didn't arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him. I have no idea. We bury him? He is an organ donor. Yeah. What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing? Dwight! Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy? Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy? Hi, everyone. Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret? Let's hear it. You couldn't of memorized that? It is a big deal. You almost k*lled Stanley. I don't get it. Do I stress you out? Oh... I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this. Hey, this is your apology letter. Yeah... yep. Oh, stop it Dwight. No no no no no no! Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way. That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot. Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks. That reeks, and I'm trying to eat. I think he meant personal day. Oh, ok. [Phyllis signs for the package, opens an empty box] Michael! It's really good to see you. Screw you. [Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead. Okay. Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama. [pushes Dwight's finger away] Just, easy. Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life. Screw you guys. You're dead to me. Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that. I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again. In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it. [partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding? Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons? What is that? [looks at sign that says "IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY."] It is your birthday period. Not even an exclamation point? I can't believe how bad this looks. Okay, good then. I am working on it. Six dollars. I said I was working on it. We lost the account. [over the phone] How old's Kelly? It's Mose. Who do you think it is? Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she? Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation? [sighs] I'll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around] So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! [laughs] [whispers] I've been driving too long. Stop yelling at me! I didn't do anything! Hey! What the hell's goin' on? I was kickin' it. What? Yep. Got it. Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy. My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday! Birthday. There's always a theme. Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake. Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about? You know what? I could use a little help. We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign? [to camera] What? I'm not in love with her. I'm not writing, "Horse Hunt." I don't even know what that means. [grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting. Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved? Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one. Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome. Surprise! [shakes her head no] That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television. Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping. I love it. Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each? All right. Surprise. [giggles] Thank you. I'm too excited to sleep. Thanks. [both eat cake] Ayyyy! [running from his desk] Ayyyy!Jim, Pam, Michael and Ok. I'm, uh, I'll be going.Jim, Pam, Michael and I understand that. So suck it. Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only. So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other. Yup, a little. How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm] You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this. No, no, no, no. I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too. We just need to find them. There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together. No. Not a giant net. I was thinking maybe like a mixer. Old fashioned meet market -- -- I don't think it is. Hey. Ah, still early. [sighs] So how you holding up? No. No, I meant about being single today. Meh, exactly. Eh. Oh, here we go. Hello. [two women, a blonde and a redhead, enter the office. Michael and Dwight walk towards them and Dwight extends his hand to the redhead] Thank you, Michael. I- I- believe you. Um, I work at a place that does catalogs for community colleges and small businesses. It's going very well. People are mixing, a lot of hope. Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in. Um, so [looking at his watch] it's not too late. No reason. Why do you always go to that? Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office? She could be your soul mate. Good Valentine's. OK. [Blonde stands up to leave] Look, I'm gonna go... Look, we already have a paper supplier. Hey, you don't deserve her. That was helping. It was classic. No... God. Alright. Who's there? KGB - [Dwight slaps Michael on the face] What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight] What are you doing? You, you like that? Dwight, get the door. Ding dong. Ding dong. The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs] [Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea. Woah, wow, who told you that? [same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight. I'm not taking... I'm not taking... Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary. Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets. Why do you have a diary? OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up. Yes, you did. What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary] Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us? We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking-- Umm, nacho chips. Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me. Oh, not gonna happen. Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly. Yes they are, you just don't care about the information. He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired. I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion... Right. That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom. That's why you made the decision. That's why you made... You kind of have. You cannot take the fall for him. He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do? Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight. [holds out hand for handshake] Alright Dwight. This is huge. Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea? Really? How did-- how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight? And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize. [going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight. Good work, kid. This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you. David? David? Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs] [on speakerphone] Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away. No. No dogs. It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea. No, no. Oh how dare you. You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard? Oh please. Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge... ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas. They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom. [same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true? When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours. I want to see it. I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary] Give me... Give me the diary. Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh! Who is it? Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second. Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine. If you want to come back then, that'll be fine. I get back from work around 6. You can try. That, that might work. I like it. [wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough? And classy, yeah. Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously. Yes. He is. That's what makes him classy. Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind. That's inspired. You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish. Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! [swings arm above head for everyone to come, hits doorframe] Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on! Well- You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know. I'll give it my best sh*t, Michael. Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? [several seconds of silence] [on phone] Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks. David Wallace's office. Good. Thank you. Alright. . . Cool. Any good headhunter knows I am available. Okay. No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions. That's a really... well fine, Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do? Hmm... Ehh... [in accent] well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it? Um... hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that? Potential, lots of potential. yes. It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um... That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing. So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now. Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on. Kev, c'mon. Hey-o! [applauding and cheering] [whispering] Would you please stop that? You're breathing very heavily. No it's not. Good. As I was saying... You bet. Well I do. I play. Well, maybe you should get back to work. Maybe we will someday. That's a great idea, Dwight. Yeah. What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer? I'm in it to win. C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play? What? What do you think? Thank you! Oh. Really? Why was she in this building? That's crazy. Oh my god! Hmm. Oh! [Dwight and Erin laugh.] Yeah. Just got some ice. So I'll see you guys around! They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get? Um, nerthing? Pffft. The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man. No, that's ridiculous. Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so- Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good! What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty. Really?[Dwight plays a hearty strum of the song, Andy stands and starts a banjo solo] West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River [Andy vocalizes] Take me home, country roads, to the place, I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads. [Erin leaves] Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song. Better a cappella! Yeah. Name another. Better a cappella. What's wrong with you? I think you look nice. Looking good. 'Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay. Hey. [gestures to 'Bed & Breakfast' magazine] Is this good? Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh? I really appreciate it. It's for your trouble. No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this. Yes, I do. That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go? I'm here. I'm a part of this now. Dwight, take a seat. Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately? I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed. Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused. And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week? Definitely. [on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin. Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well? I'm not following you. Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift. Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing? Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying "He's talking about you!"] [Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us? Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now? So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you? Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot? Dwight? Is the cool new guy Charles? Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright? He did. I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it] Hello, traitor. Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby. He's in a meeting. So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh? You sound worried. Wow. High score? And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown. Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want? So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy? No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no- Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet. Toward the sun. Noon. You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running] Dwight. I hope you're not recording this conversation. [Dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt] Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles. So you just rat me out? You could have said no. If you want a truce, I will give you a truce. I do too. Cooper's. [Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at? Really? That's weird. We didn't see any. What? Yeah, sure. [Michael answers phone] Yeah. Dwight, not now, we've been robbed. No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. [Pam holds up sign saying "Dwight did it!!"] You? What about our truce? On purpose? Why? Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it. Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] Bastard! Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say. [holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, "great salesman, better friend." [turns card over] "Tall" and "beets." Dwight, do you mind if we talk? If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed. Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client. Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now. Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much. Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates. What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow? Uh, hello, Dwight. Oh- That's very rude. Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our- I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin... Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month. Good, good, good. I will see you. I color code all my info. I wrote "gay son" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means "Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?" Most colors mean "Don't say it." No, they were your client. They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company. I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault- Uh, well said, Angela. Hey, David. Okay, great. Uh, Dwight come on in. Also, Jim. God, no. I agree. Really? Does he do good work or-- Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out. Okay. Hey, Dwight. Can I talk to you? Good, right? Hello. We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once] Yeah, yeah. Oh, but you didn't. I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction. Are you kidding me? Dwight. What? How'd you hear that? Great work Dwight. No, I mean, great detective work. 'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right? What are your top five cases? Because you've solved zero cases. Okay, do not go anywhere near the conference room. Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today. Got it? Got it. Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan. [scattered applause] And how about casual Friday again, huh? Reinstituting casual Friday? You all look great. What I want to do right now is try something a little different. I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting. I want you guys to run it. I want you to say whatever you want, take it away. Your meeting. Not important. [everyone mutters] Okay, alright. Yes. Yes, you have a job. Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen. You mean the clients you stole from us. Okay. Yep. "New File System". I am not changing the way I do my files. No, no. This goes for all of you. Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words. Andrew Bernard. What are you still doing not at your desk? All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order-- Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn. Stop doing rhyming poetry. Just tell them, please. God, the simplest thing. Can I address that? Okay. It's not right. I don't like it. You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary. [sighs] No offense, Jim. I think she's very pretty. I don't know. I saw a crowd. I thought there might be a dogfight or something-- Those sound too harsh. Of course. What is like a hostage? We could write a strong-worded letter. Strongly-painted picture. Can I just say something? I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly. Great. See you upstairs. Hey g*ng. Where you been? I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich. I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart. Is there anything I can do to make things better? Exactly. Exactly. This is your first complaint in ten years. Things have been generally good. Look, uh, Mr. Bart... At these prices with this service... You're not gonna find this anywhere else. No, no, no. Sir, don't listen. Who let this boy on the phone? You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time. It's okay, Ryan. Okay. Hey, hey guys. You know what I want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, Dwight. You guys gotta be kidding. That's right. I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing. Whatever you guys did earlier. Just do it, okay? Get 'em there. Get 'em there. Are you kidding me? Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along. [everyone mutters "okay"] However, I rescind my apology. All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights. All right, come. Sit down, Dwight. I'm running this meeting. [whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that. Shut up. Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on? Hi, guys. How you doing? Right. I'm sorry. Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio? So someone is going to a court. Big deal. Are you all afwaid? Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it. Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie. No. No. No. Oh, no. No. No. This is no good. I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok? [barging through office door] Alright. Here we go. What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital. I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy. I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner. Dwight! Dwight! I do. That feels good, Dwight. Right... mmmm... right there. I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, " This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you." [Angela shows Michael the papers again] No. An hour? I can't stay here an hour. No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now. But the rattler's so scary. I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle] Wanna dance, Dwight? Mind if I steal my wife? [whispering] I can do it. [whispering] What do you need from me? [mumbles in his sleep as Pam and Jim change the clocks in his office] See you later! Well... Ah, 40. Insect repellent, which we clearly need, reduces the effectiveness of SPF. Woah. Homemade? Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh] No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it. Well, I could've d*ed, so... I looked it up online afterwards. Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row? If- Uh... [laughs sheepishly] That's... ... not what I meant. [playing volleyball] I got it. [Kevin misses] Are you blind?! Can you see things with your eyeballs?! We've been out here for a while. I don't need this. [grunts in frustration] So what? Nice job, Beesly. Crystal cool. Set! Ow, my ankle! I... twisted it. You suckers are goin down! They're gonna wipe their asses with your serves! Piss all over your faces! Really funny. Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances. How do you figure? one whore. What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions- No way! You don't mean that! [running for the ball] I got it! Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot. We'll be back! Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay? All right! Come on. Dwight. Dwight. Okay. Parkour! This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital. [approaching elevator, as Michael films] Parkour! Parkour! Do me! Do me! Ow! Get off! Get off! [walking across cars in parking lot, Dwight filming] Parkour! Parkour! Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, [camera pans to refrigerator boxes, then dumpster] 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.Michael & Parkoooooour! [leaps from trailer, disappears into empty refrigerator box]Michael & [inside refrigerator box, sounding injured] Parkour! [hands Dwight a cup of water] There you go. Is there anything else I can do? [nods] Mm hmm. [confused] Mm-kay. [approaches Dwight's desk] You'll never guess what I know. Eric likes Megan. [annoyed] How do you know this? Stanly is having a midlife crisis. [with everyone assembled in conference room] Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors. Why would we call you at night? [to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs. Nowhere. Don't vaccinate it. Yes. This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away. If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare. Be quiet. Thanks T-Man, later. [fist bumps Toby} He has a doctor's note. A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house. It was on the news. That's not a very good Darryl. Hmmm. [spying at Darryl's house] Sounds like a EMDP-40. You're into trains? Wow. That's so cool. Wow, I'd love to take a look at that. Well, you know, 'cause of the trains. Uhh, oh boy, oh boy. Get over there! Get over there! I can't believe this. [mistaking Darryl's sister for Darryl] Hey you, ass****! You gonna eat all that dog food yourself? I tried to keep Michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark. You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food. Why would you think a lady is me? Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you. Cool. What? Stupidest thing I've ever heard. Alright, yeah fine so whatever... You really did it... And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister. Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second. [Michael picks up phone] Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything. If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay. Is that what you want to do? Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement? [shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them] No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic. Ah, ah, ah. Where's the "please"? We're not animals. No, not without a "please." Idiot. That is not big picture. ... Okay. That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day. You're trying to trick me. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about? Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen? Okay. And how do you feel? All right. Did he h*t you? Did you cry? Did you feel like crying? I'm just gonna write "held back tears." If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it. I'm not cr-- uhh! No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?! Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so-- Yeah. I am so pissed at this company! Yeah. Who said that? Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in] People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary w*r would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly. What the hell?! Yeah, I would, too. I say no. We would really appreciate it. Now this is getting ridiculous. What the hell? Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married. Yes. I said that yesterday. Dwight... No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke. Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe. Get out of here. Oh, my God, Dwight. There's... a name. Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn. Ok. Is that all you have on her? [in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep. Those glasses are super dark. Alright. We need some tunes, I think. You did? That was nice of you. Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in. Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room? One moment while I check. Oh, ok. Unfortunately, sir, the block only applies to the rate. I'm afraid we're all sold out. Yes. Schrute. Sure. No problem. Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room. I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight. I would do the same for you. Yes. Yes... just go-- Oh. Thank God. Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why. If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay. Ok. I don't have a room? Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.' [laughs] No no. She's my girlfriend. Hey? Can you make room at the head table? Why would they make the bad man a boss if you're so much smarter? Ewwww! Head table, where I belong. Well, who's that one? What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight? That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider. That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope. That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. [no one is laughing] What are you wearing? Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight. Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice. Wait. You're worried about your horses? That's cool. How many horses do you have? Nine and three-quarters. [talking to an attractive woman] Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar. Yes. Why? Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you. They're men, Dwight. [over phone] And Dwight. Mmm! It's after midnight. [points at Jim]Michael and You're married. [hugs Jim] He's married! That's not how that works. Oh my God. You're not going to be able to talk back. She'll be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons." [Dwight laughs] "And... and clip my toenails." Okay. Hmm-hmm. Yeah. So you sure you don't want breakfast? It's the most important meal of the day. That's really sweet, Dwight. So I'll see you at the wedding? K. [they kiss] Bye. [passes Isabel] Hey, good morning. [to Dwight] It's about damn time. I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half. [walks into hotel room] Oh my God, Dwight. This room is a pit. [watching Dwight eat breakfast] How can you eat like that? Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself. She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger. She was from Europe. Uh-huh. No. Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me? She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe? No... you're crazy. She's-- okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in. It-- it-- Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory. [holds up painting] And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me. No. No, but I'm allowing it. Just come here. Hello stranger. How do I look? Um... [shakes head] nothing. Anymore. Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes. What? [sighs] What do you think? Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman. He drives an SUV! Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob? Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down! Um it is, Grotti.Andy and No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it. Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences. [reads email] "I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business." Yeah. [hangs up, rips cord from phone] That is the stupidest thing you could do right now! Shh! That's not gonna happen. I was thinking exactly the same thing. Dwight... Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting. Okay. Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a w*apon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing. Should I change? Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it. Oh my God! Hi. If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy. I don't, I don't have to have that. That's okay. I don't... Okay, okay okay. Yep, all right. It was before, my tech- my technical training. Do it. Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow? Okay. I had to make a snap decision Dwight. It was a lot of snap decisions. Yes! All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks. He's alive. So you're welcome. Yeah, some of that existed before. You're right, that is new. Well I don't see that happening. Are you saying- That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain? That seems a little far-fetched. Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened. No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy. His background is perfectly clean. He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman. You suck! And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance. No. What do you mean? What? So I looked him in the eye and I said, "Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead." I said something like that. Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there? Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind. [gasps] It is? It's good to be home. Do we have a conversation scheduled? Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you. [duck voice] You're welcome! [quacks, laughs] I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing. It's a real handsome duck. [screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window] Okay. [sighs] Feels good. I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner. [both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better. I know, right? Who wants to help the world one step at a time? [Dwight raises his hand] Alright, good. Shut up Oscar. What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother! Hi Dwight! Well, I think I have that persona. What the hell is a mallard? Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me. If you take it back, I'll scream. Twenty. [walks into his office and sees the mallard back on his desk] Dwight, you brought the mallard back. [speaking into the mallard and looking a Dwight] Hi buddy. A wooden duck? Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage... Silence. I won't. But, you will wash and buff our car. I'd rather not say. I asked for a list. [Dwight rides in on a tricycle, laughing diabolically] ...and a clown. It rained. Ok. Yes. And when you fell in, did you flounder? We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right? [writes 'Koi pond' on the list] Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on. Your nose? Oh my. That is small. What keeps your glasses on? No, no. Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem. Jim, you let Michael fall in. I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away] Judas. Thank you. [reaches for bagel] Wow. H & H. You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels? Thanks. Oh, don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one. Morning Dwight. No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers. Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs. Well, yeah... It worked. I don't mind if I do. I'm taking one for my lady friend. Brain food. Thank you very much. Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me. Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Geez. When did everyone get so cynical? Oh, no thank you. Oh, Dwight. I have a little surprise for you. Yes! [they laugh] And I wanted to return the favor. I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory. Feel it against your cheek. You give me a gift-- Bam! Thank you note. You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP. You do me a favor-- Wham! Favor returned. Do not test my politeness. Whoa-- Thank you very much. Now I've got it for you. [holds open door] Is that right? Huh. [laughs; follows Dwight] That really works. Hey-- oh, hold on a second. Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus. Whoa-- thank you very much. [takes off Dwight's glasses and blows on them] Oh boy. [puts Dwight's glasses back on Dwight's face] You are very welcome. [pulls out Dwight's chair] Have a seat yourself. Not necessary. You didn't have to do that. [singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food] Andy bought lunch. Yep, yep. Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness. You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone. Whoa, whoa Dwight. I'm going to do this. No, I insist. Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous. [reaching for something on the top shelf] Ahh. Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me. What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something? That is a recipe for a ghost. It's like a little envelope-- there you go. Surprise! [laughs] It's from everybody. $15 value. No. You were right. I don't know. Ahh... [Dwight is holding a frozen chicken to his face] Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight. No. What are you talking about-- Forget that. No. Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change. OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know. No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace. OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you. So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it? And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two. Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool. You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand. It was hilarious. Yes? You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day. Woo hoo, shout out! Oh God. Well, that's an interesting theory. Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that. You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK? [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the p*stol was kept. No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing. Alright, a plan it is. It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter. I know you did it! No it ain't. I thought it was for real. So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game. I already declared you, it was too dark to tell. This is not a game, this is my life. You are out of order, sir. You are out of order. [laying on the ground] I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks. Super. [Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary g*n at each other] I didn't do it! On the count of three we're all going to put down our g*n. We'll put down our w*apon on the count of three, you ready? [Dwight enters dressed as Recyclops] Not again. Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops. The next year he really stepped things up. A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape. Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was att*cked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember. Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops. Oh, is today Recyclops Day? I thought you were k*lled by Polluticorn. That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment. Lose the twirl. [everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo] Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that. Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs. Definitely. Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed. I will have to answer. Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park. Kay. For those of you with questions, please line up behind one of the four microphones that have been placed in the aisles. Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts] Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis? Sure. Excuse me? It'll just be a second. ... and we're confident. There are many things to be optimistic about in Dunder Mifflin's future and one of them is here with us today. Michael Scott, Scranton Branch manager. The gentleman in the, uh, glasses. Thank you. Thank you for your suggestions. Jim's talking to Michael right now. They totally went for our idea! Yeah! Your idea. Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse? Not much. [laughs] Thanks Dwight. You're creeping me out. I'm gonna go. Let me guess, you think you should get it. Well, in an ideal world... Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away "Survival Skills" and "Self-defense." Wow! Hey. Jim said that? Jim said that? No, no, that makes total sense. Sure. [puts in the twenty] Are you kidding me? Dwight? Okay. That's fair. How is that possible? No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible? "It could only be you!" Way to go. David Wallace's office. No, he's in his weekly staff meeting, can I take a message? Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam. [imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson. Jim Halpert is a menace. I really don't know how it happened, David. Uh, hey, I'm sorry. I'm taking this out on you. It's been crazy here. You know I think you're doing a great job, right? Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend? Okay. See you. See you tomorrow, Dwight. How's it going? Good day? Um, okay, so, um, listen. I know about your diabolical plan. I found a copy of it in the copier tray. Too loud. Too, too loud. Too Loud. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Good. My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed. No, it's not "ugh." It is... office camaraderie. Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it? Why would you start so high? No. We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together. Pam! Yes. We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree? Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus! Yeah. Aw, Michael! How do you know it's a g*n? Not a g*n. Well, unless the missing piece is a g*n, you don't have a g*n. This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch! [on karaoke microphone] Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit? You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some... jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room. "It's fun to stay at the -" What? David told me on the phone. David told me. Earlier today. What? David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse. Yeah! [office erupts in cheers and applause and hugs] It's a Christmas miracle! Woo hoo! [climbs on desk, stage dives into crowd of employees] [singing] I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone. [Meredith and Madge help right the Christmas tree] [opens "New Moon" poster] Jim.... Jim! [Hugs him] Oh! You got it? What is that? [Dwight building his gift] Huh. Well, maybe those will help. [puts bag of walnuts on his desk] Right, Matt. [Matt leaves] I know what I'm doing, Pam. Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays. - follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the cr*ck HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two. [Toby's chair spins around to reveal Dwight filling in for Toby] So, um, the manager, Michael Scott... is a bit of a character. What are, are you doing at my desk? Come on, Dwight. Get out of here. That's, that is true. [clip montage] Have a great day. [extended Lazy Scranton video] Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'. They call it Scranton! The Electric City. Scranton! The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider. Plenty of space in the parking lot. Snack att*ck time. They call it Scranton! The Electric City. Scranton! The Electric City. Scranton! The Electric City. Scranton! The Electric City. Scranton! Oh! [rips open cardboard box] Wow. Awesome. [distributing items] For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you. Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control - Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened... And distributed things which should not have been distributed. Well, maybe we can put the box back together. Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. [holding up photo of him and Wallace] You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons. We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right? Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre. I don't know what they're made of. What? No. No. [to hotel employee on phone] We're trying to look it up right now. Um, come on. Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation. Oh. Yeah, we changed it since it was a while back. I do apologize.Michael and [to Dwight] Hello. Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room? I think that's it. So we're all good! [many employees raise their hands] Thanks ya'll. Mm! [on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88... [walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster! Just admit you lost track of time. Did you see Saw? No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw? Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment. Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something? Yes! We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't k*ll him, obviously. I have a mask... Well suggest something else then! Don't just... Don't just criticize my idea! [on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there. Nick. Like Frodo! Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum. Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum. Nice! Why not? It's part of the sales experience. It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all. Uh, yep. No, I actually don't. I think that you should call the cops. You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps. And you guys are okay with this? Yep. Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael! Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel. I would love to. [elevator doors close, then reopen in the lobby] Why not? Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know. [on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave... Yeah, I'm pregnant... Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks. [on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby? Oh, thank you very much. I'm excited. Oh, definitely. There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it. [on the phone with a client] Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay. [as Nick looks over at her] What are you looking at? Did you know that labor can last weeks? Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself. Excuse me? Good afternoon. What is this? Of course. You know I was thinking... I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy. [reading from various books] Five to seven minutes. Five to seven minutes. Six minutes. Different, but not really. Five to seven minutes. Jedediah. Jedediah. No Star Trek names. What if it's a girl? Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here. No. I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please! The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus! I didn't know we had a tape measure. Dwight, what is the traffic like? Alright. Geesh, Dwight! What!? Where? Okay, go, go, go, go! Let's go! I'm texting about you, okay!? Pull over! Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go. [as he calls Dwight] Ready? Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday. Dwight! Go to my house. Get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is under... Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the... It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here. Okay, I'll just go get the other guy. Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you? I look forward to it. [entering the Halpert house] Hello? Dwight? What, what are you doing here? Wow, ha. New cabinets. All I did was bring macaroni and cheese... Where's the fridge? Oh... Well, I'll let you get back to it. Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too. Yeah... [smoking a cigar] There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love. And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today... I think I'm going to be sick... And now you, two forms of ID, please... Alright, all is in order. I just need your signature... What is it? Alright. How would you like to celebrate? Hey... [reveal Dwight's Mega-Desk] What do we got here? Of course. Hm hm. Okay. [Pulls desks apart] Just gotta... Okay. Come on! Jim! No. [re-enters bullpen from kitchen.] No. No-no-no-no-no. [swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine? Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone] It is. Big time. Pretty amazing. Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons. Is that what happened to you? That's a common mistake. And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now. What? Right. Yeah that's great. Great. [Whispers] Please stop that! Can you grow up? [On business call] Yeah.Andy and No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--Andy and You know, can I call you back?Andy and That would be great, thank you.Andy and Oh, you don't become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off. [Scoffs] You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both! Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles "Cat's in the Cradle" song] Sorry Sugar. What'd you want? Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you. Oh! No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk. Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk] When are we getting to sales topics? Dwight? I would like your undivided attention, please. make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order. Yeah. M-hmm. Is that all you have to say to me? Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out! Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering] Michael's stupid scavenger hunt. [taps car] Lincoln. [holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too. The leads are in? Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'. You are never going to find them. I'm going to enjoy this. [muffled] I'm still enjoying it. Turn the trash. Turn the trash. It's coming off anyway. If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads. Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself. I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up. You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me. [kicking through rubbish at the dump] You've changed, man. Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent. No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight. Assistant to the managed him - Yeah. You think you would have done better without me? Really? Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you - You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies - That's my wife you're talking about, man. If I wanted to h*t you, I would have h*t you. No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. [they throw volleys of rubbish at each other] No, time out, time out. [Michael inspects a box, then hurls it at Dwight] Time in! Don't even think about that [Dwight begins rolling it towards Michael, as he reaches him Dwight kicks it and falls backward. The spool comes to a halt in front of Michael, and Michael pushes it towards Dwight.] Okay, Dwight. Here we go [picks up a sink, spills dump juice on his pants] oh god. We're never going to find those leads, are we? [they both sit on the edge of a claw-footed bathtub] This [picks up racquet] Why would somebody throw that out? Yeah, she does - she loves purple. [Dwight sniffs it] Does it stink?  In the dump. No! Better! Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat. How many is that? Count the last one. Oh, new record! My respect. [everyone returns to work] Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups - Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down. And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that- Mm-hmm. A girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this. Do you? Oh, air hockey, basketball, we could play that. Oh, whack-a-mole. Three brothers. Two are in the Marines, one's a cop. No. I love meat. O-negative. Universal donor. Universal donor. [startled by Angela, curses] [Isabel and Dwight playing whack-a-mole] You are amazing at this. How did you get so good? Whack! Whack! This looks like a hoot. Whack. Okay. It's no worry. I could see enjoying that. But we signed the contract. I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen. Well, I think that he could counter that move. The Scranton strangler is a professional strangler. Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute. You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court. What are you talking about? Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me. Did he not tell you that? Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract? You'll see me in small claims court! No. I won't say it. It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street. Mm-hmm. Thank you. I do. I literally did not know that existed until this moment. What's up? No, no, he's right. That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump? You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay? Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know? Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight. And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that. Great. Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology. Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] "Or cookies." You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the g*ng. Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight! Guten tag, Herr Michael. Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple. I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company. Sounds all right. Oh, this is "Print in All Colors," Sabre's minority executive training program. I didn't say "a'ight." You have to be a minority. Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities. Hmm? I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something? [on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing. I don't know if she was white. Yeah. Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right. Never thought of myself as an executive before. I can't think of any CEO's, any race. I could be the Indian Julia Roberts. Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes] Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy. Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky. Okay... Oh, that is so good. Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me. Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in. And then the two of us are cleanin' house. What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point. What? Yeah, but she's not white, though. I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though. Namaste. Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door] Holy cow. I'd be so happy. I know. I meant I'd be happy for them. Dwight, I know these programs. "Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow." Mm! Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is. For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them. What are you doing? God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves] Why? I don't need translator. Great. Thank you, Dwight. I'll never forget everything that you've done for me. Because I never forget anything.  Stop what? It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, "I will when you lose the baby weight." It's a pen. Get back to work, Dwight. Please. That's fun. No, Michael, no. All right. [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, "I love you." Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's k*lling me. [whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator. This is you. How much do you charge? I'll give you $50. Money's no object. Okay. Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said "Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient." [smiles] Oh, hi. You work for Michael. Right. Donna, hi. [sighs] All right. [calls Dwight] Thank you. You okay? [chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about. Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here. Nope. I'm good, thanks. Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat? Get out of my way. Huh! I'm out of here. You stay away from me, or I'm calling security. You're back. What happened? No, what happened with Donna? Ugh! No. No! Are you sure? Who eats eight protein bars? Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over. What? No, she didn't say that. I'm the mistress? Excuse me. Yeah, I'd appreciate it if you'd just let me run this. Don't listen to him, we're approaching a cooldown down a gentle hill. No, guys, no. We're just cooling down... Okay, alright. I would k*ll Bin Laden and then Toby. Yes, we s*ab Toby through the heart with an icicle. [shouting] Toby, just do it! God! Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left] No, out! Get out now! Leave now. Leave! Hello! No. Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract. Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over. Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it. I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting. Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red] Same page. Go to the next one. Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix-- This is essentially... Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor. Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract. So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000. What? I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism. He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune. Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document] Look, I don't think that's actually legal. Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela] Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses. Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy. I want eye contact. Yes. You'll learn, baby. You'll learn. Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes] I could have stopped him. No. What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location] Well, it better work. Please. Hey Dwight. Mind if I get in there for a second? Just one... [Dwight pushes Nick's neck to the desk and pushes his arm up] Gah! Ah! Dwight, what the hell? The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother. Okay Dwight. Well, I'm inclined to believe you. Yeah, I noticed you've had a great year. Good boy... you turning that money into more money? I don't like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain't investing in property, then you're dumber than a dummy. Okay. You can count on me. I'm hungry. [on phone] The property you're looking at is in great shape. By the way, it has a very spacious basement office. [on phone] I just need you to come by later and sign a few forms. What time works for you? [Dwight looks across the street] Mr. Schrute, what time works? Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels? Who is the whistleblower? You, you guys have fifteen parties a week, you can't learn my name? I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too. You don't say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston. People say I am the best boss. They go, "God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious." "And you get the best out of us." [shows the camera his WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts. Whassup! Whass...up! Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing? What are you doing? It's not on your desk. It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation. Why not? [crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me. Downsizing? Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight. Assistant to the Regional Manager. Can't you just tell us. You don't know what it is. [Laughs] I don't need your permission. Can you promise that? Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings. Introduce yourself. Be polite. Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything. That's his profit. New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos. OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here? [Laughing] That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim. What is that? No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food. How do you know it was me? Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop. Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores. Do you really have to do that right now? Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight. That is not the expression. You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go. Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out. Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him. Um... Well, we only have an hour. Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness. Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you? OK. Ok, you're thinking of a superhero. No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that. Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me. That's nice, Dwight. OK, I like your food. OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver. Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it. Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train. Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan. You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace. Nope, you cannot use it. Temporary workspace. You can use it. If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already. What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people. Dwight, what... It says "workspace". If it's the same thing, then why did you write "workspace"? You are not my superior. OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan? This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything. You cut more than you had to, didn't you? Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance? OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies. Why would you want to raise your cholesterol? Is it a good plan? Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts? No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK? Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I...lovehim. OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential. OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway? Damnit! Damnit Jim! What are you talking about? OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake? Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created k*ller nanorobot infection. Absolutely not. No I didn't. It's an epidemic. Sounds tough. Do you? Mmm hmm. Yep. Good luck. [closes door and locks it] [answering phone] Jim Halpert. Who is this? No, you can't f*re me. Hey Pam! How are you? I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to? I have nothing to do. Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything. The mall? Hello? This is Jan. Who is this? From sales? Where's Michael Scott? Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand? Really? OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately. No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again. Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it. [under his breath] Oh, Christ. I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options. What about confidentiality? Could you mean vag*na? Because if you do, I want that covered. A uterus is different from a vag*na. I still have a vag*na. That's a real thing. Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits? Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] "Hi. I'm Mork from Ork." Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. Oh! God. Dwight, come on... There's no downsizing. Assistant to the regional manager Dwight. But there's no downsizing, so just don't... It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Tr*mp is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, "You're fired." [as Donald Tr*mp] "You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed." It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. [as Donald Tr*mp] "You're foir-ed." I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, "You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want." But that's unrealistic, so... Why'd you do this? Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip? Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out. Absolutely, I do. At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me. To what? And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says "No, Jim, here's a way." Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground. Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products? What? No. What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam. Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing? But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away. [to the camera] Can you get her? She's right there. [camera zooms in on Meredith at here desk] That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. [laughs] Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, "Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers." Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, "Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael." [pretends to vomit and laughs] Yeah, what do you think that's about? You are not going to believe this. Well, tensions were high in the kitchen. Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off. Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking... Their bread is very good. OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off. OK, yeah. [looking at birthday card] Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath. Yeah. What do you know about Meredith? There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend. I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside. [laughs] Which one is that again? Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus? OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday. I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there. What? What? [gives Dwight a high five] Great. I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision. Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open. I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe. So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box? Right... That's good. [on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that... [looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about? Come on. Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves. All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. [Ryan holds up his bag] Very good. Excellent, excellent. Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you. No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior. [to camera] When I let him come to my pick-up game... [to Dwight] I vouched for you. I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar. Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and b*tch and I don't want to have to deal with that. Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager. No, it's not. It's lower, so... It's close. I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings. Nerd. That is why you're not on the team. No, no, ridiculous. Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight. Sorry Phyllis. No, I'm team captain. No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager. No. Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys. Aw, come on Dwight. On. Just put it on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here. [Jim saves the ball from going out of bounds and passes to Michael] Here we go. Three! [sh**t and misses] Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone! De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap]Michael and Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight! Dwight! This is a cold pack... Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else. It's illegal. Can't do that. Next best thing. All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse. Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm against v*olence in the workplace. Nobody cares what you think. So do you like the periwinkle and the purples? She'd be perfect for you. So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager. Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss. Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there. Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you h*t a stall you have a perfect fall back. You buy a purse. Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ? Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them. Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her. I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So.. No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto--- No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not. But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later. She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home. Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot... No. I cannot promise you that. Listen, Dwight. Yeah, uh no. I don't think so I'm really busy. I can't. I really can't. No. Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah, it was. We're not laughing at you, Dwight. Um, just something somebody wrote. [laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall. [whispering] It's about Michael. Dwight, get out of here!![The door swings open and Dwight is being pushed out by Phyllis] What were you doing in the ladies room?! Why were you peering over the stalls?! You are a pervert! You, are, a pervert! Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh. You're taking away our bathroom? But where would we...go? Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now. Just don't, don't talk- Don't talk- Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us. Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever. [clapping] Best Dundies ever. Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.[Quick cut to everybody talking and ignoring Dwight] "You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-"[The music stops, Michael looks back at Dwight] [to Dwight, in a low voice] Shut it. [normal voice] Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight. No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy. And I was about to take her bra off... ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork- Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on. He's a volunteer. Dwight come on, come- I'm sorry, you're gonna have to put your clothes back on, people are trying to eat. Great work tonight. Excellent. I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer. That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational. Um, I... Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot. I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have. No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was? That's what she sai [clears throat] Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself. Hey Dwight. Sure. Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that. I should get back to work. Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate. Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you. Oh. Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough. Sign the papers at the condo. Uh, I don't need one. I don't need a representative. No, No. No. Dwight. I'm fine. Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal. Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work. Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come. As my associate. No it is not. Ok. See you soon. I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing? What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't... please... I... Just... Would you put it up? [roof opens] Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner. Home, sweet home. Nice to meet you too. Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um. Are we ready to sign some papers? Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that. This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. [points at wall] Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall. I'm putting my bed right over here. Well, then I will get a warrantee. Well then I won't get a warrantee. So that's the problem, is solved. What? And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow. Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total. Ok, ok, ok. Alright. Ok. Alright. Oh boy. Actually yes. Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me. Oh, man. I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun. There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today. Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities. I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone. What the hell is a terrarium? Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place. Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it. We take separate cars. Why would we do that? No. EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok. A little bit more and I would have had it. Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst. Nobody likes beets. Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet. Stop it! [smacks Dwight's arm] Time to b*at is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys? Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er? Get up here, Dwight. Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs] [to Ryan] [makes clicking noises like sh**ting a g*n] Hey! [in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... . Okay! Everybody! Do not panic! Safety partners. [in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright. [in phone] No, no. Finish the... Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides! Go, let's go. This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow! Oh, you say that every time. Oh, boy... Alright, let's go, let's go. Come on, you're safety partners! You're safety partners! I'm okay! Let go of me! Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That's rule number two. Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower. Uh, okay, two? Okay... uh, sorry? ...I don't. Um, yeah. Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges. Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game. I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code. I guess. Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight. Nice. Smart. ...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene... [to Dwight] Don't... Come on, egghead. Let's do it. Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer? Okay. Yes! It was a trick question. Okay, Dwight. You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about. For instance, why don't you go to business... I am. Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will. Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie. Sometim... . Who goes to business school? He does? You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'. You should tell him. What? You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them. Yeah. You're right. Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So... What's that? Yeah. Uh, I better tell somebody. [to fireman] Excuse me, sir... Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh. Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school. Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan? Toaster Oven 101? Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a f*re. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans. [singing] Ryan started the f*re! It was always burning--- [sing gibberish to "We Didn't Start the f*re"] [singing] Ryan started the f*re! It was always burning... I'm really sorry, Dwight. What? Was it worth it? I'm really sorry, Dwight. The f*re guy! The f*re guy! Oh, man. Okay, I have to f*re somebody. Oh, yeah. What are you? A monk? Well, I don't really have two heads. So... Who do you think it should be? No, Jim brings in money. Eh. It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to f*re the least popular because it has the least effect on morale. [turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who? You're right, I didn't even think of him. Yeah, that's actually a really good idea. Yeah... I could. I'm not saying that's what he said. [listening to his head] What? That is not a very nice thing to say about him. Are you kidding? I agree. He'd land on his feet. Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay. No. To the. So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it? Ahh, come on. I don't wanna f*re Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away] [whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number? Oh. [fixes his dress] Jim... Oh, God. Fantastic! What?! That would've solved all my problems. Oh, you idiot. If you left, I wouldn't have to f*re anybody. Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back? You can call. Can you call 'em? That is weird. Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk. Okay, calm down. Where was the last place you saw it? I think you should retrace your steps. Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot, hot, very hot. [On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model. I know. Uh, yeah, ream. Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work. [On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list. Hold on one second... Umm... You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks. Was that your mom? Oh, I thought it was your mom. Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool. Ok. Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist? No I'm not. umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt] Ok, say please. Please? Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou. Could you practice on the forms? Ok, Roy? Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen. Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link. You know a ton of fourteen year old girls? Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'... ... he cried at the end of it. He did. Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid? Ok, here we go. Alright, come on. Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh! Yeah. [Jim opens office door for Michael] Thank you. Yes. Hi-yah! Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight. Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you. No, Really? Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22. me punching you and you hitting the floor. Really? No, they must have class. Look... Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright? Shi mate! What the hell was that? No. Alright, that's the way you want it. I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him. I got his pants. Ok, break. Break. You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. [Michael is using his head guard to h*t Dwight] Eight points. Nine points. [Begins to hock a loogie] Open your mouth. [knock at the door] Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya? Ok, to what? This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute? I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that? And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager. I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it. No, no, title change only. No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now. Absolutely but not really. Yes you do. Ok, let's do this thing. [to Pam] Wish us luck. Oh yeah- Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy. Dwight- Do you want to play- Sir, you have some messages. They're important. "I love you". That's from me. Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk! Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of "Oklahoma" in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good. Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight. Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter g*n and sh**t the- Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet? I forget it, brutha. Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops. D-W-I-G-H-T. Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so- Goin'. Ok. Where we goin'? Doesn't matter. Goin' to the go go. [nervous laugh] Oh-ok. Hello, Dwight. Who. Uh, no, no, no Gould. This is none of your affair because she is your boss- No. Thank you. Done. S'ok. You're not having sex. Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that? Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again. [plays Jan's message] "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you". Ok. We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders. No, we don't. Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease. I win. Wait, wait; one thing. Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right? 15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a... No, that was unbelievable. You didn't see it? "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?" Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. [to Jan] That happens occasionally. Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it? Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. Alright, next suggestion. Arrr, dooby dooby do. "You need to do something about your B.O." Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about t*nk. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. "You need to do something about your coffee breath"- Ok. Let's keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow. Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion. "Don't sl-", ok, that's blank [Dwight picks up note] Don't, just put it- Where did you get your outfit? Look- Oh my God... No, Dwight; come in. What do you want Dwight? You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave. Why on earth would we give you a raise? You do? How do you get in? Oh! Michael, for God sakes! Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that? That was deer!? Gross, oh! Oh, did not! No. Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you. [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light? That's from Superman? [Jim bows to Pam; she bows back] Thank you. Yes. AH! Guh-oood. Please don't do that. I can't tell you. I don't have to tell you anything. Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr! That's strong! I'm not going get a brain- Stop it. Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose. I gotta erase a lotta stuff. A lot of stuff. I know. Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with. One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental. Who do you think he should choose? Ummmm... [to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes! Thank you! Oh, uh, no. Could- Could, keep that down. Because not everybody knows about the party. Umm, Michael. Because it's a surprise. Uh hmm. So, don't tell. Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hangin' tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy. That's, whatever stupid show you want- We're watching it. I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight. You, too, Dwight? Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention. We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy. Hey, you must be Dwight! Hey, I love the Birkenstocks. Uh hmm. Oh, uh, later-ish. [singing] Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore. Here we are. Oh god. No, no, turn it around. You'll break it. All right. Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! [laughs] Nice, huh? On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three. One, two, three. [they lift and start to move a desk] Do we have one? Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work. That makes sense because he has elfish features. It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan. I know how to plug something in. I think the tree looks nice. Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth." Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of .. Yep. That's exactly what happened. There's a little more to it. What? Oh, sh**t. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right? Should we just keep opening up the presents? And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice? That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen. Damn it. I really want the iPod. [opens present] "In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute." Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod? I never said it was better than an iPod. Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand. That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, sh**t. Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories. Got to be kidding me. I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it? Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck. Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you? You don't even drink tea. Okay .. I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't. Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to. Hey. I don't know. I'm in. Hey. What's up, buddy? Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good. Who, Steve? Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup. Um, I don't think so, I just bought it. I love these. Oh, there it is. J1. Here, you know what? You can have some nickels. Hello, everyone. The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship. Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... [to Stanley] We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan. So, okay. Okay... Uh... usually it's a woman. Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you! Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing. Hey, come inside and talk to me. Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm. Okay. Wow! Never, ever, ever give up. [panicked] No one wants to pick me up!? I'm not sick! I'm b*rned! Oh... Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight. Ha ha ha. So where are you shipping... No, your job is being my friend, Pam. OW! God! What? No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot. What? Part of your duties are to what? You just said "part of your duties are to" something. Yes, you did. What is wrong with you? How strange. Because they always have yams. You've seen one of these? Roy gave it to me for Christmas. I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it. Really? Oh! Ha, haha. Uh, ow. Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN! Really? Yeah. Throw it. I promise it won't break. Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player] What?! That is so cool. Thanks Dwight! No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you? It's alright. [sigh] I b*rned my foot!!! Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there! Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins. I, barely know him... Slowly, slowly. Let's just get to the elevator. What are you doing? What, stop... [Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop. You can't lay down. Wake up. [sprays Dwight] I'm just gonna get... Get up, get up. Just keep him awake. I know. I know. I just want to say goodbye ok? Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different. It's just hard to explain. Oh my goodness! Come here. Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around. Come on, get inside. Dwight, what are you drinking? Oh my God, Dwight, put that down. Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight] Give the bottle to Michael! Give it to me. Dwight... [to Jim] You just keep your eyes on the road. [to Dwight] Give me the bottle or you're fired. Give it to me Dwight. Michael stop. Stop [sprays Michael] Stop spraying me! Gimme the bottle! Dwight, what is your middle name. Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight] Hi Dwight. [to Dwight] So, I'm ordering a CAT scan. Does the skin look red and swollen? Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off. Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up. We'll, see you when you get out. Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog? Gotcha! [laughing] Oh, God. [low] Crap! Nothin' how ya doing? Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring? Anything. They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind. Well I say that an empty desk means a... No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say. He's out sick. Whhh... What are you guys doing? Yes. On a Friday? [Dwight nods] I will do all the talking. Hi, Oscar its Michael. Yeah, I feel terrible about it. I feel nauseous and my heads k*lling. I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish] He sounded sick. That's exactly what I was thinking. [singing] Can you hear me, they talk about us... Yeah, I think I can handle it. I think. [Michael presses a button for Stanley] Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it. Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen a little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy. Not so much. Nothing. Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets. Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material. Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is. Ok. Great. That's a communal bowl. Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know. Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle? Ok, it was the second one. I hate you. Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes. You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me. Ok. Who's this? Are you going to tell Michael? How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor. Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing. [as cleaning lady with mask leaves] Here she comes. All cleaned? Great. [walks into office] That is worse. [putting his feet on desk] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old bullpen. Don't ape me. This is great. The pressures of my office are insane. I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know? I used to sit right here. Yeah. You know who used to sit at that desk? Mm-mm. Todd Packer. Yeah. He was, but, uh... that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes. [whispering] Dwight. Let's send up Accounting. Hey, Dwight.Michael and [as they throw accountants' files and supplies around] Ahhhh! Whoo hoo! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Sales rules! Yeah! Oh ho ho [laughing] No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that. You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense. Stop. Stop it. [Dwight hangs up] Stop. It. [Dwight beings to dial] Don't. Don't. All right. Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good? Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on! God, this is gonna be fun. You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage. [in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone? What is? Let's just clap. Ready? [clapping] Yeah! Yeah! We have nowhere else Jan. This... Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months. Guys! Want to start unloading the truck? Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life. Ponies. How about rainbows? It totally sucks. No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what? But we get paid a lot less. Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO. Nope. The opposite of that. Ok, good. I probably will, why do you ask? Yeah. So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great. I dunno, it's onyourdesk. It was there when I sat down. This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey [points]. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? [walks over] OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were [Conan O'Brien walks in front of Michael], OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. [to camera] Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh. Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it. I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day. Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... [awkward silence] You can't f*re me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here. You need to get something for your girlfriend. Tightly wound? Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is. No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her. That you remember her. I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane. Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then... Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say. Ryan! Hey, Dwight. You all right Ryan? Pam! Cugino's pizza. That's what she said! Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon? Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year. That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act. When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'. That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time. But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company. Well, if you have a question, you should ask me. Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot. [stand up comic voice] But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class. Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? [stand up comic voice] The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs! I do. Both of them. Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars! You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them. It's unbelievable! Do we know anyone who was in the accident? Why would this affect our bonuses? Is Brad okay? Are we out of jobs? Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today. No. We're not. Which means absolutely nothing. Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go? Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip. You know I majored in Public Speaking in College. Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority. The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did. Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your ownbutI wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at. I hope you don't mind. The very best of luck to you, Dwight. Dwight, how we doing? Good luck. That is a tough crowd. [clapping] [clapping and cheering] [clapping and cheering] Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia. [claps] Alright. I got thirsty. How'd it go? You would not believe what happened here. Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35. Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.' Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.Jim and [under his breath] I work with a bunch of nerds. [to Sasha] Come on. [shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand. Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight. Do you have any computer games? Yeah, Meredith doesn't have any either. It's so lame here. Whatever, okay? That's your name? Mister Poop? Sure, Mister Poop. [Jake walks away] Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life. Dwight! Dwight! What the hell are you reading to them? What's a n*zi? Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't talk about n*zi in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it? [sighing] Why don't you just leave? Okay? You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business. That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to... I want to be on TV! Mister Poop, I have to tell you something. You're ugly. I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves]Michael and My theory is that... [Jim signals he's leaving, waves bye to Pam]Michael and [singing] ...The one they picked... the one you'll know by... don't you ever ask them why... if I told you would cry... you never look at them and sigh... and know they love you... One more time. [singing] You... [Dwight knocks on door] Yeah. Ohh, god. No no no, no, new suit, please. Thank you very much. It is from Italy. [checks jacket] Actually--- no, Bulgaria. Good luck. One of a kind. Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it. They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday. Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise. One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you? Where do we get those? Michael wants a strippergram? [eating donuts while Dwight plays the recorder] Stop it. Stop! What is that? Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything. If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week. What? [grinning] Ohhh, God. Ohhh, no. Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this. Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and... Okay. Thank you. Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please. It wasn't me. Uh, we don't make an eight foot sub. This is eight one foot subs. Uh, thirty-nine sixty. [pulls out wallet] Thirty nine... sixty. Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones. Get in here... everybody. What is this? And his favorite lunch. [making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing? [grabs cake] Oh. Thank you. What are--- it's... the party planning committee. Fine. Yes... [whispering] but don't expect any cookie. Are you done? ...Good. Okay. Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... [blows out the candles] ... I asked for trick candles. Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry. Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael. [sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by] Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey! Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight. You look cute today, Dwight. So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwightfindingdr*gs is more dangerous than most peopleusingdr*gs. [nods] Hey... And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said "Is it okay if I sip it?" and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way. Six. I go to a lot of parties. I am not giving you my keys. What's the hard way? Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow. Whoa. You are a volunteer. And that's not the same. [interrupting] Volunteer duty. [giggling] I wasn't attempting to compliment you. Uuf, well... [shakes head] Okay... I don't think Michael's ever done dr*gs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any. Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule. No, I have not. What are you implying? Okay. I'm done with this. He sure left in a hurry. I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime. Yes, it's marijuana. It's labeled. That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica. I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you. Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember. Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory? Now how do you know how it works? No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke? [presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face] I understand. Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble? Waa... what? What are you talking about? Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection. I can do that, it is my office. Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great. I'm not taking Rogaine. I don't take any prescription dr*gs. [Gives Dwight a knowing look] No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, "Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of dr*gs." The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate dr*gs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not. Yes, I will not be. Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you. We test a lot of urine. Oh, right. How are you? So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done. Just forget it. Just the urine. Just. I need your urine. Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight. It's none of your business. Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring. I need clean urine for the lady. A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens. Do you want to give Michael your urine? You're not going to get my permission on this. Yeah. Maybe. Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much. What's wrong? Where's your costume? Why? Wha... Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch. Yes, sir. Here's your badge. No, I don't have a g*n. Good. No. Oh. Uh...[awkwardly salutes] Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you. Two. Okay... [removes glasses] [leaving the room] Excuse me. Clown paint. Are you sure? [looks at Oscar, who is front of the camera, holding the baby poster in front of his chest] Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago. And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it. Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it. Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together. [to Dwight, who is sitting in front of the camera] Smile. No. This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go. Oh. What did I write? Talk to Michael. I gave him the box. Uh. Dwight. Okay! Calm down. Hey, hey! Stop. Okay... Dwight... Stop... Oh... kay... Okay. Yes. Mm-hmm. [picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security thr*at? You have till five. Maybe Stanford would be cool. Yeah. Maybe we should both go. Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later. Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work. Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week? Come on, everybody. Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two? It's a nice tux. Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert. I can always kind of win at roulette. Yeah. Mind control. Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind. It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things. Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene] Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration. That's a shawl. Well, actually, it's my warehouse. Why are you here? Oh, well... Kiss. [Michael kisses her on the cheek, pauses and then kisses her on the other cheek] That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight [Kisses cheeks] Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson. I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling. Um... Hey. What... Jan's here. Come on, Dwight. Good evening, Dwight. What is this? Then roll an eight. Good luck, Dwight. Let it ride. Let it all ride. The point is four. sh**t, roll it. Four! So close. So close. What? No, I... I didn't... I don't know... Three queens. No, that's a flush. Hey, wait. [train whistle blowing] Not it.[ The Accountants, Webisode 10 - "The Best Day of My Life" ] Well, we've asked everyone else. We asked her. She said she didn't do it. I believe she didn't do it. Are you doubting me? Oh, my God. How did he afford that new waterbed he's always bragging about? That's not true. Are you really gonna marry him? [Pam nods] ...Ok. Can you tell who's gay and who's not? What about Oscar? Well, heis. [deep sigh] There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else. Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman. I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you? Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them. That's ridiculous. [sighs] Let's call him and get the website. Well, they're sold out. Michael, Dwight's looking at gay p*rn on his computer. [looking at gay p*rn] Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay p*rn, straight p*rn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually... it is quite beautiful. That sounds great. No one else in this office is gay. [sobbing] I'm sorry I called you f@ggie. You're not f@ggie. You're a a good guy. I was going to quit. But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gill and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay. [Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body] What are you doing?! Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo. But I don't understand. It's for managers. I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there? Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker. Um. Okay, um. You got that? Write it down. I got it. Andrea's the office b*tch. You'll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed. Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too! Hey! No, it's not. I did. Yep. If I weren't engaged, I would so h*t that. Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much. Oh, hey! And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time. I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic. That is crooked on that side. All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up. Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin. All right. So maybe. See ya. Because he's afraid to fly. Yep. Yeah, she's up front. I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello? I need you to do something for me. I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic. Okay. And? Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip. You're welcome. Michael. Okay! Excellent. Oh... Shut it. [answering phone] Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. [to others] Say hi to Pam!Jim, Josh, and You first. Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products. Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael's black light on] Ha, ha, ha. Whoa. What are those stains? Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Yes! [walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello? Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs. You know she has it out for him now. That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart! Dwight, you should be running this office. It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her. [laughing] Yeah. [answering the phone] Hello? Who is this? You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other. What about him? It's not about a surprise party is it? Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back. How do you know I like that store? How do you know that? No it's not. It's officially not. ...noted. Ok. Ouchy. Three hours, wow. Have fun. [Dwight walks away staring through the blinds at Michael] Yeah. New blouse? Halter top? Camisole? Teddy? Really? Ok. What would you do differently? Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers. The decision to turn on Michael was difficult. [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So [cutting his food, giving Jan a "so there" look], here we are. It's all, on the table. I want... the branch. And I await your decision. Hey Dwight. Do you want an M&M? No seriously. You should have an M&M, they're really good. They're good, huh? Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in. Sounds like a good dentist. What's his name? Your dentist's name is Crentist. Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist. Let me see your teeth. Let me see 'em. Let me see 'em. You should... floss. [in Michael's office] Wow, this is tough. Ohhhh. Arrrgggh! Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um... she demoted me. Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job! And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally. Yep, I did. I did. But I think... you should do it. [exhales] Perfect, well, we're settled. All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager. Ohh.. Well... I guess we should go tell the troops. Congratulations Dwight. Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty? It's really happening! We can make a difference here. You alone? Because I thought together we could--- Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring. It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it. What? But you said you liked it. You've always admired it. [Michael finally breaks] Take it back. That's my car. THAT'S MY CAR. I know, Dwight. I know. I know. I know. Jan called me about your little meeting! I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight. Oh do you? Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?! How dare you, Dwight? Give me one good reason why I should f*re you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?! Not. Good. Enough! I have a laundry machine! I don't know if I can trust you anymore. All right, I'll be right back. [goes down pretend stairs] [hands Ryan pencil] There you go. You're welcome. Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute. [goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from Stanley's desk] What? Oh my God. You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated. [clears throat] So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this... What are you doing? I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out. Hi. I do not wanna talk about this. We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move... I think that is a great way to honor Ed. Life-size. DEAD. Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a sh*t? Was its heart b*ating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying] [seeing bird] Oh, God! Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ... Oh shhhh--oot! No, he's not. No, he's not. [cradling bird next to face] Ugh, no that thing isdead. I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight? What are... What are you doing? No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!? I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute. Is it for the bird? I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box] If you wanna do something for the funeral... Maybe you could play a song on your recorder. Do you have it with you? And we know how he d*ed. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song. [quickly] Amen. Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown. A dime and a nickel. But the other one is. I've heard that before. Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother. He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted. It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole. It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five. Yeah. Yes. I'm very excited. I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited. So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office? Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too. I know where we're not. [looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh... Come on. I don't think you know what you're saying. Uh huh. Gotcha. Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor. I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship. Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back. Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it. Yeah. All right! Thank you! Who was that? Is that your Cousin Mose? Yes. Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore. Outsourcing and consolidation of competition. Depression? You're a freak! Um, loneliness. Maybe women. No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over. OK. No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye. Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice. Where are all the animals? Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled. Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call. Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal? Wait, can you go back? Ok, I'm going to establish time frames. I'm going to put everything in terms of "real dollars". I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers. Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing. They really didn't like me. I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan. I just feel kind of tired, you know. Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right? She looks like Pam from the neck down. Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... ' Okay. Spoiler... alert. I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean? I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] "Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight." Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast. Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please. Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can. All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at Dwight] Let's go. Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup. Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch. No... way. No. There's no one else. Still. Okay, okay. Um... Why? You sent him cards? You never met him. Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that. I will improvise. I will speak from the heart. All right. Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace? Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work? Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings. [no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that. Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay? Don't touch me this time. Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? No. Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few. The office. Anything? What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under? [pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go. That was hilarious. The foam ... Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good. Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one. God, Dwight! What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car. Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore! What?! We did it? We did it. We did it!Michael and Right here! Right here! [pounds his chest against Dwight's]Michael and Yeah, baby! We did it! How did we do it? That's great! Because he accomplished something. About seven. Well, that has wheels. Really, Dwight? How fast are you? Really? I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther. Oh, I'll just time him later. Yeah. Are you ready? Go! Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to b*at Toby. Here... Who's here? Yes, please. Karen Filip... [In Italian voice] Ka-ren Fili-pell-li. Who's next? Andy Bernard. Saint Bernard. What? I'm not... I'm not f*ring somebody on the first day. No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner. Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr. Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand. Hey, Dwight. Okay. Sounds good. I don't know what you're talking about. No. Looks good. I'm not. I am. Right. Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales. Umm, on the contrary. And I'm a director. Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film? [talking to himself] I present the orientation video. Not now. I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale. It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one. I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok? Work it out amongst your selves! Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company? Will you? Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'. So check out how we liveMichael & They call it Scranton. The Electric City. Scranton. The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider. You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot, But the little cars go in the compact spotMichael and Hey, buddy. Anything new to report? I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just. [laughs hysterically] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor. Okay! Okay! Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this! Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up. Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay. Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you. Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight. Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires. Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators. So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two. Yeah, it does, actually. Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks. Shut it... Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon? Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese. Actually, it is. It's Latin for "earth." Yeah. Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back. Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came. Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University. If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm. [coughs word] Idiot! [coughs sentence] Nice comeback! Just... try to be cool. Okay, are you cool, really? Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. [Dwight starts to run] No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool! Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. t*nk. Merry Christ--[looks up] NO! Why... why did you bring that here? Dwight, what uh... Well, get it out of here. Merry Christmas Dwight. Wow. What have we got here? Dead goose. All right. Oh, Dwight, we talked about this. No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead. Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it k*lled. Wow. Win-Win. Dwight, you cannot keep that here. Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour. It's a dead animal in an office. You can't... I'm sorry. I would like it off my desk. If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her. That's not fair. I don't need to know. Take it from Toby. What are you doing? ["Goodbye My Lover" by James Blunt plays] Carol? Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to "Goodbye My Lover" on computer] I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it. I think that's a really good option... You can't do that. Umm... I'm number three. Yeah, but I'm number three. OK, I think I can help here. As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now. Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.] Permission denied. So she looks really hot, so I said, "You look hotter than usual today." [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table. Yes. Carol used to drink lattes. She would get this little foam mustache... And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, that's not funny. She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy --- Michael! Repeat what you said louder! No. Oh, yeah... Maybe. No, it's Usuba. Actually, the Usuba's the better Kn*fe when you're working with this quantity. [on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party? Did Michael give you permission to do this? This is great. Oh, [points to Cindy] she's asleep. I... don't know, it has four bed rooms and a loft... And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it. Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party. Did you have fun at Benihana's? [Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift] Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices] Do you like it? Can I talk to you a second? [singing] Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya... Merry Christmas. [singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum. Ohh... [laughs] All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this? For what? Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing? You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office. Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a Kn*fe! No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic Kn*fe to Stanley's neck?! [picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet. Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly... Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies. I have a special assignment for you. A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess." Not important. OK, forget it. She bought it? [Pam nods] OK. OK. [to Jim and Ryan] Michael h*t a deer? There an accident? Somebody hurt? Definitely. There are copies in the bathroom? Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life. What? No, it's not... it's nothing. Yeah. [Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here. Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam's desk] So that just leaves Dwight and Jim. Dwight? Here ya go. [throws laundry] It's just... brrrrrr... It's "Amazing Race," Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it. Seriously? You're going to sit in the back? Mind? Nothing would delight me more. You still do that thing? After you sir. Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will att*ck you from the front. 'Kay. 'Kay. Yeah, sure, go ahead. Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked. We have discount prices on ink cartridges... And, also, any forms that you are going to need... We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys. Please keep holding, your call is very important to us. Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up] Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three. Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence. We should go on a double date. Big deal. Where were you this morning? Why do you lie, liar? It sure seems like he is lying. I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing. Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard. Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day. How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business. I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world. 'Kay. Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome. Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy? No, he was not. He was a total douche. Doompity-doomp. Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had. I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting. professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia. I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me. How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable. There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon. You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work. Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one. Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking. Really comin' down out there. Commute's gonna be hell. So um, where were you workin' before this? What kind of company is that? I never heard of 'em. Sure? Okay. Hey. What's up? Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did. Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize. How's this place treating you? Oh, well. No. I'm sure. So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please. Welcome back. Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. [looks around the room] Not bad, huh? And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? [hands broom to Dwight, though Oscar thinks he's handing it to him] Hello son. If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead. Life is a road--- To jump start a car, first pop the hood. Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine. Then you take these and clip them wherever. [Dwight is wearing a bra] You just twist your hand until something breaks. And remember no matter what, I will always love you. He's not going to be a m*rder. You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no? Okay. From the top. Ready? Three- Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh! [Spanks himself] Gay. Absolutely not. Well get on it. And make it happen. Stop. That's disgusting. Fine. Sally. Blonde. Have you ever seen a stripper before? I'm Elizabeth, I'm the dancer that was requested. I'm the stripper. [Phone rings] Oh God. Guys, beef! It's what's for dinner! Who wants some man meat? Yeah she probably, yeah she would be. You know what, okay, excuse me. Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music. This is wrong, this is wrong! This is wrong! I have a girlfriend. And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay. Shame on you. Go back to work! You want me to answer phones with my clothes on. Wow. Thank you. Chocolate! Where did you acquire it? That is a delicacy in the Amazon but it has not yet been imported to the United States. Joseph the 2nd. Fredrick Wilhelm the 3rd. Why the tyrant King George, of course! So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep? Ben Franklin. And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice. Which rhymed. Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't. Both. That's why I invented the bifocal. Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid? [Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid? [Windows reboot sound] Altoid? [Windows reboot sound] Mint Dwight? Inbwit? Yes. What are you doing? What? Unbelievable. Hi, Dwight. Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left! Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'. You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers. Did you ever see that movie? Of course I saw it. You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out. [whispers to father] That's ok. [Albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking] Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. [to Albert] Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too. I don't have that, Dwight. Who? Oh, I... I don't... I'm not sure. Okay, Okay. Where are we going? Come... Come on! Dwight, just... Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song. Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you? "Don't be an idiot." Changed my life. ....Dude. Dwight, what are you doing? Oh my God! I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it. Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six. I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd... Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel. What? ... No. It b*rned me. I... bizarre. No... no. One crisis at a time. The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding. I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I sh*t one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog. Sure. Okay. Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family! So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control? Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight. Goodbye Jim. And good luck. How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh? Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh! Can you confirm that the straps are tight? MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don't see how he can. Alright. Another worm? Like, are they friends? No, no. Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless? Is anybody else in the... Ok. Beauty. Thank you sir! Thank you. Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me. I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that. Yes. Oh, um, potato salad. No thank you, Roy. Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please. No. Thank you. About 5,000. Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate. David, how much did this house cost? I'll show you around. I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station. Uh, that's a guest room. [phone rings] Oh. I must get that. You'll have to excuse me. Uh, yes. [takes duck back] Yes. I don't know, it was here when I was born. I don't know. I don't know. Where to begin? My ball. Ok. [screams in pain] Ahh God! Pam, please call security! Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy. Thank you. Okay. Um... Got you something. You don't know what it is. It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead. That would have made us even, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even Steven. Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna... Which is where? Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something. Boy I--- I know. What's what? Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice... honor. Dwight. Dwight. I've been doing some very interesting reading. Mm-hmm. Tales of bravery. Mm-hmm. I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together. Hey guys! Guess who's back! [Dwight pepper-spray's Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD! No need to thank me. Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight. How's it goin' man? Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna. Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug. You guys... [half-heartedly] Andy! Nah, that's too far. The baler can flatten a car engine. It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a b*at. They use props. They use visual A*DS, and they just made us look like dopes. I don't know, I don't know. Because you know what our k*ller is? Depression--- Nn--- Depression. Yes. Ryan, well done. Two minutes, forty-two seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said "awesome" 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies. Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or... Go buy some watermelons. I don't know this place as well as I thought I did. I'm getting cleaned out. Let's do it! Drop that sucker. BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh... crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess. Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes. Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler. Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster. I'm on it! Thank you. Anything. You mean a moon bounce. I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash. Do you, do you want a drawbridge? Un-shun. Yeah that sounds good. Re-shun. Yes, thank you for seeing that. I don't know if I wanna do this. No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking. Rock n' roll! That's right! I am not thinking. Yes! Yeah! Woo! Woo! I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point! [Dwight continues air guitar] Whoa! What's the situation? Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end? Is it nice outside? Do I need my jacket? Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T? Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go! Let's go! [on the roof] My life! Oh, my life... Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression. Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit su1c1de every year! According to a 2004 study! Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil! Wait, where are the warehouse guys? Okay... that's... That's the whole point, dummy. Okay. If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it. If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be averyrich dude. Oooooh, my life! Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed. Oh my God, thereisa castle. Dwight, find out what the present is. Dwight, what are you--- [Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question. What kind of bear is best? False. Black bear. Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica. Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Uh, four dollars. And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble. And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars. ... MICHAEL! Everybody in here. STAT. No time to lose. Cri-Man-Squa. F and C, doubletime. No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference. No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves. OK, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice. On it. OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair. Put the most attractive beets on top. The ones that make you pull the car over and go, "Wow, I need this beet right now." Those are the money beets. Hi, uh--- Scranton Times. Chad Lite, "Lighter Side of Life." And obits. Oh... Uh, yeah, I'd like uh, uh--- When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment. And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first. I don't care! It was disgusting. Cartoon characters having sex? OK... Mm-hmm. "Hello. I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that." That's how devoted I am to this job. I know. I understand that, Dwight. Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut? Sweet. Hey, Dwight. You look really nice today. Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp. [Dwight imitates the "Jim face"] Look at that. Spot on. [Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this? [reads demerit] "Jim Halpert, tardiness." Ugh. I love it already. Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean? Lay it on me. Now that sounds serious. Which would be me. OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation. Oh, my God. [on speakerphone] You got it, Jan. [exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house. OK. This is the lastthingthat Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight. Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say. [raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces? Phallus? Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] "Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute." This is ridiculous. Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting. See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight? Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one? That is not current. Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls. OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie. I have to know whether you're serious or not. I wish I could menstruate. OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go! Yeah. Uh, Phyllis got a good look. Hmm. I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today. This guy looks like a real deviant. Aye, aye, Cap'n. Many womenarecompetent drivers. [scraping] OK. Come on. Think we'll find him? [pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies? Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot. Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera. [sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. "Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?" You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all. Hey, Dwight. It's Jim. No, you're not. I'm looking right at you. Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator. I saw him two minutes ago. In the women's bathroom, above the sink. Ughh... Blech. Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying... Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.] Maybe. About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned. Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner! Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off. Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley. not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something. I'm not playing. We are going to choose team names. Dwight? Really? Not Slytherin? I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort. [starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left. Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore. You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race. That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team. [off screen] Pam...you're missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook] Turkey is a healthy meat. The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright? 13 hot dogs, everybody! [holding a fish with all the meat stripped off] Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs! What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich? I knew you were saying sabotage. I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane. If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see. One. Two. Three. Excellent! I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words. Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad. Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle] One, two, three, go! Don't, don't. Wow. Go, Dwight. Keep moving. I'm not going to give it to you. Michael, do something! Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us. [breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh... [knock on door] Yeah. Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute. Okay. Uh... Uh, okay. Stop crying. I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time. No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome. [smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor. Oh hey, Dwight. Does my room have cable? Can I change rooms? Can I have a late checkout? You're not the manager even in your own fantasy? Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil? Go. Eighty thousand dollars a year. [signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view. No. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you this, it isnotbecause of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is... emotionally magnificent. All right, you guys. See you later, wish us luck! Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck] I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche... Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care. Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye. White, because it contains all other colors. You make a chair, but you don't sit on it. The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell. Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended. my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous. Damn it! Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck. I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy... is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep. Hail to the chief! accept. Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the "motorboat" noise] "Brbrbrbrbr!" also? Thank you. Really? You will be your own assistant. Okay. So... you would be the Regional Manager,andthe Assistant Regional Manager. Andy is your number two. I would be the Secret Assistant Regional Manager. Mm-hmm. [laughs] Mm. Yeah. [raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck? So tenthousandof your dollars is worth one real dollar? Amen. [raises hand] Do we have to? No, we're letting Jan go. [at the same time as Dwight] Trees. [at the same time as Dwight] Forest. Liquid. I don't want it. Make it 100. No. In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again. The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns. That's it! Class is canceled, everybody out! I'm punishing them. What--- What are you winking for? It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall. This is gonna look so awesome! Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. "Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoe in." Well, got down there. I nailed the interview. And the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black? That's stupid. [to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin' on that coffee. Dwight, hello.
