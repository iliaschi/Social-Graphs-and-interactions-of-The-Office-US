It's the world's only international sport! [sits down] No this is Holly. No this is Holly. Busted. So what can I do for you Holly. Oh really? Was anyone k*lled? Any nuns? [still on phone with Holly] Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn't been transferred? We would have twins. [Dwight points towards the corner of his lip, indicating Michael's "herpes"] Mmhmm! Mhhmm! We would be married. Do what? I don't romanticize th- [Dwight nodding and mouthing 'Yes you do'] No... He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation. We were more than we were. Ok, alright I gotta go. I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right? Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] "How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight." Hello. Hello. [imitating her accent] Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard. [as Curly] Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh? Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! [as Homer] D'oh! Hi. Hi. Oh... [they hug] Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! [both sigh] Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly. Did you bring us anything from Nashua? That's adorable. To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone? Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party. Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. [in a stereotyped Mexican accent] I show you to your desk. Aww... This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it? Oh... Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! [the both chuckle] Oh, I love toy... Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character? You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom. Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie. You're kidding me. Ahh! What a douche bag! Get a... yeah! Good riddance. Mmhmm. Good for him. Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house? Oh, you do? [fighting back tears] Yeah, Randy Newman's the best. So is it an open relationship? Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids? I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it! Wow, an ultimatum. Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy. With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing. I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab." Yeah... Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh? All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings. No, fake girlfriends are always wrong. When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I can't do this." But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me. [blocks Holly's path] No. Was I supposed to bring you guys something? Surprise. I wanted to see you. How are you? Oh, God, you look great. Is everyone here kind of mean? Oh. Hey, what happened to Woody? He smells awful. [whispering] Come on! Oh my God! That's it! That's it! Yes, I told everyone. Hello! Oh, somebody's got a new phone! That is neat. [imitating E.T.] E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone? [imitating E.T.] Why? [imitating E.T.] Bummer. [imitating E.T.] Reese's Pieces. I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible. [slams phone on desk, phone breaks] Want some company? I went to Portugal. So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ? You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present? [imitating E.T.] Holly Flax. [imitating E.T.] Not Michael, E.T. Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there. My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully. We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine... You know what might be kind of fun? I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and... [as Mikanos] If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos? Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today. Well... [as Mikanos] Practice Olympics. [as Mikanos] I like the musical "Grease", or as we call it, "home". It... [laughs] I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk! No more brain damage! Ahh! Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my b*lls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em. [as Mikanos] Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on. Just a minute. How long do we have to wait? You broke up with AJ weeks ago. I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now? Sure we do. Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody. Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree. Yes I do. Yes I do. Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good. [to cameras] Nope, get away. No, that's enough. Ok. Yeah. You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go? Yeah, he just left. Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way. No word from Michael. Hey! What are you doing? Sure thing. Here you go, Miss... Okay, Fanny Smellmore. Real original. Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly? You knew. Where did he go, Holly? Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, "this way, this way"? Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you! Not you, Erin. That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next. Right. I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination. Maybe he's bowling. Hi. [laughs] How did you know I was up here? I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin. Yeah. [laughs] Wow. I just miss you so much. Really? Can I kiss you? Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene. Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me. Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye. Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly's back] Oh, yeah. A little lower. Maybe you find your own chair. Right. Okay. Ah, the old "leave behind." Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working. Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt. Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop. Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day. I love you. I love you-love you. I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly's hand] Hello, Holly. Here, shake. No! No, we can't. No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you. Oh. Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh. Grab you here. You have to cut it out. Never. You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling. Yes, it was that. It's that one. Yes. Number three. We're not supposed to PDA. I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua. That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different? I was in love with you. Holly. Hey. Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up. Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow. You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's... Who? Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu. What are our plans for tonight? Umm... Thanks mom. Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom. It's got a lot of me. [to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that? Hey. Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great! Did you? What did you love about it? No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly. Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded. [angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream. I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus. Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing. I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie. Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you. Hey... It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly. Hi. [Holly and Michael kiss] [shaking Holly's hand] Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston! Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five sh*ts. And it also helps if you've had five sh*ts. [peering into conference room] Don't know, don't care. [seething] Holly, you approved this? You did approve it? [in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this? [walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um... Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer? He's seriously awful! United front... [seems unsure] Everything... Everything. Well, I mean he humped Michael. [giggling] Mean but good! I don't know, I love her and all, but she turned into a b*tch. Mostly she's great, but some days she acts like her mom. [Holly is un-amused] Best day ever. Best day ever! Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head? Please. Yeah, You love him right? [Holly seems unsure] You love him. I can tell. No. Not me, him. [looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself. Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey... He's funnier than me. [very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other! [seems taken aback] Uhm... That's insane! That is. [Jim sees them and looks happy] It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there. Nah, he's an ass. [imitating] You ahh. No you ahh. I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless. 500. That is how you do it. You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price. In case... in case of what? I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case? Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try. Your friend Michael, yes. What's going on? Holly? There was a program on TV about India. Wanna watch it? What are you doing there? I'll, I'll put your mother on. Holly? Don't you worry about him, he's got me. I have your father. He's right here I'll put him on. My mom also makes the best salsa. Yeah mostly. It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was. Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested. Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.' Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything. Oh ok. For how long? Is he alright? You ok? Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that. Ok. No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope. Hey, how'd we do? That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good. No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that. So this is one of my favorite places in the world. This is where we first kissed. And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there? Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes. Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness? We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump. And over here.. Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [runs water through hand] Let's go in here. Holly, will you marry me? Marry me Holly. Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Will you marry me Holly? [the area where Holly's desk is is filled with lit candles] This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. [f*re sprinklers go on] Holly Flax, marrying me will you be? [crying] I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. [picks World's Best Boss mug out of the trashcan and puts it back on his desk] I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come. [dials on his phone] Hi. What is the name of our town? No, no. I just needed to hear your voice. [laughing] Yes. [Olive Oyl impression] Yes my hero! [laughing] Ohh, I miss you. Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you. Hi, can I help you? So this is H.R. This is your desk. Michael Scott, this is Holly. I'm gonna win. Yeah. T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness. [shaking Holly's hand] The pleasure's all mine. Any time. [whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin? He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain. Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos] Hi. I do the numbers. Do you want a M&M? Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them. Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram? I bet. I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off? Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in? You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player? All right. Yep. I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap! Hi. I can't decide what to get. Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips. [on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply] Hello, Holly. [Holly is on the floor with her desk chair in pieces] Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually. And the sequel, "Woman Stands at Desk and Works." So, I have no idea how you, [he sits on the floor] how you sit like that. [as Yoda] Sit on floor and put together chair we will. [laughs nervously] Yo-da. Um... So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town. Kidding. [overdramatically] Acting! [overdramatically] Acting! Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend. Hey! Hi, good to see you. I'm just having a little exit interview. Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler? Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right? Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see. No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud. How did you know? [clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up] I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- [Holly knocks on Michael's door] [voice straining] I'm just worried about my friend. Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run. I'm cool. Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he? That's what she... a lot of places are like that. I like, uh... I'm really sorry. Yeah... Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay. Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car? Okay, bye. [singing, screaming into the mic] Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by! Oh, hey. Thanks. Just hurry. [hangs up] Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me. I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight... Hey. Yeah? Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar. [they chuckle] Oh... Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there. I'll go to the diner with you. Yeah, we can go eat pie. Me too. Have a good night. Bye. I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked. Pam, you weigh 226 pounds? Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200... I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my f*re. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted. Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City. Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch. I'm gay! What's the joke? Oh, you think it's a choice? I'm messing with you, Holly. Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go. [rapping] I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat! Please sit down. When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father. That's his ex. Yes, she is. And clinically insane. Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it. Hey! Thank you, Holly. Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded? Oh, Holly, that is very offensive. Good. No. They should not be in that room. Let's go mini-golfing. Uh... You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early? Yeah. Happy Birthday, Stanley! [kicks cake onto Michael] Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon! Who is slacking? So how was your date? [groans painfully] [exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan] Mmm-hmm. Saunas. [into phone] Phyllis Vance for David Wallace. [in a fat suit, speaking in his Michael Clump voice] Ohhhh! Bang! Boom! Say Clump! Why hello everybody! How was Friday night? Yeah, oh, hey. Did he call? No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy. What, what happened? Did he call? Really? Aach. I dunno. I always call everybody back right away. He'll call back though. Give him until the end of the day, he'll call. If he doesn't, he is loco. Ugh. Wait, do we have until the end of the day? God. Where is Jim? Aww, really? I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing... ...was that he was a complete stupid idiot. I know. I love Counting Crows. Wow, really? That's a shame. A shame to waste these. I want to buy them from you. I do. No. I do. I, I want to. Trust me. I really do. Ok? Alright. Alright! [tears up tickets] Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok? Case closed. Umm, can I pay you tomorrow? I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so... Is that good? Sorry. Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time. [trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John's "Let's Get Physical" starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing]Michael & Ok, let's give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax! [everyone claps] [clapping] Ok. Well done. Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy. I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree. Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. [claps] What? I'll smoke with you. I got a bag of cigars in my purse. Do some... do some work. [whispering to Holly] People expect a lot from these meetings. Laughter, sudden twists. Surprise endings. You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan. You need to be Robin Shyamalan. Do you... just... you're kind of losing them. Yeah, don't think about the stakes. It'll freak you out. [coughs to hide his words] Lauren, [coughs] enough with the pencils. I would not... steal the bread. And I would not let my family go hungry. I will go first. When I discovered YouTube I didn't work for five days. I did nothing. I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times. To tell you or not. And I'm glad I did. I feel very very good. Cathartic. I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble. You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity. Who hasn't? Good. Good! What else? Ach! Wuh--- That's crazy. That's crazy talk! Meredith! The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers! Hoo-ooh! Wow! What time we got? [checks watch] You know what? That's a good place to end it. Right there. This, I think, was a great ethics seminar. She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about. Right... what is wrong. Who's to say? Really. In the end. I mean because it is... unknowable. But, let's give her a round of applause. Holly, everybody. Holly! Get back to work. [everyone applauds, then leaves] [to Holly] Great job. I am truly impressed. That, uh, you really pulled that one out. Classic. Classic meeting. We should celebrate. Oh... Nnyeah. What ya gonna do? No... no, this is just a stupid formality. Ughh! For the love of God we're trying to help you... stupid bag. Well it's funny. Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here? I thought I had immunity? Well, well. Holly... lujah! It's a miracle, you're at your desk. Hoo-ooh! Reaching! You'll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out. Good. Would you care to bang it out over lunch? Oh no, no, no. Your food is no good here, my lady. [sweeps her food into the trash can, misses] Sorry! You know what? Let's go out! Dunder Mifflin's treat. Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it? Ethical. What do you think? What do you think of this place? Istn't it? Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic. So you're from Des Moines? Wow, that sounds so... warm. Here too. You know what my favorite season is? Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons. Wow, terminator, terminator. I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance. I mean, what sort of place is that to call home? And Meredith needs this job. This is her main source of money. Ok, new idea. We don't report it at all. We just punish her. Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months. I don't know. I saw this thing, like a belt with a key. I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying. Yes. Well... bleh busted. I don't... Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family. Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera] You get me. [on speakerphone] Listen, Holly, Michael, I just got the report that your branch submitted and there's a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having with.. Well, I'm not sure these circumstances warrant any action. Well, from what I can gather it seems like a gray area. Look, to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I don't know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that. I thought it was clear with you, Holly. Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training. Every other branch has managed to get this to us so if it's not something you can handle then that's a different discussion. How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, "I told you so." Gently with a rose? In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke? Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way. It's a trap. Now is really not the time, Meredith. Ahoy, matey. Ahoy. So, how you doin'? Um, listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest. It's all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I'm treating Ryan the same way. OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop. [wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep. Where's Astrid? On a what? [sarcastically] That's funny. OK. [just hugs her, and she hugs him back and smiles] You wanna go out? Hey. That was really fun last night. I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs. Yeah? Oh really? Well... I, uh... [to camera] I let her win. So, when, um, can I see you again? No. Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good. [Holly's smile quickly fades] Because I am busy taking you out. [concerned] Why? Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight... Tonight's so... Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day. I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know. Yeah. Some of what we order depends on whether we're having sex after. [laughs] Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have sex tonight? Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first. No, it's lettuce. 00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes. [sighs] [goofy voice] I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy. You're crazy, go crazy. Do you need 'em? All right. Thank vous. [chuckling] What? Oh! [kissing] Not if we turn these dials [getting louder] all the way down. [whispering] Now they can't hear us at all. Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have. Yeah. Oh... oh! No, did you? Oh, no, my God. Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight... Do I? Yeah, I think that's pretty boss. Whoa! Twice. ... Right? Mm-hmm. [whispering] Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It's sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them- [Holly covers Michaels mouth] Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. b*rned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets. When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire. Road trip! Right? We're not. We're not doing anything. Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug] We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.Michael and This trip was longer than I thought. Ah! Ah! Ahhhh! [waking up] Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare. Four hours. Almost halfway there. Next exit isn't for five miles. Here we go, fourth time's a charm. "Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there.... [Holly sobs] Hey. Are you crying? Allergies? WHAT!? What's the matter? Sure it is. Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine. Listen to me. I like you so much. And I've dated four women in the last-- Not last - no. In like the last ten years. I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid. Yeah, good. Can we--- [Dwight pulls out Cornell mascot bobble-head] Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!! Yeah. Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way. I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road. Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend? Years! Yeah. Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy. You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well. We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think? Please? Please... So um... I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl [Holly hugs Michael] Okay. [they kiss goodbye.] Goodbye. We're just friends. [approaches Holly and AJ] Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know. Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right. All right. Mmhmm. [both start laughing and hug] Hey. Hey. [hugs AJ a little too forcefully] Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless. What is up with you two, Holly? Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported. All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse. Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin. That's right. I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry. [watching her eat] What? Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool? We could do a movie... sort of thing. Oh! Could we get a Delorean? Oh! [to the theme of "Jaws"] Dun-der. Dun-der... Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! [both laugh] No. No. We're circling it. [imitates Who Wants To Be a Millionaire theme music as both sit in folding chairs] Yes, I am. Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College. [screams] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!! Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in. I'm Robert Mifflin. [pause to see audience's response] Ah, okay. [both run back to chairs] Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a g*n. He sh*t himself in the head. I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful. I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer! [over crowd of murmurs] What is he talking about? Are we losing our jobs or not, David? Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo. Should've had hindsight. I think it went well. I think it was good. No, it was a tough audience. Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them. Me too. [long pause] We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch. Oh good, because my next question was "do you have a game to get back to." Well you guys should h*t the road before... I close down another branch.
