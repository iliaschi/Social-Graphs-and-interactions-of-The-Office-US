I am gay, and I prefer men. You did not, Kenny! Go away. Get out! You ruined my party! Who does that? Are you kidding me? [Andy and Erin run to the car] Yeah, run away! I can't believe you're not gay! [Andy and Erin kiss] Yeah, you never know. Hey, how's Annie? Hey, Kenny. You said it was important, so... How's it going? Yeah? Get you a drink. One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here. [points at one of Stanley's hands and one of Pam's] Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley's hand]. Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God! Are they going to call the cops? Jet ski money?
