Here you go, Big O. Tiny. [hands Kevin his coffee] Darryl Hannah. Ooh, yeah. Must've been some sort of mix-up there. You could just drink it, or I could drive all the way back? He messed yours up to. No, it... Yes, okay, right. [erases don't] All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go. [writes "Don't" in front of symbol] Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing. I can't see. Wait, I see you every day. Can I say "Good month?" Heh. We can do that. [trying to stuff balloons below the seats] This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people from bringing in balloons. No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber. Are you kidding me? Darryl? Didn't know you were gonna be here. How's the toilet? Thank you. Thank you. Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling. That would never happen. Okay. I appreciate the feedback. I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity. Good! Who can tell me what the safest form of sex is? Incorrect, the only true form of safe sex, ok? Abstinence. No. No I'm just sweating. I'm not crying I'm just sweating. Ok. Yeah. [knocking] Knockity-knock, don't knock back. Just kidding you can knock; it's your office. Do you have a minute? Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that you're entering points into Weight Watchers dot com. I'm starting a band and I need you on keyboards. This is for pleasure. I'm willing to pay you. Yeah. Sixty bucks a session. [in falsetto] Please Mr. President- Yeah. Yeah, but I'm using my falsetto. Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul. Good-bye! Yeah. Reverse snobbery. Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by. Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that's amazing! [singing] Which me am I gonna be today? Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour? Wait. Seriously? So we're just, like, jamming as friends? Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love. Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love and I gave her the croak that meant I love you. Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog. Ribbit! Blackula! Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had. Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man. Really? We're good? Okay. [reaches out and shakes Darryl's hand] Okay. Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone? Hi, Darryl, come out here, please. You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar! Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed. Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other. You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a b*ating. Okay, that might help. If you said "I'm sorry" in front of everybody. In front of me. So that's it. Is it? Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it. Thank you. If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no! That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you? Oh... Well... You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide. Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call. What's up, man? When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day. Bernard's Regards. I started to ask myself, "Do I have big plans here?" I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group? Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School. Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together. It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life. My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight. Hey Darryl. But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane. Got it. Then I will call you. No. Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time. Well are you? Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican. Megan Fox! Come on! Yes, but one good text away from a high five. They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion. Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away. [two pigeons are eating out of a soft serve cone] Yeah. Right. Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating? I'll take one of those pink pouches. Cool. [on the phone] I'm not doing it! She told me she wants to have Christmas here. Yes. She wants to be around family for Christmas. I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter. Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck. Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back. Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone. Maybe. I mean... I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to k*ll myself. Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents. No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas. Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome. He doesn't look like Santa Claus. Daddy, I'm bored. Can I read my book in your office? I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges. Do you know the other state? The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! [pulls star from coat and pretends to find it behind Jada's ear] I am dead inside. Great. Hey. Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much. Awesome. It's that easy? Okay, I'll drive. I'll take the entirety of the second floor. Well, if you read a lot, you should check out our e-readers. They're really neat. Actually, it's ten thousand. Is that what we were doing? Good. Real good. Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll. Okay. What'd you get? Oh, really? What else? Let me see. It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine. I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution. Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time. Hey, there's a roller rink across the street! There's always chicks at the rink. Roller derby practice! [throws resolution board away in dumpster] Lesson learned. Hey! Where did you go? Oh, cool. Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him. Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club. Really? [turning towards Darryl] Hey, do you need a lozenge? What? You suppose? You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging. You? Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed. I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other. Oh! Ok. Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive. "Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island.' Hey. How you doing? Yeah. At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you. It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday. I'm so sorry. ...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work. Oh, yeah! ...but it's totally inappropriate. Mm-hmm. Whispering and tickling have their place in business. Don't mind us. You keep working. No, I'm just testing if he can hear. What do you... Pi... Okay. [through the window at Michael] Hey, buck up, buddy! Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven. Well... there's no instructions. I'm pretty good at board games. Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being. Oooh. no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life. Well played. Well that's Dallas. Yeah I told you, you can't sh**t people. This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money? And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time! So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle! It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions. It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good. Oh, yeah. Put a pin on that, kid. Can't wait to hear the punchline. I still have to look at this stuff, guys. [holds out cowboy boots for Darryl] Hey, hey, hey! [holds up set of p*stol in holsters] Jim, please no loopholes. [escorts Erin off stage] There you go. I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything. [walking into Darryl's office] Darryl! I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage. [hands him a thin black folder] Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you. Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer. Darryl. Per your request, the company is sending you to business school at night. Full ride. Deal with it. It blows away Vermont in the fall. [looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled "administrative" and "assistant." Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was -- Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or -- Whoa. Daaamn! Mad respect for my brotha! Okay. We'll keep that in mind. Alright, ladies, back to the game. No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever. Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support] It's my ear. Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room. Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight... [in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning. [also to Darryl] Good morning. Did you have a nice drive in? I did. [Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl. [pats Andy on the back] Thank you. [Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh. Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking? So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office? Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight? I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl] [ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right? Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away] [alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!! I do really want him. Great. I'm sure it's fine. Howard Cline? [checks sheet] Oh... Deshaun Williams. He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser... Ohh, Robin was good. She's always good. Keeps him on his toes. Its Howard's show though. [picks up resume from Jim's desk] Whose is this? Darryl Philbin. Ohh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top. Ah... a little long aren't we? Four pages? Is this the same Darryl Philbin who's had two jobs in ten years at one company? Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5 billion units of what? Paper material? Exactly. Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager? I don't know if he'd be a good manager [Jim shakes his head and looks wide-eyed at Darryl], but he's a really great dad! This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend. Hoist him aloft. C'mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk] I'm lifting. Completely. It was excellent. Andy wants us to, P-Dog. Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?[Group murmurs, offended] Well I'm just quoting you. I would never say that about her. I don't know the woman. Wow. Alright. Can't wait to meet her. I'll introduce you. So...DARRYL! A GIRL! Can we.... go some place private? Oscar, it's not that hot out. Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick. The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus. [sh*t shows warehouse crew going wild in the office] This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things. [On phone] Hello?....Justine! [laughs] Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- [hangs up] Whoops. Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. [lowers voice] To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. [normal voice] Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys? What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what? Are they on their way over? What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it. This is kinda time sensitive. Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby? You look awesome. Where are we in the process? Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night? You do have a fantastic basement. Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl.[no one laughs] What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off? Wait, wait. So all the old guys quit? Well- Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great. [group begins leaving] maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut. [shuts door and sits, gesturing for Darryl to sit next to him. Then gets up to stand near Darryl.] Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing? You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so... Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about. We need you, OK? OK? Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor. I need a job. Good. Keepin' 'em honest. Are we scaring them straight....? I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one. How much longer is this gonna take? No. Because they all left. I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn't help. What are you talking about? I'm not gonna f*re you. .....OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke. Surprise! Your new crew. Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy? Yeah. Haha, what? Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that? None, no part of this has anything to do with you. Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class. Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a sh*t and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause] OK what? Ah, OK. My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto b*lls. It's gonna be determined by two big black b*lls. I control my destiny. I do. Oh hey guys. Uh, it's not totally empty. OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this. OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things. OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away. It's uh, it's in beta testing. Few other super simple reminders – no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl? This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it's a garden party. Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this. Let's hear from you guys, who do you want to toast? I'm not going to tell you how impressed I am that you're a manager of some rinky dink branch of a paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. How long are you going to go on needing my approval? You're a grown man, don't act like a little boy who needs... Guess we found Andy's rosebud. It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are. Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree. Hey everybody, I'm gonna leave and I just wanted to say I'm really sorry. Jim, put it on. Come on, the Three Amigos. Oh my god! Thanks. It's on medium. I should go. Got it. Unleash the hellstorm. [laughs] Nice. You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby. I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So...my pitch is...me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine. Is that off again? Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today. Are you really this lazy? First. Second. Thirrrr....third. It's for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I'm Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don't be nervous. Hi, gabe. It's like a hula hoop. Right. Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way. Hmm...Heda. [alert] No. Hey Darryl, I was thinking, uh, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. It's a hundred dollar bill. Should cover it I think. Don't bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, ok? I want a decaf frappuccino. Val... Uh. Decaf frap- That's too much Doodle and not enough Lab. Don't quit. [Darryl eavesdropping, nods] Hi. Ooh, gosh! Officer. Did she have any last words or? Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible. That is so mom. Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we'd save her from Ryan right? I'm delivering it from the fridge. It's like a p*rn. Hey did anyone order a pizza? Yeah and we're not about to make love. I just thought maybe you'd want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes. [scatting] Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray. We're called Kevin and the Zits. Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit! I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life! Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is Curtis Dorough, local musician and the officiate at my wedding. Guys, I've got some instruments right here. [holds up tambourine and güiro] And she called it nuts? Are you serious? From Star Trek? I caught it. 'Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised. We had to leave because of creative differences. Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now. Well- Thank you.Andy and Oh baby I love your way. Every day.Andy and And day.Andy and All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil w*r. You guys... Get excited! Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back. [murmurs] Thought it was worth a try. Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride. Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl? We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is w*r. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left. [making pencil imprint] Dammit. You guys came. Where's everyone else? They're terrible. That's right Jim. [jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey. No. Putting a load on more like it. Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. [laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics? Well today's your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look? Your path from obesity begins right here! Ready? What do you think? You haven't even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on f*re. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let's go over membership. I'm going to need the first month's and the last month's up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month... Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire] What do you think you're doing? I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds? I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was? Eight minutes! Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James! That's what I said. This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked. First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor. I didn't know Darryl joined. You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh? Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again! All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want? No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal? What do you want!?! Oh. Thank you. Alright. Isn't that just for popsicles? Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. [laughs] I, in my, I... What should I wear? Good cookie. OK. Since when does a sweater mean "dressed up"? Am I your grandson? Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here. [shows bloody hand] Does anyone have a first aid kit? Stop right there. I love it. I didn't even say what it is. That's a great idea. I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, "this sounds really stupid." There is one problem with this plan. I thought it was a fun idea. Shawn Marion. You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen. Whoo! I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him. Yup, yup. You know, you are just as dumb at night. Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right? You in? Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in. Okay. Watch my toes. [does hand stand] No, I'm good. Thank you. Oh I've got him! Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious. You know. Your clients. They're all mine. No, just go home. It's all good, we got this. For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica. What do we have here? God, you're such a spy. You're wearing the beanie. You like it? I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat. I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for? What? Darryl, you shouldn't have. Can I open it? How'd you know? You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh. Oh, sorry I asked for the main shipping number. I just need the address for the warehouse? I want to send my girlfriend some flowers. Yeah, do you know her? Cool. Um, so can I get that address or...? Why do you need a pen? Oh Darryl, hey. Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn't get you anything... No, it's anything but cool. Now I haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes. [Hands Darryl pink slips of paper] Yeah, they're Nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they're all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I'll find you. Thanks, they're from my mom. Yeah. Yeah, that's her. [laughs] Yeah Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon. It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... [drops pin] I thought that would be cooler. Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through. Up high. I found my calling. I'm dying! Terrific. Darryl, I heard about you. You doing good? Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five! [whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please. Boring. Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry. You forgot one. With the dots. Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right? Hey, Darryl. You okay? 1434-967, paid. Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again? Okay, thanks. It's not a kid on a bike. It's a man in a car. 1-8-5-0-5. That's him... the guy I h*t. No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere. This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah. Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice. [entering Andy's office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some? What? You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or? That's it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl. OK, great. That's right. Your little finger. [singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth. [to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin. See? Oh, I definitely do. OK. All right. That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model. I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life. Oh. [looks away] [Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me. No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year. Hungrier. [holding mobile phone up] Go. [in feminine voice] And this is Sam. Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day. Don't make me be your pony, Kevin. What do you mean? I'm out. And so is Toby. What, you, I, I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh? [Dwight exits meeting room and helps Jim up] My kid didn't have a face tattoo. No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie] Phyllis says the same twelve clichés every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates. Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain. Just one. "This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book." Um... And your stupid face! [grabs Nellie's photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground] And your stupid office! [punches hole in the wall] Ah! Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that! [hears knocks on door.] Come in! Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal. How are things in the warehouse? The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it? Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like? What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now! Brilliant! Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20? No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster. Oh, great! Okay, oh... Oh, these tacos! Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph! So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great! Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty! Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious. Bad economy. Bad investment. They did not. I wouldn't. Coconut penis. Come on, man. Can't you just give us a yes or a no? I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh. You're stinky. Uh, Brandon? You would? Calm down, he's not. Brandon! Thank you, Biggie. Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here! [stands next to him] Right here? I love it. Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! [pushes Nellie off slack line] You suck. Alright, who's next? Darryl? I've always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears. [at Roy's wedding] Darryl! Ha-ha! What's happening? You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it. [sits in front of piano] I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim. Her body. We're gonna talk about her body. [to Darryl] Good. Great job. Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl. [pretending to read news] Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented. No, pause longer. Ha! [raises cleaver] This is for real this time. [Darryl hits play] Oh, a movie. What is this? No, no. No spoilers. Please. No. Heyyy! Study buddies! Getting things done. Awesome! It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it! Just clap through it, man. That was really good, Darryl. [shushing Jim] Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a k*ller singing voice, is related to the First Lady? It's me! [chuckles] I am related to Michelle Obama. I mean, it's distant, but... Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from sl*ve owners?[everyone raises their hands.] Hey mom, it's Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America's national shame, thanks, Bye.[Continues] Where were we? Uhhhh, yes. Okay. Your...productivity thing. Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum! Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now. Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had. Exactly. Help me po' mouth, Darryl. What if I said that my dad b*at me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy? You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here. You doing alright, man? Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager. Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right? No, I'm serious. There's always something better. Like hypothetically... if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have. Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into? Right? Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to... Right? Not even a thought! It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright! Oh, it's happening! Let's just keep it between you and me for right now. We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's—I think she understands... what this is. What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real! [to Darryl] You know what this is all about. Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake! [Darryl runs in slow motion on video]Do do do do do do do. Can't take the fail? Get out of the fail video! Week off. That'd be great. I don't want to teach you Power Point. Just do the tutorial. No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial. Mm-mm. Getting my wife a week off from work. So Creed is that dude's step dad? Yeah Jim! [Group claps] Come back. You were in an a capella group? That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy? So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy? Is that where the nanobots like to come in? Is that how they like to get in? Now folks, by special request, we're going to take it a little old school. There is a former Trebler in this room. Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal. Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom. Alright, what's the grand total? Did we make our nut? Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories? See? I bet you wouldn't sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl? [on computer] Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That's what I call the sun now. Ah! That's not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? [laughs crazily] So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time. Will do. Me and Pete are building a tower. Yay! Boom! Oooohh... you salty dog. There you go. I love Philly. Dirty town. Whoo! Yeah, I think so. Think that through for a sec. Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right? Uh-- Mm. [Chuckles][Daryl drinking the gluhwein in his office, with some alcohol mixed in] Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting. Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.[Daryl comes out of the conference room and starts dancing. Meredith joins him] Damn It! Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.[Jim fist bumps Kevin and holds up the pig rib. Daryl sits in his office] Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy? Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview. Right? Hey, of course. Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl] Go get 'em. I bit my lip at lunch today. How you doing? It's how it has to be. I know, I know. It's just hard. Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, "What are you gonna do, breakup with me?" Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight. Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch. You got dumped? Here man. [Kevin hands Daryll some chocolate] You need that more than me. Hey, Darryl. Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other. What's gonna make you feel better, big guy? Okay. Let's give it a sh*t. Let's make it work. You're not. I believe in us. But... [Val kisses Darryl] Darryl, looking good! Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him? You ready for your interview? Well, you shouldn't be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim. That's so great! Well, I mean, I don't even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so... These things go down all the time. Yeah? [to Darryl] You ready? ...So definitely looking to expand our market, but for now we're just concentrating on athletes that are popular here in the northeast. Of course, that's not a mandate. Alright, so what makes you think you'd be a good fit here? And as you know, I was a paper salesman. [whispers to Darryl] Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked. [group overhears and chuckles] So how about we start over, hmm? Darryl, do you have any thoughts on the company? It was nice meeting you Darryl, I think you'd fit in great here. They're the ones who put a fish t*nk next to a basketball hoop. It's like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don't blame Cece. Say they don't hire you. It's not like you're out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you. Right? Thank you! It's just Philly. Everyone's acting like it's New York or Paris or London. [enters] Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They're going to make you pay for the fish, and... they wanted to know when you can start. Congratulations. I guess you gotta move to Philly after all. Whoo! Pfft, "Athlead"? Please. They're too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it "Stumpany," for "Stupid Company." You're working for "Stumpany" too? What? "Loyalty pledge"? I wouldn't say a rage. No, you're not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl?  L-- Darryl is "dating" Dunder Mifflin. Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself? It can't be more fun than selling paper and paper products. Hey boss, you gotta jump on a delivery. That's what they told me. [sighs] Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun![We are young plays on radio] Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl] Yes. Fast food. I'll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day. Not like this. Thank you. Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go. [cleaning up milkshake in restaurant] It barely even feels like a prank anymore. [sighs] What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee? [on video] f*re in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go! [on video] I nailed that guy, dude. Oh yeah. [on video] f*re in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go! I nailed that guy, dude. Oh, yeah. Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell? You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero. [as Darryl descends stairs, Erin ascends carrying a giant teddy bear] Darryl. Meet... bear... ull. Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe. [in Darryl and Jim's Philly apartment] Hey. We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly. And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down. I'm couching it! And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this? Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients. [to camera] Who is this guy? We are k*lling it. Nice job, man. [confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that. Oh, um... Are you really mad about this? Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that. No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal. No big deal. Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or... [after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos] Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me. Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a b*tch is Malaysian. Hey. Yeah. Totally. [after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry. I don't think you had to. I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that? That's not the point. No, I'm not making bread. Darryl, it doesn't matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make. It's all good. Are we all good? What's that cooler? [to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse? OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or... Yeah, something like that. So we know which truck to van... Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'. Oh. Oh! [imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel? Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the... All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my... Two men? [other nail stylist speaks Korean to manager, both laugh] [gestures index fingers bumping together] Doesn't work. No discount. Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone. That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings. What?! [wipes nose] Sorry. Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler. So, that's it. I just wanted to make amends. [slides cupcakes across table to Darryl and Jim] Why? Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh. With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number. Eat Fresh. Now what does that make you think of? The Big Piece. Space dust. Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright. Come on man, sell it! Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends. I don't know how we'd go about doing that. We gotta get him. We're gonna go get him. [Reading from script] Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid! Yeah, Ok. [Closes door] Alright. Where were we? Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical f*re with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame. Are you in that paper documentary too? No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage. Darryl, what do I do? They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene. She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't. Do you believe in me? I said I can do a better one. Darryl... Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don't watch baseball. I keep forgetting that. I'm 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go? Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day. No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What's up? What kind of offer? What? Oh, my god! Wow, that is... wow. Yeah, we did. Hey, how long—how long do we think that's gonna take? Oh, man. Yeah, I can't do it. This, man. I can't do this to Pam. 00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me. What's going on? How was the delivery? Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I'm here. They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me. Thank you. Darryl, hey. Cool, are you coming back to say hi? Aha. How's Athlead? Wow. He says he doesn't want to. Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin. That's what he says. Whoa. You left us without saying goodbye. Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs. Right. Now. Okay. You got it, man. Are you gonna come to Poor Richard's and watch with us tonight? Oh, god! These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck. Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he's gone for who knows how long. Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van? Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl's next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we'll get this started. You have to! [everyone grumbling] Which thing? We have our decision. We want to dance with you. One dance, all of us together. Absolutely. h*t it, red! ["Boogie Wonderland" by Earth Wind & f*re plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office] [struggling] Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis. Hey! Didn't I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo? Hmm. I thought you guys couldn't come. Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? "Guten Prank" number one. Hey! Pam! Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How's the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time. Yeah? Aw! Jim, it's fine. He'll just get you on his cell phone and then that'll go viral. No. It's a job. Things are going great. Hey, did somebody order the chef special? [crying] I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It's every parent's dream. The Doc crew's throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight. Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear] You know what? Maybe we should talk. Oh, Yes! How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work? [struggling] Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis. Hey! Didn't I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo? Hmm. I thought you guys couldn't come. Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? "Guten Prank" number one. Hey! Pam! Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How's the merger?

How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work? OK. Oh me too. [puts hand up for high five] Same religion. 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent k*ller. No, it is the foaming barking k*ller. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing. No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said? Hey man. What's going on? Oh yeah? Damnit Kelly! It knows! It knows what you did! Return it! Return it now! Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible. Who's it? Thanks. Not so much anymore. It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need. Okay. [makes out with Darryl] Umm, see you later tonight. What do you mean you have plans tonight? Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me. Okay, I see how it is. [pushes a stack of files onto the floor] Oops. Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore. Hey, let's call this what it is. Well, I just need to know where this is going. Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire--- Get her Phyll. [singing] Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.Andy, Creed, Kevin, Kelly, Call Michael or Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. The people person's paper people. Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap. Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix. Oh boy. The people person's paper people. Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music. No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible. Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl. It is. Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point. Do you want to go play on the table upstairs? A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless. Hey. Darryl, [clears throat] have you ever been in a g*ng? It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um... I know, it's very, very personal... I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods? God. Okay. you're on the street, and one of your g*ng disses you. Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right? What is that? Really? I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other. Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place. Why are you dressed like that? Maybe he's going to church. Or court. [to Darryl] I think you look nice.Michael and I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college. [Darryl approaches as students throw basketballs] A little over the top, don't you think? Oh, no problem. [looks down] And he signed! He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately. I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. [to band] Do you know, um, "Goodbye Stranger"? Supertramp? [on microphone] Can I have your attention please? [music stops] I was waiting for the right time to do this, and I can't think of a better time than right now, with the music playing, and all our friends around, and fireworks going off... My parents are here! Andrew and Ellen Bernard. Thank you for sharing in this joyous moment. Miss Angela Martin, will you please join me onstage? [Angela shakes her head 'no'] Okay, then I will come to you, my flower. [knocks over Darryl's keyboard] Niiice.[ Kevin's Loan, Webisode 03 - "Exposed Wires" ] I'm not going to be mad if you give me the money! Come on man! You have a nice new car, Kevin. Look at my car, it's so old. That little dude may hurt me if I don't get that bank loan. I'm gonna sell ice cream out of a cart. Why not? [nods] I know. Come into my warehouse, we'll talk. We need a secret signal that lets me know if I'm talking too much. [female Loan Officer comes in] Hi. Thanks for waiting. [sits at desk] So, Malone's Cones, sounds delicious. Oh yeah, maybe a little too much. You have a great... vest. Oh well thank you. Mr. Malone. This is the ice cream franchise? Yeah, we're not interested. I'd rather not. Oh boy... [Kevin stands and drops his briefcase, papers spill everywhere, he makes a mess trying to clean them up] Sorry, don't. Abort, abort. Brad. h*t the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up. [smiles, looks to Michael][/b] Really, nothing? Family only. All right. OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts. All right, we're set. [glares into the camera and writes Jim's name on his list] Oscar, enough with the girl talk please. Hey! Darryl, would you do the honors? Hey guys. Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another. Yeah, I a baby daddy. Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby? Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby? I just saw this baby daddy- Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote? Well- It's- that's different. That's not a baby. [sighs] Could I? Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays] Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. [music stops] And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D. [clears throat] Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You're auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce! [Huey Lewis' Heart of Rock and Roll plays] It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price! Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of- 5 dollars. Yeah, that's all-inclusive. I can see that. Halpert? Hey Darryl, what's happenin'? Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again. Cool! Life is a highway, I want to ride it all night long.Michael, Holly, and They came up with that idea really fast. Was I? Really? Was I saying anything interesting? All right. What's the scoop, how far? Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast. All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable. Did Darryl touch you? My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy. Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. [they continue arguing] I don't know what I'm gonna do! I'm not gonna be okay. [has won the table w*r] That is all sir, you may go. Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald? Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck. You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you. Okay. Bye. We didn't break up. Okay. That's a really pretty song. Okay. Okay. Da na na na na. Da na na na na. Da na na na na. Da na na na na. Da na na na na!! [deeper] Da na na na na. [deeper] Da na na na na. Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love! $200. Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll. But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll. I-- I'm-- I'm begging you. I just-- I need it more than anything in this world. I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll. I only have $200. [laughs] Oh man, thanks, thank you, [tearing up] thank you, thank you. Oh thanks. She's gonna... [notices the doll is black] oh... Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind. We are, we are a family. Oh very funny. Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy? Michael I gave you a ride home last week, we spent an hour in traffic... Jefferson. Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot. Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen? Irrelevant. You are not reacting at all as I had hoped. I just don't want you to. And that's how you broke your ankle? Hmmm, interesting. How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it? Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country. I didn't know we were in communist Sweden. Nnnnn, that's not... okay. I will send this off to corporate. Make sure you hold on to your medical bills. Feel better. If they were dilated... Definitely. We thought that she was you. No, nah. I don't see it. Aww, Darryl. Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we're here to apologize ahh... He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed. Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain... Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form. I am going to scare these kids so bad. Lulu from The Fifth Element. That's really not the trend in vampires right now. I'm a hobo. I'm Jigsaw, idiot. Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face. It is the easy way out. You are not alone. [on phone] Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. [motions to Darryl] Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy... [covers phone] I'm making a sale. Sales. Honey and jelly sandwich time. [removes lunch from fridge] Oh, you got to be kidding me. [holds up squashed sandwich] Look at that. That's - You saw who did this and you didn't stop them? The sales department smashed my sandwich. You don't get it. That's what she said. Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit [looks to Jim for vocab-reassurance] Complicit. You were all successories! You can. Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to k*ll before work. Hey, nice office. You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink. Didn't we? I think we did. Yeah, the whole g*ng, Matt included. So happy hour. All right. So... when are you coming in for that free lunch? You're gonna want to come in on a day that I'm working. Uh, maybe I can hear more about that book, too. I couldn't understand a word he said. I think I did. But I can't take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me. Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that. Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. [pats Darryl's back] Happy Birthday. Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it] You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities. It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing. Well... Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone. All right. Let me know what they say. What do you mean? I don't know. Like he was... covering something up? Maybe. What's up? I got your e-mail. Okay. I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out. Such as? What? You don't know what it meant? How about "Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?" Absolutely. [both leave Michael's office] Your text said 911. Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily] What's bad? It's real bad. Oh, God. I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on f*re. Yeah. There what is? [in old Michael Scott Paper Company's "office"] We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy's demonstration] Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much. Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention... Make it higher? Okay. [high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation... [higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It's working. [in normal voice] It's... I knew it! We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! [Darryl discharges f*re extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing. Well, it does and it doesn't. A place? You sleep in the warehouse? Okay. Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on f*re? Oh, no, no, no... Oh my god. Was she cute? [in Meredith's van] I have never seen so many parking tickets. No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think. Just don't say no. And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs. Darryl Rogers? So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on. Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me. Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. [clucking and dancing like a chicken] Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man? Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face! Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday. What? My bad. Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine. sh**t, sh**t it. [Roy hits Jim in the mouth with his elbow] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression! Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up. What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason? Well, let's just say whoever was ahead won. No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday. [clears throat] Alright, so let's get this party staaaarrrrted. Time to bring out the big g*n. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a k*ller joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. [to Warehouse guys] Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just k*ller. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got? Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day. Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense. I don't feel bad. You look good. Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead? That's her? No! You banged her? No! No way! It... no. You wanna be Santa? Have you ever seen Santa? Okay. I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man. It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man. Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league. Oh, no. That is not worth it. Never. Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it. No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it. Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone? No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse. Come on! [on phone] So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring. Very good, nice doing business with you. Thank you. [hangs up] Yes! [chuckles] Oh, yeah! Read it and weep. Oh! Oh, look at that! [puts post-it on Phyllis' forehead] Look at me, Phyllis! Oh, what is that? That's my sale! [humming then dancing victoriously] No. Just ... You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just... So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some sh*ts. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear? [blows a sigh of relief] Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there. Flowers. Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself. Stand clear. I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine. Oh, oh, oh! We'll get somebody to clean that up. Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know? OK. OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh... I... That was just... I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement] I feel you. Not literally. Yes. Ah, you do. So... It blows. It blows, man. Gah... Absolutely. You know you're right. You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys. Dockworker's? Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks. The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them. Yeah-es. I'm just going to put this over there. Thank you to our hosts. That is! I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works? It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are f*re-eaters all over the place. Not. I said, not that. That's ironic. That you are afraid. Dinkin' flicka. [sighs] Dinkin' flicka. Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture] I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, "You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)"? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words. Darryl. Noble Darryl. [sighs] I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me. So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and... Well that blows. Hi. Oh, ok. OK, Hey, man, how's it going? That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me? OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not "packaging." Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people? OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it. And you sent that out to everyone? Sure. [knock on door] Yeah. Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat. You know what? Actually, let's go into the conference room. [long pause] I am declining to speak first. Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now. What? No, this is a power suit. [Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again. Ohh... kay. All right. No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway. Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes. Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise. [mumbles jibberish] [mumbling softly] That was a very good point. I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me. Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes. Oh. [scoffs] Come on. Be serious. I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much. I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub. Plus perks, yes. Fourteen years. No, please, please... Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes. I still think he's way overpaid. Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia. I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise. Well what am I supposed to do? I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous. [exhales] That's true. You know what? I should. I have been a loyal employee for a long time. You know what? I deserve a bump. Oh, so I'm crazy now? Yeah. Fine. [imitating Chris Tucker] Don't ever touch a black man's radio! ...Chris Tucker.Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way. Well... Mm, the Big Apple. How would we get home? Maybe I'll stay. Well... Hey guys, Jan is ready for you. Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity. All right. Today is Safety Training Day. Toby is leading ours upstairs. Yeauck. But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity. Hmm. I can, and I have. You're not allowed to drive the forklift. Okay. Um, her. Ah, fine. Yeeesh. [barely keeping his composure] "Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!" [laughs] And I fell and busted my ankle. I'm legitimately scared for my workers. It's on! Dammit, Michael. Pay attention, man. You really wanna bet? Ok, you're on. [mouths] Damn... What are you guys talkin' about? What are you--- Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. ... Only on the rarest of occasions... ...would I go near--- Wow, that is... that time really adds up. That's like... a half an hour, every hour? Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom. [to warehouse guys] Sorry, he is very lame. [takes book from Toby] Um, let's see. "Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter." Ok guys, you know what? I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation. Are you kidding me? Yeah, but ours was real, Michael. Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really, what is it? You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life. What do I have to live for? It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand, or what I want. The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be. Do you really mean that? I'm braver than you? I Braveheart. I am.
