No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers. I have no idea. That's why we're cursed. OK, name please. You're over 75 years old? There's no prize money. You're doing great Michael, look at you go! Oh God! My nipples, it's starting. OK. Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave] As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can h*t the ground running with a new system. Cool beans. Who is? I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred. Creed? Everything OK? [Creed has made his hair jet black] Everything's cool, dude. Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much? [speaking on the phone] Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing. No, sometimes its right. Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that? No you didn't. Listen, I've got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away. How would that help Creed? In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose. That is a good point. Like the witness protection program. Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-? Line it up Phyllis. Yeah, people like me I guess. [knocking from outside window in break room] Jim. Well I think Meredith was just -- Everybody's birthday. What do you want? You want a birthday pie? Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie. It will be Angela. Why don't you mind your business? Probably went to his head. Hey guys, what're we talking about? Oh, I'll take 'em. Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. [phone rings] [on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet. [on phone] Daat! And then an older gentleman asked you "Boxers or briefs?" It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or... No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message] I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go? Extension 128. [over phone] Hiya Pumpkin, it's Creed. No. Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet. Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here. What do you do here? ...Excuse me. Hey, that's good. Oh my gosh. Yes. No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers. That's not what that is. [spreading peanut butter on a bagel] What? I swallowed a tapeworm last night. It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat. And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it. Creed sold it to me. It's from Mexico. What about her looks? No, nothing. Nothing Michael! Just saying hi. [Michael waves "hi" at the phone] Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah. Oh no, it's actually really hygienic, Creed. I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back. Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says "Creed." [Creed dressed as the Joker enters] Whoa. Awesome. I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you. Six point five days. [winces as Kevin smacks him on the back] Ohhh... Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay? Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding dr*gs in this very office. [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears] Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that. Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks. No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time. The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win. Hillary Swank. Yes! [Dwight pulls f*re alarm] Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!Phyllis and Okay, I got it. Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card. If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest. I hope he's ok, I feel bad. He just sent a text... [quietly] Oh, my desk is over... [quickly walks away] Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up. Okay, it sounds risky. [leaning against Creed's desk] So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party. Oh, great. Seven thousand dollars. Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now. Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist. Oh Pam. During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.' I don't think he even uses the bathroom. Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper. These are shaped like paper. Yeah, yeah. The Shield. I know. Yeah, it's...kinda-- That's true. That's right. Yeah. It's casual day. Happy? [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office] Well, what if I just do this? Thanks. Oh, I'm engaged to Pam. Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter? [puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name. Let's go. Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa. Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place. Nobody! [approaching Jim and Pam] Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba. I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls? Step away. Jim. Four months. Do not mind! Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't mind. Catch you guys on the flippity flop. Oh this... call waiting. [answers his phone] Yeah, uh huh, well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes. Yeah. Nope. No, I think they're talking about me. Alright. Let's get started. We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises. I think it was Creed. Yes, what else? Disgusting... Nobody told me what people were, alright? So... label yourselves or take what you get. A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay. What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm. It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello? Well that's great. [hangs up phone] Turns out the paper was there all along. [sighs] Thank God. Y'all. [accent] Sir, there has been a m*rder, and you are a suspect. Do you love her or do you love the idea of her? My idea! It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good! Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you! Yes. Thank you! Wish me luck! What do we got? Creed, disqualified. You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality. No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love. Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this. Okay geniuses, how would you do it? [pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah! Yeah, I noticed that. Nope. [on Jo's jet] Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police. Yes, it's totally obvious.
