A celebrity sex tape. Not relevant. Not relevant. It all happened so fast. And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in. Cool. Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was h*t by a car. Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that h*t her. Oh, Michael. No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I h*t one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree. I can take 3 people. No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault. [groaning] I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke. Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine. [walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it. [sighs] Well I'm gonna start fast. Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle. Then I'm gonna end fast. Cause they're just stupid. [looks at camera] What? Yeah... That was um... Yeah, I gave him a ride home because... ... We're dating. Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right? Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So... Giant check it is. Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control. Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check. I don't think so. That's possible. Look into that. So I closed the door but the image of his... ... dangling participle... ... still b*rned in my eyes. See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear. I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended. That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun. They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat. Yeah. [laughs] Oh we're in last place. I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today. I don't know I'm really committed to winning. Mmm... Yes. Yeah. [holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00. [bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't b*at rabies. Nobody can b*at rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could b*at it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line] Yeah probably. Hey, Michael? I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just... What do you want me to do Jim? No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins. I'm still having a nice day. Hey. I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim] Yeah. No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right? You guys are together? Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. [gestures to Pam to get up] Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, [to Jim] stand up. [Jim moves over in chair] OK, here we go. [holding both Pam and Jim's hand] Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one. I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim] Hey... [sees both Jim and Pam] you two. Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know [makes quotes with fingers] relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really. Uh huh. Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know? Let's just wait. OK. Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains. You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you h*t with the car, we're goners. No.. [in awe] No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque. You didn't say anything to me? Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here. OK. OK. No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like "where's the Beef?" [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah. Hi. Nice to meet you. Why not? Hey. It's funny you bring that up because yes it is. I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but... I now find you repulsive. Eh... OK. Or him. What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever. Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now? What does that mean? Great. I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me. You should come visit. The city is... amazing. No. You don't know until you live there. There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city. No. You can't imagine it, though. The energy when you're actually there. You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you. Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless. No. It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds. And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They are unreadable. They're just numbers and boring and blech. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? [everyone groans] Doesn't have to be a racecar. Use your imagination. Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle? Hey... there he is. I never thanked you for coming to the hospital. Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut. Anyway, I have this Sharpie... And I was wondering if you could sign my cast? [lifts up dress to expose cast on pelvis] Can you write where I can read it? [whispers] I'll read this when I get home. Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you. That's ridiculous. I'm not going to be beaten by a website. And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done. Ehh, can't do that. Really hard for me to let things go. Yes like a chime or a bell... Got it. Carb up. Uhyeaahhh! Hello, Susan? Dwight Schrute. Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices. He's going through a break-up. [on monitor] You tell me. So. This is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now. Like twins. Alright. Well fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good. Just let me know who the winner is.Pam and Not it. I won. No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what? Ah no! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit! Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman? Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone] Fine. Good. Yeah. Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one. Goodie. What's up man? Make a delivery. Alright. I'm ready to go and I'm callin' g*n. Yes. Thank you. You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham] Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured... Same sort of stuff in here. Mmwa. Mmwa. Leaving Pennsylvania. One for me one for Jan. You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday? Wanna come over Friday? After work you guys... Yes. Actually I will tell you right now. It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password. So... What are you doing? No. No, I'm sure that's not. Na... Yes. Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us? Stop talking all at once! Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson? You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions. I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want. I think you're over-thinking it. Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our... Trouble. Okay, alright. He said no. No, no. What's going on? I'll just wave and introduce myself. I'm all over it. Okay. Good pizza. Different stuff. Which one's this? Perfect. Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight. You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired. Yep. Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time. [looking at nothing] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it. [picks up phone] Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein! None of your business, Jim. Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest. Dammit. What? Oh no, I have a thing tonight. How about this weekend? Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right. You wouldn't understand. It's a secret. I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will--[notices camera]-- it will be that easy. The Beets Motel. Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon! Irrigation. I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions? No. You could make jokes when you've made a sale there rookie, ok? [laughter ends] What? Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being m*rder here tonight. I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy. [Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare? Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose. Does Mose have nightmares? Is everything satisfactory with your stay? Great. Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff. Pam. 30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'. No, whomever is never actually right. She poses. Stupid. No. We wrote a good review. Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times. Table making never seemed so possible. Uhh-mmm [moaning] [incoherent mumbling] No you didn't. Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling] Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her] Okay. Yeah. Jim's just really passionate about Italian food. Best ad ever. [sings in the tune of the "Kit Kat theme song"] Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing? What? No, why? [singing] Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce. Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car. Who else? I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide. Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers. Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with. News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later. No talk, I'm animating. Are you serious? Oh my God, he's really in pain. Who's that? He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that? Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too. You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar. No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim. Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape] Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet. No no, you can go home. I'm good. You comin'? Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Thank you. No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real. Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player? [claps and cheer] Really? Hey listen, you ever been on a motorcycle? No, no, no, no, no-no, no no. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her. Besides having sex with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me. Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny. Jim, we're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it. What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. Corcroan dropped Staples. That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving. I- I have no words. Look at his face! Look at his face! We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing. Uh-huh. Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim. Yow! Are you calling Karen? Yep, get it. [throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha! It had to be done, it had to be done. Oh no, that is too bad. sh**t. Hey Dwight, he found it. Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever. Do you really wanna know? Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know. It could be badass. Yeah, it will. Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass. Teach her to offer Stanley more money. So, why did you and Karen break up? Was it the sex? I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is... ...awesome. Okay, I will start. Um, "A." [singing] "A" my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell... Damn it! What do we sell? Um... I'm trying to think of what we could sell. Ah, la, la, la. What is that? That sound... The air-conditioning leaking or something? I'm peeing in this empty can. Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go. I'll k*ll you man! That is just so disgusting! Why can't I be in the club? Afro wig, do you want the afro wig? Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down. You and I- And if we have to defend ourselves, I will s*ab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk. Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes. Okay, Jim. Let's move! Move, move, move, move! I'm breathing heavily. I can see the security guard's eyes. The eyes are the groin of the head. We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier. It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running. Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim! Dwight, you gotta move! I'm losing control of my bladder. Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim. Just say you wanna get back together. Jim? Uh, what are you doing here? What are you doing here? Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier. Jim, hang on a second? So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh? If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult. [huffs] Oh, things are going really well? Are they? They are? That's great, that's so great. I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam. Can you tell me more about that? Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you. Traffic, yeah. Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, b*at-b*at the traffic, mm-hmm. I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise. How on Earth did Michael call my bluff? Is he some sort of secret genius? [laughs] Sometimes I say crazy things. I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything. How humiliating. Would it help you to return to another age? A time of refinement, and civility. Oh-oh, come on! Okay, did you get it out of your system. Fun? Really? What was fun about it for you? Was it the death of the twins? Did you even read it? Who was the main character? Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? [Jim makes a face] Not real. So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go? Absolutely, yes. Really? Oh, you wanna go today? And I am always busy. How often can you actually donate blood? Your body only has a certain amount. Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame. A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands] Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself--- In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change. I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos. Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours. Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me. This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I. When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being. Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday. Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember? It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. [Jim exhales deeply] Michael usually goes with red and white streamers... What? [flashback to Stanley's birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do cr*ck! Not cr*ck the drug. Oh! [Michael laughs] So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive. Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh? Do you think it's a good idea? Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it. Ok. [picks up and reads memo] "Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today." This is really cool. No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun. Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake? I really prefer devils food cake. Yes! Wow! That was easy. I hate devils food. Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday. Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake. I want pie. I want peach pie. I want a nice cobbler. I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen. Tuna. [rolls in chair to Jim's desk] Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale. Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale. Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up. Loud and clear. [rolls in chair back to desk] Pizza rolls. Hey, Jim. [knocks] Hey Jim. Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea. Yeah... My birthday was two months ago. There was no party. 58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot. I don't know, I just thought you could include me. I just though you could add me. I don't see the harm in that. Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon. I'm allergic to mushrooms. [raises hand] Conference room? [raises hand] Hey, Michael. I mean Jim. Hey, buddy. What up? You are relieved. So what did I miss? Oh. Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake. Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out. That's what I said. That's what she said. I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard. [playing ping-pong] Game, son! Jim. Can I see you for a second? Sure. Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and b*at Darryl. Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is b*ating you. [flashback, to Pam] Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong? Sorta, yes. [reading off paper] "Mr. Scott, do you realize you just contradicted yourself?" "I did?" "Yes you did." "Can I go to the bathroom?" "No." "I really have to, I've been drinking lots of water." "You went five minutes ago." "That wasn't to go to the bathroom, that was to get out of a question." "You still have to answer it." "First can I go to the bathroom?" "No." All right! What is going on here? Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice? Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable. Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now? Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass. O. [hits the ping-pong ball, and it hits the net] Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. [to Jim] Do you have plans tonight? All right, happy Friday. [to Jim] Well I think we dodged a b*llet there. I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks? You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said. Hello. Yes I would. So, what have you been doing? Yeah. Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing. So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first? Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs. I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. [puts a candle to Jim's nose] Smell. When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away. Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy. I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out. [reveals a tiny TV] I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space? [moves TV back a couple inches] Voila, right in the wall. Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table. It's pine. I bet you are. Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth. Look at him, he's laughing. Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone] Well you don't need two of you to do that. Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself. I don't know. No, Baah! But he's married to her! No rhyming! Those aren't helpful. [in the garage] So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand [the chairs are shaped like hands]. So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles. Thought about it, I'm in. Excuse me for a second. [gets up from the table] Purely carnal and that's all you need to know. E-mail? Ok... alright... here we go. [takes down huge painting behind his seat and puts up a neon beer sign] There. [plugs it in] Oooookay. Fine. Get outta here. You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon. Jim? Pam? [whispers] Flooded. [Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe. Hmm? W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get. Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim. [to Jim] Who are you putting down? Who is it? Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah. Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...[walks away back to his office] I know. Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move. Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too. No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged. Hmm, I don't, know... Oh, right now? OK, so then, when? Oh, right, yeah. Ohh kay. I've been warned. Nice job. Yeah. I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one... [smiling] I hate you. [walks away] Oh, oh. OK, let me be. I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil. I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich. My favorite branch. How's everybody doing? Love it. Go. I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that. David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right? You did. Yeah. I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all. It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store. Would you have sex with Meredith? Do you think she'd keep it quiet? Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that... Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan. Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome. Who you dating? That's... I, I think that... You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow. Let's do it! Later. Did you not tell the security guard we were working late? Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool. When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it. No. Yes, it's Eddie. Hank, his name is Hank. Elliot! [to troy] Do you have powers? Jim was supposed to collect it. Hmm... Hello? Yeah. I'll get ready to leave. [on phone] Stop calling me so I can put on my damn socks! I know, here we go. Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish? Theyhappenedto speak Spanish. M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't... I love it! Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael] [with petroleum jelly on his face] Hurry, please. Can you breathe? Hold your breath. Ready? Ener-gize... Don't, don't-- If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no. Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim? Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme... [to Toby] I think it's self-explanatory. [to Jim] Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan? How do you live with a franchise this bad? Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance. It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation. This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it. Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want? Because you're very important? It's like a mock execution. Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out. Everybody, except Stanley. I can't find my glasses. Let's go! [takes golf swing] Whoa! Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole? And that. Is why. I need a smart intern. I can't complain, people love their junk mail. You know what Jim? I'm not really looking to change things up right now, I just came out here to get out of the office for a little bit, so why don't we just play, okay? Absolutely, will do. Oh! [Phil is stuck in the sand trap] Ah, dammit! Yeah I'll- I'll get it out. Thank you. [Jim's cellphone rings] AH! Come on, Tuna! Just checking in, how's it going? I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess. Talk to you later? All right! I'll tell you what. My fiscal year ends in two months, let's talk then. Sound good? Right on. [clink of beer bottles] Beers? You closed it? Yes! Oh! [runs into his arms, kisses him] Um, congratulations to you, sir. [they shake hands business-like] Well done. [cell phone rings] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. [phone keeps ringing] Hello? Hello? Hello? Jim, what are you doing? Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha- [into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute! [cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail. Hey, is this Dwight? Oh my goodness, you sound sexy. Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece. Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done. [office phone rings at Jim's desk] This is Dwight. Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine. Hey. [kisses Jim on cheek] Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design. Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome! I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw "congratulations" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack. So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months... Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great. I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay. [runs out of the office] Congratulations! Don't interrupt. Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website? All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website. Don't worry about that. Just re-log it. [hangs up] [listening to "Crash Into Me" on his computer] Hmm... Jim? [Jim comes into his office] I am downloading some N3P... Music... For a CD mix tape... For Holly. And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels. The two levels being, uh, "Welcome to Scranton"... And "I... love you." Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2? I think I do. Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears. Well, you're not a romantic. Oh really? Like, with who? Pam? Yeah, you took it too slow. This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me. I don't want her to get away. I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work. Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't... Why would you do that? Really? Well we all want a good party, right? I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me. I did it! [exhales] I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point. It was hard. I wanted to kiss her. Whew, oh God. [inhales] Laying a base. Laying a base... I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, "Hi Ryan." And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, "Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison." Absolutely. [dials and hands Jim receiver] Wow. Look at our parking lot. I have done things like um, "Beers in Heaven." Or, "Total Eclipse of the Fart." I like that one. [to Phyllis] Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again. Tuna! [hugs Jim; makes small expl*si*n sound] I'm engaged! Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow. Jimbo. Did you see Holly's butt? Why? I know. I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read "Lonesome Dove" three times. And that her butt refuses to quit! [follows Jim into bathroom] You have to agree with me. [follows Jim back out] That's insane. OK. Yes. Yes. Fax this for me. [sees Pam and Jim through office window, runs out the office] Hey, hey! [falls down stairs, gets up, falls down again] Pam, Pam! Hey! I took a lot from other poems. OK, bye. No, Michael. All right! Dunder Mifflin, this is Ronnie. Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't. [to Jan] Come on. Let's go in. 30. That's how I sleep at night! [on computer screen] I can see you! This is so cool. Lunch with a girl from my hall. g*n weddings. Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose? If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this? This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing. Booty call. Here. Wait a second. [removes condom from wallet, throws it to Jim] I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me. You want more? I know I haven't made this easy on you. [Dwight comes out of storage room alone, looks at watch.] Hi. [they kiss] Mmm. 'Cause-- [looks toward camera] Does anyone want to dance? Jim. I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year. I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history. I've even started volunteering. Giving back to the community. I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean. All right. Close the door. This is your fault. Your stupid friend zone. Attention! Attention! We only have a few weeks left. [looking at Phyllis] And most of you are just as fat as the day we began. I am hardly the problem, Jim. Gah, the dreadmill. [both laugh] What are you doing? Body image. We are here because there is something wrong with society. I want you to know. Kelly, look at me! I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are truly, truly beautiful. Give me a hug. [Michael hugs Kelly, his head in her chest] Mmmmmm. Excellent! Good job. You've already disappointed him so much. He can't be expecting a lot from you. Yes, you do. I do not! I do not say "Hi" Pam! I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right? No football games, recitals, karate tournaments. OK. I'm gonna write you both up for not working. ) P.S. I finally finished my summer project. We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly. Please? Ok, that is fine. Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok? Hey! This is not half-way! I did the math. I had to drive way longer than you. Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch. What are you doing? Oh my God! Oh my God! Yeah. Wet Tuna! OK. [on the phone] Well, I should go. No, don't. I'm mad at them. Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement. What? Why not? Come on, it won't be that bad. I thought you were already engaged. That was Roy. She was engaged to Roy. I got a gift for Pam and Roy. Do I have to get another one? A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here? [to Jim] To be married? Oh come on! He's right there. [points at Ryan] He was hired. [to Jim] Oh check it out, "Hired Guy." Time thief. Time thief! f*re him! Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates. Well... I'm not quitting. What are you doing? Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn? That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody! He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch] There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch] Yeah. Yo. No, I did not. Was that any good? Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it] Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica? Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool. No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal. You know what I am talking about. You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the... I will be honest with you. That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault. The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her. And I am holding on to her leftovers. [throws Holly's leftovers in the trash] None of your business. [Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine. OK, good. [on phone] So you know Stacy, right? There's no one from England, Jim. Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages. So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab. Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in. No, Sarah Kaya comes in. Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres. So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, "No way. You can't reserve seats." And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box. Yes! No, it's horrible! Jim, she might get arrested. No, Stacy is a boy. Ugh. Frustrating. Why can't you just be in art class with me? Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting. [hangs up] I do not like pregnant women in my workspace. They're always complaining. I have varicose veins, too. I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too? Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital? Hi, Jim! This is my baby. Hey you! Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month. I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going- I can't hear anything! I didn't feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly. [on voicemail, because she's calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam. Leave a message. I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but... I'll leave a message. I guess this is just one of those days. It'll get better. I finished my laundry. Got all my socks. Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you. And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer? You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now. But, don't worry, I'm being safe. And I'm headed home. I'm... headed to my dorm. Not home. Anyway, um... I miss you. Oh, my God, what happened? [Jim holds up phone] You are such a dork! sh*ts! I'm not drunk. Scranton. I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here- Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest. She thought I was McNabb. [laughing] Yeah, well, watcha gonna do? What's up, Roy? I'm not gonna h*t you or anything. You good? I'm good. What's going on with Pam? Yeah? Really? Huh. [laughs] Congrats, man. So Pam's happy? Wow. I thought you were a friend. 1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar. [applause] Nicely done. [dressed as a kitten] Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Cool. [buzzer noise] We were looking for "kitten." Hey. All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge. You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want. All right. We'll see. [to camera] No. Hey guys. Hi! [smooches] Pam, I haven't seen you in so, so long! Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right? Maybe Pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin. So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great. Cute. Yup. She only knows how to play "When the Saints go Marching In." Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right? Miles Davis. Chet ...something. Dizzy Gillespie. You don't! I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art. I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So... For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better. Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle. Thank you. No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam. Nope. Nope. Not yet. Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. "Schindler's List" parody. ... That's not appropriate, no. [on Bluetooth speaker] Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work. It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something. Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet? [listening in New York] I miss him. Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! That's my mug. Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one. [smiles] It is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back. It has my face on it. [Dwight slams something on desk] What was that? Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon? What are you mumbling about? None of your business. Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information -- I'm being sabotaged. And I'm going to find that person and punish them. You're an idiot. Jimbo, let's do this thang. [whispers on bluetooth] Good luck. I love you. What do you think I am saying to you?! Oh, come on. You too? [touches ear] Jim? Jim? No. [glances at it] Yes, I am sure, Jim. It -- I agree. So let's see what we can find out from reading. [reads] Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant. [points at Jim] Arrogance. And there's our smudgeness. Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist. Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called? All right, fine. [picks up phone] Brrring. Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything. What is your name, sir? Really, that's your real name? Yes, Michael. What? No, but I -- It's up to you to change his mind. Oh, no. What's wrong? Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited-- OK, as I was saying, right now we are having -- OK, our prices have never been lower. ...never been lower! That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client. Here we go. Please, Mr. Buttlicker -- I have to put you on with my boss. Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager. Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you? You are the master. Yes. On it! Get in! Get in! [he peels off into parking space] Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing "Centerfold."] They might be listening to us. Customer service might be monitoring this conversation. You never know. Better safe than sorry. Who stands to benefit from our downfall? Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that. [on Bluetooth] Ooh, cute shoes online. I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need? Who are you talking to? She's not here, Jim. Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself. [surprised] Ah! OK. [in New York] That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said! Good one. Yeah, he's weird. OK. Um, we're cool. [gets up to leave] Bye. [on Bluetooth] That was weird. Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath? Did you do something to her? Well, something's off. All right. Living in the moment. I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. [takes sip of coffee] Can I tell you what else I learned? What? Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one. Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. [Jim makes face] That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there. Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead. Well, I can't be the only one who didn't -- [sees mugs on Angela's and Meredith's desks] [walks quickly to break room, opens cabinet and finds mugs of Oscar, Creed and Phyllis] No. [holds Sheriff's Department mug protectively] No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut] Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators? Obviously. I knew it. Yeah. What? I was -- I was right. I was right. I knew it. I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim] I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head; she ducks] Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her. Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake. Hey, what are you doing here? It's Pam. Uh, I came to kidnap you. There's free wine and cheese at the Chuck Close retrospective. Let's go. OK. Wow. Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim's ear] May I? Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time? In Japan you must always commit su1c1de to avoid embarrassment. In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. This is considered to be polite. I am jetting off on an international business trip. To Can-A-da. Canada. T minus... [walks up behind Jim and puts his hands on his shoulders] One more week. [at school in NYC] Can't believe this. [pulls out cell phone... sighs] [over the phone] I just talked to my advisor. Failing. I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark. I hate computers. I have to stay and retake it. That means another twelve weeks. [pause] Can you do this for another three months? [over phone] I know. [starting to cry] Right. [over phone] Yeah I'm fine. Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go. Alright. [over phone] Love you. Bye. Okay. Oh, well, doesn't surprise me. Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy. You did it, man. [fist bumps Jim] Day one. Congrats. I'm coming back the wrong way. [smiles at Jim across the parking lot] It's not because of you. I don't like graphic design. That's it. [laughs] Stop smiling. I really didn't like it. It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton. But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it? Alright. First thing in the morning then. Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie. Heh, okay, weirdo. She said she was going to give it to him right now. [starts laughing] Yeah, they used to. Oh, can you imagine? Uhhgh. I don't know. What? So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place? Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk. I saw some email. I got peepers of an eagle. So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in? Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right. Today's a big day. Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom. It's got shag carpets. I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's. And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting] She's gonna love it. Right? Jim, don't listen to Andy. I think it's so romantic. Where's your place? Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry. We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there. When it comes down to it, it's a health issue. I should have written that. [looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me? Are you inching away from me? Reach your arms out. Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah. Hello, Pam. Jim may I have a moment with Pam please. Okay? Sure. [getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house? I don't get it. I bought it. It's ours. Let's go inside, I'll show you inside. [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor. Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet. Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall] Yeah, I am really sorry about this. I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there. Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood. [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door] I love it. Yeah, I love it! I mean, you bought me a house! You bought me a house! Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom? And the clown? I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this. What? Jim. Why me? Hey. So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing... I really think you should reconsider. Yeah, I know. But I really think you should reconsider. Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right. Okay. Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing. Yes. Ohh, God! Yeah! Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! All right! Cool! [laughing uproariously with Michael and Jim] Stop it! Michael. The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael. [all three are still laughing] Aww. That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage] What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- [steps in manure] Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?! No, copier's great. Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies] And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half] So suck it. Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you. I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king. All right, attention everyone. What's 15% of 200? [Michael doesn't answer] Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus. [wearing a fur coat] What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, [camera zooms out to see fake blood is splattered on the fur coat] you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory. Yeah, I guess, since I won. What is this? You're so pathetic. How long did this take you? Three hours? Yeah, no such thing. They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs] Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes. Oh, I don't think it's blackmail. Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight. I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter. "My horn can pierce the sky". Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks. And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit. Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod] I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift. And such a genetically improbable one. Look at that. How does that happen? King has sex with a unicorn? Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse? Alright... One more time around the block. I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way. Jim, Jim.... That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice. I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka. Yeah. [sighs] Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India. What about February 2nd? No, no. I celebrate privately. We'll do it quickly. f*re girl. [looks around] Too soon? I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area. I agree. You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better. That's my only wish. But you know what? My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice. Mmmm... chewy. What's up? Sure. I knew it. I knew some of it. It's Christmas. Thank you. I knew it. Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over. Wait, you still don't know... Hmm? You still don't know. [to Jim] What are you doing? Andy. [from inside his office] No, what I'm saying is... No, that's not it. I know. [sighs] How can he still not know? [whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me. I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything. Not yet. You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying. [boastfully] Yes. How so, specifically? Eager. And flexible. Really? It's too late. [sighs] Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it. Yeah, my neighbor got m*rder. If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin. If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to. Where's Dwight? I don't think so. I will fight you. What is your w*apon? Hey, this is none of your business. Mm. So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God. There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table. Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain] No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit. What's this? Hmm. It wasn't here before. Yours doesn't. No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires. What are you doing? She looks like a monster. Yeah, thank you Phyllis. I'm not voting. [counting votes] Five. Five to five. Me too. [smirking] He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing. Oh my God. Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker. [punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently] Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once] Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making. [blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin! This has been a test of our emergency preparedness. There is no f*re. It was only a simulation. No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president! You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth. He's going to swallow is tongue. Open your mouth. Come on. Don't swallow it. okay, that's uh, hard to keep track. How many is that per hour? I will divide and then count to it. We don't normally download films illegally. Because we're honest, hardworking people. But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him. Alright... Lily. [after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on? Yeah. [clears throat] "I state my regret." I want you to stay. I know but if I get it in deeper... Hey. Um, did my dad say anything about my mom? [sighs] I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it. You're good to talk to. [everyone is lying on the floor in the conference room with the light off, Michael is walking around with a candle in his hand] It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance. What did you say to my dad? After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment. Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away] [Toby tries to come on stage] NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY. [Toby shrugs and sits back down] I know where this is goin'. No... No. Spite her - ok [laughter] Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring? Give it up, he's dead. Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then. Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best. Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck? [breathing heavy over intercom, starts laughing] [over PA] This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration. [snickering] I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me. [wheezing laughing, starts coughing] Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it. [still talking over PA] Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets [Jim stands up, puts scissors in back pocket] because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine. You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert. What? You find it? All right. No. Oh, all right. Oh yeah? Screw you too. You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday. Go ahead, you do it. I insist. What he said was... [puts finger toward Jim's face] ...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads. [at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim's arm away] That's on my side. I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win. Hey, HEY. Oh God. Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months? Well, I'm not done yet. It's a statement of fact. This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer. Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's. Have you collected the money from everyone? How much do you have? [yelling] That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim! [struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Who is this? Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you. Uh, 24. 37. [chuckles] Okay. I'd like to contribute. [opens wallet and hands Jim a single bill] There you go. What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm? In juvie. Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers! For reha- What did you do? Huh? I thought you said yesterday was your birthday! You did? I wanna see the cake. I hate it. Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly! Right. I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?! Nice job on the cake, Bozo! Oh, the other one's watching. Busy! Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to sh**t herself in the face. You know what? I'm a little busy. It's not effeminate. It's festive. [blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too. It's in the name. You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid. Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite] Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you? That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed. Hey, it's not a surprise. This doesn't look good. Told you. You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake? Our theme, if you will. Cool. No. You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap. Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this. Mm, great cake. [while leafing through Michael's appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really... Oh, hi! Great. [coming out from his office] Hello, may I help you? ...Jim. Ayyyy! This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances. Really, Jim? On Cupid's birthday? Can I have a word with you, Jim? Yes, um, Jim. Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office. Yeah. And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment. Mm-hmm. Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest-- [gesturing Pam to be quiet] --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party. What do you think? He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy. Everyone here who's bowled a 280 please raise your hand. [Bob does so] Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand. Come on, Bob. Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly] Jim uses a 6 pound ball. Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back. Oh yeah. You can always model ladies' jewelry. What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom? Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They've been in there for like ten minutes. Yes. And I think they gave him too many fries. Aww. [Michael grins sheepishly] [looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What? Well, you should cover it with the broccoli. Do you think they dined and dashed? I thought we were having a nice time. Yeah. [exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it. Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate] My God. OK then. You didn't eat much there Jimbo. Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it. [to Jim] Who's there? Answer the door. No way, it's the KGB. I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight] I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm. Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.' Well that's not what we agreed on. Huh? You're asking him to give up all of his power. That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that? That's low, Tuna. Woo hoo. Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips... ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession? Invite them on the tour. It's gonna hurt. [on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't. I thought I did. So... Well no harm no foul. Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so - Thank you, Jim is with me. Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings] You guys are throwing a lot at me. I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her. [puts hand on Jim's hand] Like that? Yes. He said he would do the same for me. I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination. Give me the details of how that happened. What? You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting. Ding dong. KGB. [in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there? We have more houses to visit. 45? 15? 15. Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence. Jim! Enough with the classy, ok? I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here. Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here? [watches Jim grimace, copies him] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership. Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries. Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then. Strawberries? Not classy at all. Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us . [whispers] Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish. Yes. What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous. Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . . Why are you wearing a tuxedo? Uh. Your name is Jim? He just had to wear his tux today. Nobody thanked me. Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead. Whatcha got, Jim?... What is a two-way petting zoo? [Jim knocks on door] Come in. Hey. Number two? Oh, I didn't know that position existed. So you're the assistant to the regional manager? Any responsibilities come with it? So you keep this made up position? It's important to you? Yeah, would you, uh? It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner. See ya. See ya. [Charles leaves] Bye! I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life. Gives me hope. Maybe I will have one of own someday. [laughs] But I dream... so... Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job. You are head-hunted. Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial Kn*fe, Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual] PSST! PSST! Okay, oh okay, okay. Close your eyes. Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company. yeah! Can you believe... cause I know paper. I know everything there is to know about paper. Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline. Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes. Close them. Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this? Obviously. Oh, agreed, mmm, except... Jim. what are you doing? Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week? No, of course not. But now I want everybody. Jim! Jim? Buddy, Hey! Buddy, Jimbo? Did you have time to think about my offer? So which way are you leaning? Oh no. I'm going with him. I'm going. Alright, okay. Deal! Okay, well... Jim? Probably. Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here. Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom! Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call. Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it. Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer. It is 1-3-4, Kev! [Kevin runs to the phone] Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? [Charles sees Stanley with his crossword, Charles stares and he puts it away] Thank you. So, umm... What? This is how I breathe. Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front. No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear "yes". Cool! What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game? Well, it's not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs] Yeah? Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it. Wow. You can be so modest sometimes. Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around. Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table. Okay. See you on the field, there, bro. See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait! Miner - [kicking a piece of trash] ...sees his partner - Halpert. He looks up! Defending duo! He sets him up! [Jim moves the piece of trash with his hands] He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho! Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you. Jim. What do you play? Forward or half? Okay, striker, huh? Let's see what you got in those legs! Alright. [Dwight blows whistle in Jim's face] No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff. Why'd you duck, Jim? Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment? Does that make you feel better? Huh? It's Britney b*tch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company. [tries to parallel park, hits car.] Okay. Not gonna make this one. [drives away revealing plenty of space for the Cruiser] So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could... Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in] Hey Jim can I get a, um- Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me. Yeah. Okay. What the hell's a rundown? As soon as possible. Just get it right. How would we know that? Use it in a sentence. Try another sentence. I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important. Why don't you just ask him-- You started on that rundown yet? [Looks at Jim's screen.] Oh. Okay, great. Just keep it simple. You're working hard? On this? Right. I mean why work harder than you should. No thanks. Hey I'm here to see Charles. Well, at least you're still being honest with me. Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list. Do I need to? What's that? The one I have. I'll use the one I have. We're getting pretty good at it.[Pam and Ryan throw cheese puffs to Michael, Ryan and Michael throw cheese puffs at each other, Michael throws a cheese puff over his shoulder to Ryan, all three throw cheese puffs to one another, give high-fives][Pam yawns, two cheese puffs thrown at her, one sticks in her hair] The timeline's messy. Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing. What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there? It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down. When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance. I know a few things about love. Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things. Is it Stanley? 'Noishe.' That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know? And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim's fist] Ah, what'd you do that for? [fist pound each other] Totally. Hey, Jim. Bro, I do that all the time. Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok? Well, so what? Your body's a ten. Jim. [hugging a crying Jim] Okay, okay. Hey, guys. Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen] Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here? Uh, that's not what was- Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming? Would you let Charles know that David is here, please? Jim, hey. Uh. When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child. He didn't know any better. You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, "Drive, kid. I trust you." I say we fill Michael's office with bees. My apiarist owes me a favor. Yeah. [opens phone] Hey. I saw you called. We have maybe a month. I don't know what I'm gonna do. That's what Michael said. I like it. [over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up. This is Dwight, by the way. No. There's a lot I haven't done. Yes. Yes, I was gonna say the same thing. We should buy him out. Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him. You think they'd be up for hearing an offer? Yeah. No, Jim... I think you should go. [knocking on door] Hmm? We're not hiring, Jim. Listen, I can't make you laugh right now. Oh, that's nice. Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl-- No-- We don't have-- Maybe. Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks. That's a pun. They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money. That can only mean one thing. They're desperate. Which can only mean one thing. They're total failures. Quiet you. So how long can they stay viable? I'm gonna answer Charles first. You two are morons. Take it up with Toby. What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward. And I want you to reflect. And I want you to say something different. We're in crisis mode here, do you understand? The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together. And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone. No, you're too close. No, I'm not saying we do those things. I'm saying something like those things. Words will never be enough. No, pictures are too interpretive. Oh. Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim. Oh, I totally see your point. Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly. So uh, meeting is over, I guess. I'll see everyone upstairs. I do? Well--Where is that bowl? Michael Scott Paper Company only. I will--no, no. I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom. It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh? Sometimes it's best just to say out of it. [playing chess with Jim] No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do this, I'm gonna do that. You don't want to do that. So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter. I thought you were gay. Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute? I need your help. This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head. You're close with Pam too. Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice. I like his hair. Okay. That sounds pretty biased. Okay. Pam, pros. I like her. I think that she is a fast learner. Cons, she doesn't always follow through. Sh--New York and the whole art school thing. And Roy. She has a weird voice. I don't need to tell you that. I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam. Okay. So be it, then you've lost credibility. And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan. Oh, wow! Whoa! Not cool, Dwight. [Dwight continues laughing] Sure. We're getting married today. Tell 'em how it happened. And very expensive. You can't leave anyone out. Ok, just get to the good part. Funk is the problem and the solution. No... cleaning... up. They're beautiful. Yeah. You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand. Really? This is so cheesy. I like cheesy. Yeah. I think maybe I want a "wedding" wedding. Really? [phone rings, whispering] Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back. 00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes. [changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork. Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates g*n] Yeah! Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right? Okay. Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics. Tell them what happened last year. No, no, that guy who h*t on me. Yeah, you don't grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance. Jim. Pam. Nice day, huh? Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. [walks away] Do you want me to b*at him up for you? Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right? [serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win! [falls] Oof! Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health. I guess that's it for you, Jim. I can't wait. Eight? [walking on Pam's desk, then Jim's desk] Extreme! Parkour! [talking head with Jim] We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant. Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum. Nope. Can't back out now, Halpert. Pays five million dollars. Nudity required. [giddy, whispering] Did you hear Stanley's having an affair? Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser... [grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved. [to Jim] Tuna, how come you never try to set me up? Women friends? Not guy friends? No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women. But off the record, I'm kinda confused. Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like... Yeah, right? How? Right-o. Ohh... Alright. [looks around uneasily] Well hey... Congratulations to you. [chuckles] Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro. Why did that come into your brain? [grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second? Who did you tell? [to Phyllis and Stanley] What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin? [entering conference room] Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors. Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator] Don't... get... on. Do not. [sighs] The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that... I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought "Oh, she has a new bra with padding." But then I thought "Pam doesn't need padding." It just didn't add up, Jim. How far along? Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair. Yes. Jim... Yes. A week? A month? A year? Did you pee on a stick? Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God. No, no, I can do this. Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over. [picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified] Hold on a second, Cynthia. Okay, Jim you wanna h*t the conference room? Oh right, this thing. I remember now. [whispers to Jim] What's this about? [walks into conference room on his cell phone, interrupting David and Jim] Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired. Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now. I will... I love you too. Bye. Alright, well I should go. Thanks for this. You've given me a lot to think about. Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak. Ummm... okay, here's the thing though. The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you. I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer. We may have to replace him. Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second. [shakes jelly beans] Little pick me up? [Jim accepts] Oh those are the best. Little sugar rush. Well we did talk about how handsome you are. Oh what a week, God. We said... I know there were certain things we said... Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out. Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy. Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion. Yes! Yes. Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face. Alright, Just do it. I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam, [starts to choke up] and now I don't wanna lose the baby. That's what she... Oh, oh, well here he is right now. [Michael knocks on desk] Come in. [Makes sound effects for door opening and footsteps and points to Jim to answer] We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton. Both of you guys working as co-managers. Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff. What's happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together. Jim Halpert, welcome. [in Jim's office] Sign this. Sign it. [in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint. You! One minute ago. Angry. No. No. No. Wait, stop writing that. That is not true. Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while. Yes? Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes? Welcome. Mm-hmm. Disruptive. No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important. Let's do. N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim? Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets... At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are. Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust. You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea. Yes. Alright. No more meetings this week. Mm-hmm? Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each. Stanley, you don't need to answer that. "If you don't smell this, you're fired." What do you mean by "these people"? Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room. Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want. What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time] No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people. That is not what Wallace told us. It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around. Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just-- Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision. Excuse me? Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it? Very good. Talk to you later-- [Jim hangs up] Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. [sighs, and claps hands once] Alright, I am looking forward to this. I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore. All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are. You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it. No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim. Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way? You use your brain too much. Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all. As I was saying it. [in nerdy voice] Con-- you look like a nerd. Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds. Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there. Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! "Mrs. Pam Halpert!" That's the first time I've seen it in writing! That will not go over well. Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna k*ll myself. No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue. And then another-- Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are. Ha! That-- I am not known for that! Yes! You went over my head to Wallace! Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me? Ah. Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?! Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? [laughs] You call it. [to the camera] This had better be terrible. Wait. Seriously?! Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with. Well? This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?! What the hell?! [everyone complaining at Jim] You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct... What about a raise based on merit? Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best. Are you making a-- Yep. [to camera] It's going really well, actually. Toby. Just wanted to draw a picture of him. Alright! Who to pick? [walking around the table] Who to pick? I... will skip a turn. Jim? [in Jim's office] How you doing? Oh, what are you usually? Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero. I know, I know. Yes, we did. Come on! This isn't fair! [at Michael return to Jim's office] Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this! You're welcome. Gin. [toast, sip] I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room? [standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding] What do you think? I spent all morning on it. It's just a really important day for me. Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day. So... you're going to provide them, then? Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding. Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers. Thank you, Dwight. [in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat. She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points. Yeah. Oh. No. No. That's not how it works. Halpert... Great. Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed. [laughs] Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word. Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and-- [talking quietly, trying not to move his lips]That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives. Well... I wouldn't care to live if I thought that. I'd like you to meet Christy Kelly. And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh. Yeah. Go ahead. Douche. Like... a year. What's obvious? Why can't Pam drink? Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation. When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation. Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word. Jim. That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it. I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me. Hey, smooth guys. Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning. [on the phone] Hey, hey! Where are you? Can you take Andy to the hospital? He tore his scrotum dancing. He is in my room icing his b*lls. Please stop saying what. Can you take him? Your brothers took you out drinking? That's Michael. You're out with Michael? [over phone] Hey-O! Okay, fine. I'll take him. Are you pushing me off the phone? Congratulations. No, it didn't--nothing got torn off. Who told you that? Okay great. [Isabel kisses her cheek] Yeah, I'll see you in a second. [pauses] Wait, what? [tries to follow, but veil gets caught on wall and tears] Oh! Oh no! Can you come here please? Hey. Terrible. My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels-- [sighs] Thank you. No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and-- [Jim cuts off half his tie] Where were you guys? Do you know how long I've been waiting here? [walks up] Yes! Yes! I have so much joy... in my heart... right now. How do I look? Saw it. I'm not gonna lock my door. [door closes. Then clicks locked] Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon. It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this. Just get in the car. Jim? Oh thank God. It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier. Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend. Okay! Jim? Are you? What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said. No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again! No! Oh my God! No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you! How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic? It really was. [voice cracks] I'm so happy for you... Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot. They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam! [reaching out with hands at chest level] This conversation has two items on the agenda. Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations! I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years. I have recently taken a lover. Pam's mom. Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding? About what? Oh, big time. She drives a green camry. And the seats go all the way down. All the way down. [laughs] What? Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright? [walks in] Hey, Jim. What did I do? I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy. Okay, I have a good thing with the mom- She's right on my way home from work. I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam. Pam, we're all set. [Pam places candy on Erin's desk] Yum. Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock? Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we? Come on, it'll take two seconds. Come on. [sighs] I don't deserve this, guys. No, I don't. [long exhale] Oh, that's too bad. Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here. [outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy! Thank you. You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott. Sure thing, Tuna Boss. [in Jim's office] How may I be of service to you? [both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke. What are you thinking? Haha! Ha ha ha. I have some ideas about conservation... [on phone] What's it... why are you crying? I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor. Hold on, hold on, what's going on? [to Jim] What! You knew? You know what it means. Shut it! I don't need to be friends with Pam. I have plenty of female friends. My mom, Pam's mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on IM, what's her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week. Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even... [walks into Jim's office and takes out ear piece] I'm sorry. Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me. Oh, I'm equipped... I can... Don't tell Michael... Night Erin. [looking out the window at Dwight washing the car] Awww, he did that for me? Mmmm. Haha, yeah. Say more nice things. Maybe I'm overreacting. But I don't think I am. Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha... [bumps into something] ... ha ha ha. You're not as scary as Book Face, over there. ...and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival. Sounds like fun. You guys would love it. They have a TCBY booth. The same stuff you get downtown. Do you like TCBY? I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour. They said the both of you. You should give them a call. Check that out. Jim's a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional? Wha- what? Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand. I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright. Let me get your stroller. What are you gonna call him? No. What is his name? Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal. Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing? ...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a t*nk. I highly recommend you wear that. They are into style. They are into appearance. We are selling success. That's sorta secondary. [offers Jim the watch again] Nope. No. Why isn't Jim wet? Nothing. Cocoa. Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond? No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying. [Stanley laughs] Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy? Message received, little soy bean. No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'. Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail. I want to make fun of you right now. No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid. Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over. Hey, let's watch this thing. How can we not watch this? We're not mocking, we're watching. No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this. No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't f*re all of you. It's alright. I can handle it. Oh. Did - did you see that? Why'd you stop it? Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in. I don't think you froze. No. Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But- Oscar's a douche. No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok. [holds door open as they exit] Oh, you guys. Just one second. [picks up phone] Oh my gosh! Are you serious? Shipping emergency. I don't think I can go to lunch. I know. Isn't that always how it goes? I want to handle it. I feel like its-- Well, you know-- Michael and I were-- talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales. What table should we take? So many to choose from. Well, as long as you're running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one. Let's see your six months pregnant, but you've only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to? Please be Grandma. Ok, there's a penny. What's that from? It was from the wishing well at the mall. You threw it in. I went back later, waded in and I found it. [reading] I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay... Home run Michael. [covering eyes] Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who-- who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I've never-- I don't know him. There's another woman. And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping. Well, hobbies-- Hey. Do you and Pam ever get frisky? I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other? Really? She strong? Can you stop this? Okay. I don't either. Mmm-hmm. I know. You gotta do something-- How much time do you think you'll need? You're okay. [screaming, Phyllis and Dwight wrestling] Got you! Broken arm! Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom! Ha, gonna flip you! How can I pose this to you in a relatable way? You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are att*cked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives? You cannot go wrong with a throat punch [screams, pretends to punch Meredith in the throat] False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me! That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present. Easy. Allow me to demonstrate. I am attacking myself with a throat punch. Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch] Block. Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist] Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both att*ck and defend himself] Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you're not. Ow! Oh! He really is, but not for long. [steps on foot] Ow! Instep, oh, not again. [more screaming] You let go, you let go. Oh, you're right, I can't hold on. It's $1.99 to finish the article. I wonder what it was going to say? [no one makes a move to pay for the article] I like Erin. There, I said it. I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws. OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody. Anything new on YouTube? Doesn't even need to be good. Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins. Monkey see, monkey do. Monkey pee all over you. Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room] Here's the deal guys. There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working. Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better. I only slack off when things are good. [Michael leaves] He needs me. Seat saved infinity. [leaves] It is so much fun. Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it... This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about m*rder. Tube City, you owe me one. That is the way Southern people talk. [tries to speak in a high-pitched southern accent] This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks. We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt. We can't pay... [in regular voice] - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern. [accent] Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection. We still don't know who the m*rder is. [everyone leaves] Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here. I can't do this myself. Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do? Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation. Let's listen up. Don't just say things. [accent] I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon. We need to reopen this case. I think Michael may have snapped. Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck? Both. They're both worse. [comes into Jim's office using accent] Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors? To Mama Juju Boo Boo. Hey shut up. You're dead. No Michael here, my name is- Caleb! No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room. I'll take it. Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late. Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet. But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good. We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year. Insolvent. So, well... You know what? I'm sorry, I have to run. But we will talk soon, OK? You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great. Keep after it, but I gotta run. Thanks Jim. [Jim comes out of the office] What's the news? Well, I guess that's not- A m*rder, you say? I do declare. Do we have to play? Get in there! One, two, three.. [all scream] 00. [accent] It wasn't me. I'm not goin' down for this! Bow down before Recyclops. Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter? Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin? Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns. Recyclops will have his revenge. The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child. A world where you truly can be anything you want. [the limo driver raises the divider window] Who's playing with the button? Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under. The company's probably going under, though. Seems like it's leaning one way. Definitely. So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff? In these uncertain times, Michael has managed to maintain steady profits from his Scranton branch. We all thank you, Michael. [scattered applause] Another bright spot in the Dunder Mifflin landscape, our new waste pulp re-purposing plant in Milford. [applause] Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy. Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things. It's not like you can f*re people or anything. Sorry. Plastered. Stuff gets around. I don't participate. Does and email count? Yeah. [everyone raises hands again] I don't know, man. I just don't know. Can you actually f*re people? Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone. Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'. Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. [crowd starts to agree and perk up] 45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. [crowd applauds] And you can take that to the bank. [applause continue] And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. [crowd has gotten very excited and is cheering] I love you, New York! [Michael does the spin and leaves the stage - then runs back across the stage] You. You. [playing Tetris on his computer] Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist... That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version. Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it? What? Great. Yep, that is a problem. Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim. Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away. [Oscar stands there stunned] Mmm-hmm. I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight. Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything. Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news. The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays. 0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat! Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron. Great! [sits down] Must be hackers. What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend? Lurk much? [Erin leaves] I miss Pam. Is that what we're going for now? "okay?" We used to go for "pretty good." Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better. I'm not in this for the trophies, but... Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month. Hey Jimmy, what's up? Cool. Very cool. I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office. That laugh is so infectious. I didn't mean any of those things I just said. And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud. Make it about the work. This encompasses all available data. Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation. Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency. Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize. In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching. I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data. [crying] Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, no! I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not? To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us. Yes! Yeah, you said "In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize." Isn't that what you said? Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. They're lithium. Correction. It was my idea. Yup. Hi, I have an order here for a custom cake, Jim Halpert. That's a lot of zeroes. Jim, what the hell is happening there? Yes. Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife? Am I missing something? Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier. If you can't do that, we're going to have a separate discussion. What? What? Oh, you're kidding me! Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. [yelling] Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of-- --the party planning committee... Hey, Rockefeller Center! Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that. Ugh. Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight! [others join] Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ... You didn't decorate it? Exactly. Is it, is it fake? Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die... What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong? Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa? Phyllis? Take it back. That is absurd. No? No! Jim! Come on! It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on! Well? The only Santa. You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved! No no no. Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun! Whoop! Okay, what? Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless! Do you understand, you forced my hand? Oh, do we? Do "We?" Is that what "we" want? Why don't "we" take a vote on it? Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are-- Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis. [on microphone] What? Was I not supposed to say it? [Jim unplugs mic] What? Turn it back on. Hey. How's everybody doing? You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas. And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, "How could they do this to us?" WHAT? You are kidding me! He said, we have been sold. [upset murmurs] Come on! David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone. I'll call him. I'll call David. I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don't know. It's real slippery out here. [sound of drummer's starts] Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert. In training. Hey. Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away. We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into. We're hoping our interview seals the deal. You'll find it easy to embrace the Sabre spirit. Welcome. We're very excited to go on this journey with you. You know what? Let me see what I can do. There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here? What? Who? The - The guy we're meeting with? Hi Jerry. Good to see you. Come on in. My office is right back here. This is the play room. Oh, so you saw it already? [cell phone rings] Oh. Got to take this. Sorry. Ok, you've got to pull it together. He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird. Sorry about that. Right this way. Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside. [drumming intensifies] Outside. That seems a bit premature, don't you think? I don't even know if I have a space for you yet, and you're already lining up your holiday plans. Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom? Seriously? You told her? And you - you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going? I'm being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be as charming as you think you are? It doesn't lock for the children's safety. Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job. Whoa, whoa! Yeah. I think I understand. Each of you is doing half a job. This is knucklehead talk. I'm not gonna bite it, you know. You can't give me gravy and tell me it's jelly, because gravy ain't sweet! Is it, Jim? I humbly accept the management position. those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now. Well, I'm gonna let this marinate. So you can go. So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year. This is way more than I make now. I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women. Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk? What? What? Really? Really? Well, I think you're both being a little too modest. No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people. [pointing to the window in Michael's office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown! Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? [Michael's phone rings] Michael Scott, head of sales. Who's hungry? 30 and say "Who's hungry?" Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy? It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain. Oh sure. Hey. You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here. Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch. I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here. We make a poster that says "Happy Opposite Day!" and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black. Lethal w*apon? What? What I'm saying... Fine. I don't care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it. [gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy. Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales. I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor. If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors. Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car... Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money. Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too. Ooh, spooky. But why? 00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out. Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet. No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes. Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks. Five minutes apart. Okay, stop watching me. Mm-hmm. My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book. No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore. I'm going to go look at the Internet. For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast! Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times. Stick spicy food up her butt. Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions. Why don't you go do some work? I know, you don't like to be frazzled. Okay. I think he is. Absolutely not. Hey. I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital. Okay, Jim. Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay? I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait... Oh, God, don't be mad. Mm-hmm. I know. Good. Okay. Oh, yeah, my water broke. Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital. That's right, let's do this. Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine. They're not that bad still, babe. No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay. No, it's passing, it's fine. Ah, no, it passed. It's good. Okay, I'm not going. I'm not... It's fine. [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it. Are you kidding? You can do this. You can do this. I'm petrified. Yeah. We're going to have a baby. Let's do that. Two minutes apart. Oh, God. Oh, no. It's okay. I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon. No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops. No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it. Yes. [as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] "We" don't. By the bushes? I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends. Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on. Wait, wait. My iPod's not in here! It has the birth song on it! Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack. I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it. It's only twenty minutes past the hospital! Okay. Do you have everything, guys? Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay. [he throws the keys into bushes across the street] I just did. Daddy? She's ready to push. Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go. Not yet. You're starting, you're kinda losing them. [with Jim, holding the baby] She's incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again? Guys, guys! Eleven pounds... Hi there. Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee. Ooh, somebody has a full diaper. Oh. Let me get it. Oh, okay. Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael. Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents? How we doing? She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You've been through a lot. [as the baby yawns] Oh, big yawn. One, and then wrap around. It's okay. Hold that arm down. She's not gonna... Just... Go. Nurse! I don't know. I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything. Doesn't feel right. How does one do that? Do you want to try it, Jim? Somebody buzzed? Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay? Alright. Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies. Hey, guys. We're short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy. Hi, so sorry. I know. Um, yeah, that would be great. Okay. Okay, well. Feel how I'm flicking the nipple? Like that? Stimulate it. Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh... And you can just... The baby should grab on to that. Okay. So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if... Yes, congratulations. Okay. Oh, sh**t. sh**t, she fell off. Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick? Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it. [trying to sleep as the baby cries] Jim, Jim, get her. Get the baby. Get her. Come on. I got her. Okay. Okay. Okay... Jim! She latched! She latched. Oh, my God. I didn't even have to do the "C thing." Aw, we're doing it. We're really parents now. Oh, hey, Isabelle. Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety... Oh, my God! Wrong baby! Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Sshh. No, not at all. Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di... Bottles are fine. A lot of babies grow up using bottles. So are you excited to bring your baby home? 35. Twenty five minutes. And you're all set with the car seat? That bottom part needs to go in the car. Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes. Do that. Yeah. Mm-hmm... Where's your car? Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around. Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it. Hi. We did it. Welcome back, "Dad!" Welcome back Tuna! Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks. Mega-Desk. Command central. Surveillance, gaming- and business. Oh, I love this, so much fun! There's such team spirit in this room! 'Morning Darling! Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to "How I Met Your Mother" that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them. Great. Thank you. [hangs up phone] Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please? They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy! It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic. Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life? Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now. What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on. I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father. I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother. [laughs] I'll be over there. [Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you. My headphones are broken. Can I listen to my music at a low volume? Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-" "- and the man in the moon. When you coming home Dad? I don't know when-" "-But we'll be together then-" "-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then." [Vocalizes and continues song] "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon" [Singing, Dwight supplies beats] "Little boy blue and the man in the moon." "When you coming home Dad? "I don't know when-" "But we'll get together then, we're gonna have a good time-" [On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home. Hello? Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. [Meredith joins behind Packer] What the hell is going on back there? What the hell is this? This is not Mega-Desk. That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks. Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. [holds up photo] Do you know who that is? Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans... [laughs] I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp. In my condo complex. I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie. [feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl? Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim. No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens? Yeah. Well, it wasn't him. I know, I know. I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman. Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque. [Jim stands in corner, texting] Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you. You writing your memoirs over there? Well, it's a pretty big check. Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people. I'm just saying, that - Thank you very much. Ah, just the stupid leads. I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis. Hey. Mm-hmm. Okay. [passes Jim some index cards] Alright. Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic? I do understand it. [over phone] Hey baby, what's up? Nothing but vomit and diapers over here. Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more. Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair. He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca. What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car] Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.' The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha. [to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't - Why? What drama? So unnecessary. I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that? Don't use your cute baby to make us like you. If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly. I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India. All those who agree, say aye [all present - Stanley, Andy and Phyllis - raise their hands] All those opposed - What's the least we can do to make this okay? That is a dangerous precedent. Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one. So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you - [stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty. Do you have any pastries without fruit? [enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our - Oh, what did you do today? [from desk chair] Oh, come on! Excuse me. A bunch of us are talking about happy hour. Oh, baloney. Ring her up. Absolutely, I will do that right now. I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much. [through phone] It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God! Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie. I want her to meet Michael. They're both single, I have a sense they might- Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God! [laughs] It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party... Sucks to be you. That would be sublime. I was a little nervous when Pam told me he was her boss, but he doesn't act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we'd never get anything done. About what? She's nice. Yeah. Uh, yeah, sure. About what? Hey, Michael, where have you been? [Michael sh**t pool ball up into their faces] Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning? [tries to wink] Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy! I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue. We both-you didn't dup- Maybe it should come from a man. You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop? Yeah. Okay. Bye. Oh-oh, gosh. Oh. Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady. [at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn't have watered it? [feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha. Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable. Jim does a really good one. Do yours. Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV? What? What do you mean, suspend me? I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension. I don't get it. Buenos dias, Jaime. [removes post-it, leaves] Uhh! You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] "I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee." If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives? This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together. We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes. Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott. Hi! I have a sense about these things. I knew it. You should see their baby. [barges in] Hi. Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret? Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me. [in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread? I'll have one. Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam. What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim? What? Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways. Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale. Is this... is this the best you can do right there? Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, [removes sweater revealing her revealing top] where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like. So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right? Maybe wee find some wiggle room? Why don't you run them again? Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says "no," then she is not interested. You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together? I was after your money. Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time. Okay, some for, some against. Um... I think it's really, really unlikely. Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible. I'm going with Pam's group. Here we go. Okay. No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck. Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work. Stop it! You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha! [chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you. Jim. Are you clicking a detonator? Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world. Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit. All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news. Oh!... It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God. Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update. Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life. Uh, Franklin Mills. Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael. [gasps] Did she see me? No. No! How about make-believe land has anything you want? I don't think he'd do that. Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big. No, I gotta go. Text me later. Me too! We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby. We can watch a movie and play Rock Band. He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him. [ahem][Pam snores] Guys? You were supposed to be the Lookout. I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad. Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics. Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else. I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. [Jim and Pam struggling to stay awake] Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way? You love it. There ya go. Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks. I don't think I'm gonna make it. [shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later. Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place. Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay? Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times. Yes. It was me. Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare... She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on f*re, spontaneously! Her husband's a reporter. So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do. I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael. All right. Sounds good. Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim. Gabe, I told you all about the printers. Okay, look, I get it, people. I'm the lame IT guy, and everybody hates me. You called me man? I just said my name just now, did you forget it already?
