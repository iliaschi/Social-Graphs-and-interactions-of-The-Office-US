Hi, can I help you? So this is H.R. This is your desk. Michael Scott, this is Holly. I'm gonna win. Yeah. T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness. [shaking Holly's hand] The pleasure's all mine. Any time. [whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin? He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain. Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos] Hi. I do the numbers. Do you want a M&M? Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them. Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram? I bet. I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off? Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in? You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player? All right. Yep. I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap! Hi. I can't decide what to get. Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips. [on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply] Hello, Holly. [Holly is on the floor with her desk chair in pieces] Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually. And the sequel, "Woman Stands at Desk and Works." So, I have no idea how you, [he sits on the floor] how you sit like that. [as Yoda] Sit on floor and put together chair we will. [laughs nervously] Yo-da. Um... So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town. Kidding. [overdramatically] Acting! [overdramatically] Acting! Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend. Hey! Hi, good to see you. I'm just having a little exit interview. Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler? Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right? Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see. No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud. How did you know? [clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up] I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't- [Holly knocks on Michael's door] [voice straining] I'm just worried about my friend. Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run. I'm cool. Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he? That's what she... a lot of places are like that. I like, uh... I'm really sorry. Yeah... Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. [Kevin nods] Okay. Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car? Okay, bye. [singing, screaming into the mic] Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by! Oh, hey. Thanks. Just hurry. [hangs up] Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me. I don't know, I just, I really thought Jim was gonna propose tonight... Hey. Yeah? Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar. [they chuckle] Oh... Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there. I'll go to the diner with you. Yeah, we can go eat pie. Me too. Have a good night. Bye. I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked. Pam, you weigh 226 pounds? Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200... I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my f*re. Here's what I used to look like. [holds up old photo] Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted. Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City. Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch. I'm gay! What's the joke? Oh, you think it's a choice? I'm messing with you, Holly. Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go. [rapping] I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat! Please sit down. When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father. That's his ex. Yes, she is. And clinically insane. Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it. Hey! Thank you, Holly. Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded? Oh, Holly, that is very offensive. Good. No. They should not be in that room. Let's go mini-golfing. Uh... You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early? Yeah. Happy Birthday, Stanley! [kicks cake onto Michael] Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon! Who is slacking? So how was your date? [groans painfully] [exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan] Mmm-hmm. Saunas. [into phone] Phyllis Vance for David Wallace. [in a fat suit, speaking in his Michael Clump voice] Ohhhh! Bang! Boom! Say Clump! Why hello everybody! How was Friday night? Yeah, oh, hey. Did he call? No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy. What, what happened? Did he call? Really? Aach. I dunno. I always call everybody back right away. He'll call back though. Give him until the end of the day, he'll call. If he doesn't, he is loco. Ugh. Wait, do we have until the end of the day? God. Where is Jim? Aww, really? I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing... ...was that he was a complete stupid idiot. I know. I love Counting Crows. Wow, really? That's a shame. A shame to waste these. I want to buy them from you. I do. No. I do. I, I want to. Trust me. I really do. Ok? Alright. Alright! [tears up tickets] Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok? Case closed. Umm, can I pay you tomorrow? I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so... Is that good? Sorry. Pencils down! [Dwight quickly puts his pencil down] Just kidding, take your time. [trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John's "Let's Get Physical" starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing]Michael & Ok, let's give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax! [everyone claps] [clapping] Ok. Well done. Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy. I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree. Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. [claps] What? I'll smoke with you. I got a bag of cigars in my purse. Do some... do some work. [whispering to Holly] People expect a lot from these meetings. Laughter, sudden twists. Surprise endings. You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan. You need to be Robin Shyamalan. Do you... just... you're kind of losing them. Yeah, don't think about the stakes. It'll freak you out. [coughs to hide his words] Lauren, [coughs] enough with the pencils. I would not... steal the bread. And I would not let my family go hungry. I will go first. When I discovered YouTube I didn't work for five days. I did nothing. I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times. To tell you or not. And I'm glad I did. I feel very very good. Cathartic. I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble. You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity. Who hasn't? Good. Good! What else? Ach! Wuh--- That's crazy. That's crazy talk! Meredith! The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers! Hoo-ooh! Wow! What time we got? [checks watch] You know what? That's a good place to end it. Right there. This, I think, was a great ethics seminar. She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about. Right... what is wrong. Who's to say? Really. In the end. I mean because it is... unknowable. But, let's give her a round of applause. Holly, everybody. Holly! Get back to work. [everyone applauds, then leaves] [to Holly] Great job. I am truly impressed. That, uh, you really pulled that one out. Classic. Classic meeting. We should celebrate. Oh... Nnyeah. What ya gonna do? No... no, this is just a stupid formality. Ughh! For the love of God we're trying to help you... stupid bag. Well it's funny. Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. [Holly begins to write in her notebook] Hey what's going on here? I thought I had immunity? Well, well. Holly... lujah! It's a miracle, you're at your desk. Hoo-ooh! Reaching! You'll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out. Good. Would you care to bang it out over lunch? Oh no, no, no. Your food is no good here, my lady. [sweeps her food into the trash can, misses] Sorry! You know what? Let's go out! Dunder Mifflin's treat. Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it? Ethical. What do you think? What do you think of this place? Istn't it? Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic. So you're from Des Moines? Wow, that sounds so... warm. Here too. You know what my favorite season is? Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons. Wow, terminator, terminator. I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance. I mean, what sort of place is that to call home? And Meredith needs this job. This is her main source of money. Ok, new idea. We don't report it at all. We just punish her. Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months. I don't know. I saw this thing, like a belt with a key. I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying. Yes. Well... bleh busted. I don't... Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family. Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera] You get me. [on speakerphone] Listen, Holly, Michael, I just got the report that your branch submitted and there's a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having with.. Well, I'm not sure these circumstances warrant any action. Well, from what I can gather it seems like a gray area. Look, to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I don't know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that. I thought it was clear with you, Holly. Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training. Every other branch has managed to get this to us so if it's not something you can handle then that's a different discussion. How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, "I told you so." Gently with a rose? In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke? Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way. It's a trap. Now is really not the time, Meredith. Ahoy, matey. Ahoy. So, how you doin'? Um, listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest. It's all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I'm treating Ryan the same way. OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop. [wakes up on the reception couch] Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep. Where's Astrid? On a what? [sarcastically] That's funny. OK. [just hugs her, and she hugs him back and smiles] You wanna go out? Hey. That was really fun last night. I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs. Yeah? Oh really? Well... I, uh... [to camera] I let her win. So, when, um, can I see you again? No. Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good. [Holly's smile quickly fades] Because I am busy taking you out. [concerned] Why? Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight... Tonight's so... Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day. I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know. Yeah. Some of what we order depends on whether we're having sex after. [laughs] Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have sex tonight? Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first. No, it's lettuce. 00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes. [sighs] [goofy voice] I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy. You're crazy, go crazy. Do you need 'em? All right. Thank vous. [chuckling] What? Oh! [kissing] Not if we turn these dials [getting louder] all the way down. [whispering] Now they can't hear us at all. Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have. Yeah. Oh... oh! No, did you? Oh, no, my God. Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight... Do I? Yeah, I think that's pretty boss. Whoa! Twice. ... Right? Mm-hmm. [whispering] Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It's sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them- [Holly covers Michaels mouth] Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. b*rned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets. When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire. Road trip! Right? We're not. We're not doing anything. Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug] We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.Michael and This trip was longer than I thought. Ah! Ah! Ahhhh! [waking up] Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare. Four hours. Almost halfway there. Next exit isn't for five miles. Here we go, fourth time's a charm. "Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there.... [Holly sobs] Hey. Are you crying? Allergies? WHAT!? What's the matter? Sure it is. Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine. Listen to me. I like you so much. And I've dated four women in the last-- Not last - no. In like the last ten years. I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid. Yeah, good. Can we--- [Dwight pulls out Cornell mascot bobble-head] Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!! Yeah. Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way. I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road. Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend? Years! Yeah. Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy. You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well. We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think? Please? Please... So um... I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl [Holly hugs Michael] Okay. [they kiss goodbye.] Goodbye. We're just friends. [approaches Holly and AJ] Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know. Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right. All right. Mmhmm. [both start laughing and hug] Hey. Hey. [hugs AJ a little too forcefully] Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless. What is up with you two, Holly? Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported. All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse. Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin. That's right. I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry. [watching her eat] What? Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool? We could do a movie... sort of thing. Oh! Could we get a Delorean? Oh! [to the theme of "Jaws"] Dun-der. Dun-der... Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! [both laugh] No. No. We're circling it. [imitates Who Wants To Be a Millionaire theme music as both sit in folding chairs] Yes, I am. Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College. [screams] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!! Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in. I'm Robert Mifflin. [pause to see audience's response] Ah, okay. [both run back to chairs] Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a g*n. He sh*t himself in the head. I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful. I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer! [over crowd of murmurs] What is he talking about? Are we losing our jobs or not, David? Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo. Should've had hindsight. I think it went well. I think it was good. No, it was a tough audience. Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them. Me too. [long pause] We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch. Oh good, because my next question was "do you have a game to get back to." Well you guys should h*t the road before... I close down another branch.
