You know generally it's not a good idea to click on offers that you haven't requested. What was the exact offer? Yeah, what kind of video? Really, what kind of celebrity? How much did you pay for it? You paid for it? I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody. Are you kidding me? Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain. Yeah. Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse. Who was driving? Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances? Who's we, you and Jim? Oh, I bet Jim goes too. Oh, I bet you ask? I bet you were. I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with? There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques. Oh good, so we don't have to work. So, like a freedom tree. Pam. Pam. Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch. Excellent! Good work Pam. Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith. [still sobbing] OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little cr*ck. She going to be fine, so let's just... No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies. Alright. Oh? I will do some research. [Pam walks out of the office into the parking lot alone. Kevin pops up from the back seat of his car as if spying] Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste! [Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. [Jim leans over and kisses Pam] Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know. Pro-Am. Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice. I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight k*lled my cat. When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds. Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy. Did Roy ever k*ll one of your cats? So what's your strategy for this race? Mm-hmm. What? Why won't more people do that? [laughs] [Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah... I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything. Right! Wow! There it is. We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later? Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check. You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going? Which we are. What about a rabies nurse? Have you met that kid? He's not going to college. Come in. What are you doing? No I didn't, just please don't... Oh my God. Baquette. Eww. I can imagine. May I enter the room? Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that. European offices are naked all the time. Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so... Alright. So I heard that you were peeping on Michael. I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin] Oh, would you look at that. Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in? OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured. That's what I thought. Don't touch me Dwight! [runs off crying] ...talk about it. Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day. You are? That's a good deal. Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done. You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference. Hey. Oh wow, thank you. I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some? You guys! Yes! Yes! Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings] No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it] Blowing up balloons I thought. [reading sign] Oh, is... Ryan coming back today? I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away] Oh. Oh, OK. Great. [Jim and Pam walk away] Hey! Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months. Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun. Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything? Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago. I couldn't see your hands. [Jim shakes his hands] Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK? Hi, Pam. Is Michael in? Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here. Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you b*rned your foot. I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone. Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand] Hey guys. This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy. Hey, Amy. How ya doing? Have a great day! Hey. Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone? I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh? Be honest. That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it? For me, it was. Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a sh*t? Maybe try and deisgn the logo? Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look? Thank you very much. Cool. OK. Take a stand! I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff. I'd love to talk to you about it more. Do you want to go out to dinner tonight? Wear something nice. What? I just... I just wanted to have dinner. You're kidding? That's... great, I... that's awesome. [grabs paper with mockups] So let me um, let me look at these. Cool. There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it. Alright... Oh, does he? I won't be watching, and I won't. What? Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines. Okay. I had um, one of those danishes. You had carbs? That's awful. Oh I'm sorry. What? Nope. Definitely not. If anything it was a tie. [on monitor] Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read... Hello, Pam. Hey. Do you have any men that you can fix me up with? I would like to have a relationship with a man. Yup. You don't have to say it like that. Thank God. Hey, quick question. If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof? Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk? And that's when I knew. You? That was the moment that you knew you liked me? Wow, can we make it a different moment? A toast, better make it good. To avoiding a class two felony charge. Coat! [throws coat at Pam] Steak! Where's my steeaaak? Get me Armani. On the phone. I owe you an apology. Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you. Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle. It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs--- [phone rings] I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin. Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones. Where did you read that? How many in your party? Darn it! No, can't. I wouldn't understand or a secret? I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow. The Beets Motel? That is, wow. How are you doing this? I don't know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car] We have three rooms, each with a different theme. American, Irrigation, and Night-Time. Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6. [Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there? Yeah. Coward. What's so captivating? [everyone stops talking, go back to work] I like captivating things. And this must be really captivating because it's keeping you off the phones. I mean time is your money, that's how I know how captivating it is. Because how much time you spend talking. Good night. I don't know. Is he right about that? So. Me. All night. Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body. Not from a male perspective. You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves. I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times. Yeah. Really? Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain. Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses. Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall. Yeah. What'cha talking about? [camera pans to each face in the break room] Okay, I know what's going on. You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think--- Oh, I hate monkeys. I don't have a second job. Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers. How do they do this so fast? Is this power-point? Maybe you should. Whatever. The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings. You will never want to leave your room. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay. [to Andy] You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood. [sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away] Ah, dinner. Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be. Yeah? Okay. Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else? Hey. Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality. Yeah. [sighs] Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever. Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so--- Yep. I... why don't we go back to this animation. Ah, show me how this works. I hope you're not k*lling yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one. Okay. Do you want me to stay? Piss or get off the pot! Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns. You're welcome. I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. [dials phone] Pam, please clear my phone lines. The animation was cool. Pssh, kay. To be Edwardian. His best work. Sure thing Pam, can't wait. So tell me again why I can't be part of your club? Oscar? Okay, good-bye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please? Your best one? [Karen hangs up] Aren't you the guy that h*t the woman with your car? Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to m*rder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove, what the hell is that music? I know right? I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic. Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel. Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam. Shut up, you, shut up! This is the dumbest thing we've ever done. Damn it! Damn it! [banging machine] Very brave. [Phyllis beeping microwave in the background] Popcorn. Hey. Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club? Angela. Nope. The ashes. Michael. Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a "get to know you" weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him. Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited. Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day. No. Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness. I don't like it. [Angela leaves] It's a pretty good idea, don't you think? No... I think it's a great idea. OK. [Meredith leaves] That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please? 'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing. You never call back. All right, let's run it back. What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong? Guess whose boyfriend it is? You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there. Wow. Oh, I can't b*at Darryl. So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly? Bring me players. People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater. About what? Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts. Mr. Scott? Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so... I think I'm ready. ...Absolutely not. Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! [starts singing] Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong! What? OK. Bring it on. Think you can handle this? OK. Volley for serve, P. [serves] Except driving. Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa. This is it, check that out, can you smell that? [the room is filled with candles that say "Serenity by Jan"] As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here. Shame on you. Really? How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner? Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done. Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes. Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital. Oh! Yes! Yes. You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage. That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much. I don't know because I everything I own is there. God, does anybody read the paper?! You shouldn't joke about that. You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam. Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated. Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him. We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right? [leans across to Pam whispering] Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food. Yeah it does. I was his babysitter. Bye Babe! You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad. [holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe. So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there. Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken. [sitting down, rubbing his feet] I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed. [off screen] Hurts like hell. Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair. But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair. [holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman? Hmm... Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch. Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women? I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands. [on phone] Yo, is this his new chair? Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it. Oh, you don't know her. Your mom. Please, not at a time like this. [sighs] Oh really? What's her name? Burger King? I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot? Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me? [walks up to reception] Margaret? You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh] Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud. OK, sure. Let's do it. [Pam laughs] Have I not proposed to you, yet? Oh, well, that's coming. [smiles] No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame. Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works. Wait, I'm serious. It's happening. And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp. Wow. [Stanley laughs and high fives Kevin] Where do you want to go for dinner? Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe? What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh. No, no, no. I got gum in my hair. k*ll me... right now. Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am. Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now. Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead. You really don't have his phone number? I might have it in here. It's so random that I have it. By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam? [people raise hands] Hey, look what I found in the back. [shows a football to Pam] Wanna play? Teach you to throw. [on phonne] I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I've asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They're just, it's not... [Ryan is dancing feverishly and falls over] Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls. Why? Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on! Pam, translate. Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them. All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction... You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly... Would... Hey Pam, I really like your glasses. All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses. Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually... Like librarians. Could you just say, "these are due back Thursday"? Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff... Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake f*re him. Let's go. Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here. Figured I look presentable. [looks Michael over] You? [Michael dressed casually in jeans and sneakers] Went a different way. I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent. Show them what you brought, Mike. I will tell on you. Cool. Hello. Hi. [to Pam] Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me. Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, "only the best and the brightest." Yeah, the booth is lame without it. Are you mental? I... don't. Are you out? [Angela hangs up] Pumpkin's out, let's go g*ng! [they all make a run for the door, Dwight re-enters room with only Angela left] Thank you! [Pam hands him blank paper] What, what is this? This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap. Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock. Yes. And don't call me Shirley. Hey, can't really talk now, what's up? Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see. Oh, I like you. This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will "do" you. [laughs] No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know? You're welcome. I closed it! Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it. [standing way too close to Jim and Pam] Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good. [Jim and Pam stop kissing] Hello. Are you interested in graphic design? Oh absolutely, here, take a seat. I should let you know right away, this is just an entry-level job. It's really basic. We're looking for like, a self starter, someone who can meet deadlines, who just pretty much just go the extra mile, I guess. Great. And uh, obviously looking for someone who knows Photoshop, and Dreamweaver. Uh, Corel Painter, Illustrator, AfterEffects, all the basics. [laughs] It's actually not super-complicated. I mean I'm sure there's some sort of like, adult education classes in the area. But if you're really serious about graphic design, one thing about New York or Philadelphia, they've got amazing programs out there for design. Yeah. Sure. You should. Absolutely. It's where the action is. [presses button on headset] Hello, this is Dwight. Yes it is. Woah, woah, woah, Pam! Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim. No! [waves arms] Pam, I'm over here! Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets... I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around. [whispers] Yes. Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Hey... What? No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations! Yes! So when do you start? Wow. Busy morning. It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great. See how easy that is? Ohh... [they hug; she laughs] Great. You're-you're not in it. I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica. No, uh... [shouts] Does anyone have a camera here? [no one answers him] No one has a camera here. Uh... Okay. Hi Pam. Stay. I made it this far, right? What's the point? What the hell is that? Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby. My gift is forthcoming, Pam. I am going to give Toby... ...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that? It's the temp! [all are watching a YouTube video of Ryan being escorted out of Dunder Mifflin corporate offices by policemen] Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan? Ferris wheel's pretty cool though. Yeah, who'd have thought? [Pam sees fireworks being set up; smiles] [on microphone] Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. [applause] You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh? Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? [cheers and applause] But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter. Not my favorite, but... It's not my favorite... [sings] It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on. [singing] Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise... I love sex, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other. Hey. Hey, you know, I just realized uh, I don't have a picture of the two of us. Yeah, could we... One, two three- [takes picture] One, two, three- [takes picture] Almost, Kevin. Yeah. So you have the directions. You have a toothbrush. You have a cell phone charger. I have everything. [frazzled and out of breath] I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it? No. OK. Um, the last word is "seagulls." Call me when you get in. [kisses Pam] All right, call-- [leans in to kiss Pam] Sorry I'm late. I accidentally switched my alarm clock setting to Zapf Chancery. [laughter] Which is my terrible segue into our course, Expressive Typography in New Media. Some of you may remember from last semester I am Professor Monaghan. [sees Pam leaving] And looks like I'm boring someone already. Go to applications-- All right! So what is going on, girl in the computer? Uh-huh. No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello. [picks up computer] Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you! Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day. Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please? Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go. [knocks on door] Hi. Oh, my God. Ok. Everybody just act normal. Don't say anything. My ex-girlfriend. She's right behind you. Just... hide me. No no! Don't look! [Pam sees an old lady behind him] Uh, actually, kind of. Yes. I just didn't like eating dinner that early. [they laugh, Pam's phone rings, she answers] So, in the year 2000, fungus and even black mold was discovered growing in the cave. Some blame it on the new air conditioning system they installed. Some, on the high powered lights. [Pam's friend shows Pam a drawing mocking the professor, they laugh] Others feel that fungus is do to an over--- Quiet please. So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so... Now he is saying "Hi" louder. Umm... Hey, can you go to IM? Mm-wah! [Angela walks away, Dwight follows] [Jim gets down on one knee] I just... couldn't wait. Pam, will you marry me? So? Alright. I'll tell everybody here that you say hi. Why, what happened? Ah. That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them. I just didn't, you know, want a deal. OK. You know what? Here we go. [stands up] Uh, everybody? I just want to make an announcement. Pam and I are engaged. [raises hand] She's not a virgin, you know. [walking in] What's going on? Yep. [Michael hugs/tackles Jim] Make the party. Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis. [Phyllis starts inflating a balloon with a pump] Pump it! Right, the one from England. Oh. Right, that style. OK... Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen? OK. [clearly just humoring her] No... way! Ha ha. That's hilarious? Who, Stacy? Uh... [singing "Son of a Preacher Man" to Astrid] Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one... [on phone] Hey! You busy? OK, OK, so you gotta hear this. So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing "Son of a Preacher Man" and everyone's just staring at her. The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes! Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later. OK. [on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim. Leave a message. Hi. 03. You must be out or something. Is it me, or are we just a little off today? Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues. Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you? Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe. Wish you were home. Uh, anyway... Pam, line three. Okay, thanks. New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate. Paaam-o-laaaaaa... Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week. [phone] Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert. Hey New York, Happy Halloween! Thanks. My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin] Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this. Hey, future baby sis! I'm good. I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, "That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best." Oh yeah. This is nicer, it's fun. It's fun! Oh, he hates it when we pick on his girlfriends. Oookay.... Let's check there. Hey, how are you? Yeah. Right Pam? Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her. Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong? One. The point is Pam, is there are jobs- I'm just calling it like I see it. Pam, don't worry about it. It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind. [Michael and Holly cautiously pass each other] There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp. Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got? That is good. Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. [laughs] Oh, text message from my brother. "Pam cool. Welcome to the family." Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger. Aww. [on Bluetooth] Testing, testing. Hello, everybody. Uh, Pam. What do you want on your coffee?Jim and Sprinkle of cinnamon. I got mine. They were really good. OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use [finds a mug] uh, oh -- Snoopy. Dude, that is my face! Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something. No way. Jim, they are a poopy. [Jim coughs, presses button to end call on Bluetooth] I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. [taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year. Is there some evidence? No, she's not. Dwight, get out of my nook! Bye. What was? No, actually. I don't think so. I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party? Yeah! Woo-hoo! Pam Beesley? Who's that? Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close? Uh, well, actually there's something else I'd love to talk to you about. Can we go somewhere else to talk about it? [in private office] Um. I'm gonna take a big leap and I want to tell you that I think you should not move back to Scranton. Why did you come to New York in the first place? Right. And that's why I think that you should stay here. Because I mean, you -- really you just got here, you know? You can't do New York in three months. You know, it has everything. It has -- all the opportunity is here. All the -- the whole art scene is in New York. You know, it would be nuts to go back to Scranton without getting to fully experience it. I know. But all I'm saying is, if there's even a teeny, tiny part of you that really wants to be an artist, then I think you should stay here, because you don't want to wake up in 50 years and look back and wonder what could have been. And that is the end of my speech. I planned it all. Anyway ... I will see you tomorrow. A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha. This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure. And when you meet one, it is intoxicating. Just what the doctor ordered. [in office] Are you sure? Wow. I thought you were good at Flash. Okay, okay, it's no big deal. So you're not a computer geek. [looks shocked] W---Wow. Um. Well... okay. It's not--- It's not about me. I mean, this your dream. And you went to New York to do this. So when you come back you come back the right way. Right? [concerned look on face] You okay? Okay. Alright. Thanks man. I missed you. You're back. Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers] [Dwight comes over, starts to massage Michael's shoulders] Don't do that. No kidding. Hmm, I liked it. Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie. Yes, sure they do, Dwight. Mmhmm, yeah. Oh totally. Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still? No. Oh, oooh his mistress. No. I'm kidding. No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam. Good. [Pam stands up and starts reading note] N-no no no, don't. Hey, Pam? I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation. I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess. Yeah, it's crazy. But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up. Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me. I would just make it worse. I--- I would find a way. Hi, we received a call? We were tipped off about a possible narcotics situation. [walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home? Cool. I have a surprise for you. All right, ready? Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes. Tadah! [outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage. It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio. [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that. And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just--- You do? Really? Oh my God... Yeah, I did. [they kiss] No, No, we'll just board that up. It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about. Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please... [imitates drum roll] Can anybody guess? No, no, please. Please do not do this. So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good? Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine? Pam, you make more copies than anyone. You'll see. Yes. Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier. We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit. Hey. Mmhmm. Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier. Yeah. Beesly, are you threatening me? Okay. Yes. I have no idea. So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on. Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings. Yeah. You look really pretty. Yeah. Yeah? Oh, hey. I do. Oh, good. it was fun. We had a good time. Oh, thank you. Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars. You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars. Nine dollars. The boys' department. Look at the ass. Check out the ass. Look at that. [begins dancing] Unh. Unh-unh. Yes they were. They were. Mmhmm. Sits on a copier. Yeah. Very valid. All right. See ya. [Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you. Yeah? There they are. You got it. Mm! [gives Jim a high five] Yeah! Hey hey! Yeah! Unh! Got a call about a problem up here. Okay. Know what? Wait, what? Let's see... This is so stupid. Was that hot or what? Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done. It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- [Pam and Oscar come to the door of kitchen] Hey. I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all. Truce? I will grant you one wish. [watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes. Well don't look so surprised. You did not know it. Everyone knew some of it. You knew it. [heard yelling from the street] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis! Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by [in an authoritative voice] Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. [in normal voice] He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad. Whoo-hoo! Hot tamales. Uh oh. I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder. [thinks for a moment] I will respect the results of the duel. [still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation... She's got mean eyes. Ladies and gentlemen, even though the penis was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy. I'll be right back I'm just going to grab my tool box. [entire office is chatting] I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying. Oh, hey what is this? [clears throat] Oh, f*re! Oh my goodness! What's the procedure? What do we do, people? Not a viable option. How about 911? Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.] Hope you brought your appetitos. My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. [dumps popcorn in bowl, it's almost all seeds] Uh, damn it. This movie, a lot of buzz. Not coming out for another six months. Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges. And we don't know how. Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage. My dad spent the night at our place last night. My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks. Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe. Hmm? Who? Sam? Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay? Make a line. Just form a line right here. Sign it! Sign it now! Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast? You guys, they're making out. Hey. Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal. What? Mmm... Don't open your eyes. So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the k*ller. You never expect that you're the k*ller... it's uh... great twist. Great twist. Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say? What? Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents... Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing] Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right? Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. [clears throat] Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. [clears throat again] So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought [choking up, clears throat again] sorry. [laughs nervously] I think I have a frog in my throat. Um... [sigh] I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um... [Michael walks off stage, knocking over the snare drum] Yep. You're being replaced. You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. [looks towards the sky] I'm okay. No, I'm not. [through tears] Sam! Sam! So what did he say? Was it my fault? You ok? Yeah. [they hug] I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad. I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people. Could I stick it with a pin? [knocks on Pam's hotel door] Hello, good morning. Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. [laughs] No, uh, seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. [looks at Pam] Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy. No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie. Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go! [gets in backseat] Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night. Well that goes without saying. Hey! Look at what you're wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant? That's... ...kind of [retches] Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something. My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl. No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare. Then listen to your iPod, Pam. Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk. You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so... Is that why your wearing makeup today? No, I'm not even wearing that much. Ice Cream. Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked. That's what I do, steal my trick. What! No, don't worry, the chain is off. Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it. Uh, in about a month. His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky. Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that? Oh, yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky. So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim? That's so great. That's great. I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean. Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think. Why? I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. [opens file] "Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center." Juvie. "According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor..." Blah, Blah, Blah. [closes file] No. I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.? Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small. She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that. [scoofs] I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester. How's Jim? Oh my God, I'm so happy for you! You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She's the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. And person. Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl. Do I look okay? She has a boyfriend. How could she do this to me, Pam? I can't do the presentation, I can't- [voice cracks] ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God! [starts crying, covers his face] I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay? [exhales] And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die. [laughs] [sighs] Huh- [pauses] Does she ever talk about me? [voice cracking] [grunts] Your life. [sits down, upset] Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue. [sighs, falls to floor, gets more upset] Oh, wow. [takes deep breath] Ooh, okay. Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards. No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right. [sighs heavily] Okay... okay. That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. [pauses] I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation. [reading from the cards, in Forrest Gump voice] Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump. I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball. Want some pie? I went through Holly's things. I stole a sleeve of her sweater. I also stole something off of her computer. A document called "Dear Michael." I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it. No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it. Yes. How? I know, I know. You're right, you're right. No, that wouldn't- No, you don't have to do that. Okay. [leaves to get laptop] [to camera] Didn't see that one coming. Well? She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say? You're sure? I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something. Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him! Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony! Hi. Yes, I'm from Techstar about a new phone system for you. I was wondering if I could talk to Michael Scott. Really? He's never around when I come by. sh**t. How about I make an appointment to come back? That way, I know he'll be here. Great. [approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager. Hi, how are ya? Ayyyy! [laughing] What was that? I can't even imagine. You're only engaged once. Well present company excluded, but. Pam, really, they're back? --that none of us can be a part of-- Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me? We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob. I have a lot of work to do this afternoon. Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves. It is so nice to go out with another couple. No way, a 280? No. Bob, no. No! Yes I do. That is a lie, that is a lie. But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit. Oh God tons of it . I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat. Look at that. Bob ordered hot food. Here they come. No, just kidding. Seriously though, that's enough. Oh great, I have to cover? Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed. We were. [emerging from the Men's room] Empty. Oh boy. [out of breath] Bowling. Pam? Pam? Knock, knock. I know you are. Knock, knock. They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. [Dwight walks over] Buddha. [puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam's desk] Buddha this bread for me, won't you? [Michael and Dwight laugh] I, I need something to wipe my hand. It's true. Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa. Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please! No. You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.' My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. [sighs] That... [sighs] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial. OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes. That is not constructive. Right. No, that is what I mean. Apology rejected. Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please? There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes. I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him] French. Classy. Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott. [on speakerphone] Yes? Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello? Took me all night. Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam] I thought it'd be funny. I was never given a name. [hangs up, he and Dwight sigh in relief][Jim yawns at desk, looks up to see Charles watching him from conference room, looks up again to see Charles peering through blinds, Dwight smiles] How old are you? Oh no. I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room. What is that smaller stripper holding? It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay. [groans] He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it. For four more days. [interviewee enters office] Hello. Pam? When will the new copier be ready? You said it would be ready by today. And it is today. Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks. Sometimes. Then come back soon. [dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh! [examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you? Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a w*r we never should have been in. World w*r II. Deutsch... let me see here. That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus. Pam, listen. This order form. Instead of saying "Dunder Mifflin" at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else? You... oh. Somebody has been talking in bed. Pillow talk. This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now. Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients. Half of them, at least. I can do it again. I know the market, I know the price points. I'm on it, don't worry. So, how do I do that? Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape? Thank you very much. You know, I would love to put a pin in that. Little Ms. Thing wants attention. Meredith... [copier has an error] Oh... so uh... G-44. It's not ready Kevin! You know what. I had a great time at prom. And no one said 'Yes' to that either. Um, let's see... it's fine. Good. Michael is like a movie on a plane. You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch. And when it's over you're like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what? You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose. [Charles steps towards Michael] Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it. What? What? Pam! Pam! You can't be serious. You are? Okay. It's going to be great. Right... Executive assistant. Well, okay, lets go. Are people watching? I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye. My maid d*ed. Oh, good. My h**ker's here. [laughs] Hi. Yes I was. Yes I was. That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in. Thank you. Would you like some french toast? What shape? Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles] After breakfast. So how you feeling about the new company? You excited? About the new company? After breakfast. No, I'm whipping them. Just let go. Let go, please. Just gimmee - [doing situps] I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse. I'm not overwhelmed, Pam. Whatever calms you down. Don't patronize me, Pam. I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients. It's totally impossible! Assemble a sales team. A dream team. Okay, Ryan. He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package. Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met. He worked at that telemarketing place. Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor. Yeah. Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her. Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'. [sits down in robe, legs spread wide] Umm... Hey! We need to get you dressed! I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly. Oh. Wow. "Michael Scott Paper Company." Okay. Very official. "Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence." How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office? Okay. Okay. "Achey Breaky Fart." No! No No. No. "My Stumps." Like "My Humps" but a guy with no legs. We can do this. Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team. Where are we going? He seems really confident. Confidence. It's the food of the wise man but the liquor of the fool. He's taking a long time. Is it possible he's bowling? I mean, you know him better than I do. Well, it has always been a lifelong dream. I'm... Excuse me. Yes? Yes, it is. Yes. It is. Sixty thousand dollars a year. What are those, a men's ten? [Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he's doing. He's stealing them. Okay, okay. He's already paying for himself. Oh yeah. Sounds awesome. Vikram, you ask a lot of questions and I like that. Hey, Nana! Hi! I thought Nana raised some good questions. What kind of a name is Nana? Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that. What's that? Blech. Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many. Well we should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay... I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit. [walks into room] Okay. It's right in the middle of the paper belt. Yeah, I'm good. You good? LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair] We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea. I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.] How is it insulting to say that you're good at something? I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not saying one is better than the other. Yeah I make originals too. Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it! Just make that copy okay? That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand. You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all. This is from the sun. They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim. I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B. No don't take that, give that back! I'm gonna make a spreadsheet. Yeah! Go make a copy, secretary. Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small. Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own. Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right? 1,2,3- What are we gonna do? Rock the house! That's my corner. No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work. Can I help you? Hey! Okay. Hey Pam. I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken. Um. Yeah I know. No. Okay. Hey Pam. You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been? Yeah? Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown. Do you have a card? I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting. [The phone rings] It is a disgusting sandwich. [It rings again.] And the reason I tell you this story. [phone] Pick up the phone. Don't tell them we have free delivery! [Also whispers] They don't know that! Give him a guarantee. Just say the word. Yes! You did! Hup! [throws cheese puff to Ryan who catches it in his mouth] Hup! [throws cheese puff to Pam who catches it in her mouth] Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right. This is my solo. [stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar, a cappella starts singing 'You Can Call Me Al'] Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000. Did you even hear the music I just played for you? Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women. U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go Michael Scott Paper Company! [Michael storms into office] Wow. It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him. It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon. I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to k*ll them in front of you. Look at that old dude and his rolodex go. Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight h*t a bear. He'll be here in a sec. We can spend a couple days there. Hello! Time to make the donuts! Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts! [laughs] Hey Pam. We got the van at a used car lot. We think it says "Alleluia Church of Scranton." in Korean. It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it. Milk and sugar. That's what I said. We're, uh, we're doing okay. A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun. Uh, yep. We have 20-- of those. Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft. Like in a dorm room. You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top. You can sleep up top. Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin can't match your prices? [presses key on computer] Crunch. Hi, Jerry. Michael Scott. Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday. Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check. You're just out of business? Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it. We'll figure it out. We'll be okay. Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay. [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying "Idiot, Idiot, Idiot"] Oh, that's my new "Dwight" ring. Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin d*ed? I know. But I always thought that the day that he d*ed would be the worst day of my life. I was wrong. It's this. I would love that. I never went to Thailand. David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out. [stammers] Uh... Yes. Nope, nope, nope. Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it. No, man. You're-- you're fine. We'll have to talk about this. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We are so rich. No. Oh, okay. How could you do this to me, Michael? You just cost me $60,000. I would rather have $60,000, honestly. Agreed? Sales. Yes, she is. At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday. Yes, yes, yes! [whispering] Who is it? [to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid. It sure looked good on the mannequin. Well, thanks. I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though. Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them? That I didn't have enough time for them? Pamela. C'mon. [whispers] Guys. Psst, listen. Now is the time for action. I'm talking action-- You. Us. Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me. You two were the only ones with the stones to follow. That was us, right there. Mmm. Thanks for going out, guys. Ah! Mr. Bart! Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account. He was my client for ten years! Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on. I think you should get it. You really grew into it. If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael? That would go a long way coming from you. Pam, can you come in here, please? Have a seat. [clears throat] Well, there's no easy way of saying this. So I think I will just...drag it out. Since the dawn of time there has been-- I gave Ryan the sales job. There just weren't enough clients for the two of you. So I had to-- I'm sorry, sorry. [laughing] Yes, you did. Yep. No, you--no. No, you're the best person for the job. You're going to be great. [laughing] Oh, oh! You should have seen your face. Oh man! Oh, that was classic. Oh, really? Oh, man. That was really good. That was really good. I don't know, I offered him his temp job back. We'll see. He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so-- I don't appreciate you telling me what to do. So clean out your desk, you are through here. Oh! What's our receptionists name? Could you send her in? [laughs hysterically] I got her! Okay. How about a woman? Pam? Oh, really? Ok. Ugh! God! What happened to you people? [talking like a robot] We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work. If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day. Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court - There are other reasons to go to Ohio. So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period. Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated. Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite - No one. Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, " You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you." Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk. [waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you. You ready? Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! [Dwight hits Michael in ear] Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to "Y". Yes. Me, too. Me, too. [whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch? [wakes up, joins in with the laughter] Uh oh. What's so funny? [at company picnic] All right, you ready for this? Yeah. Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh] Come on, who doesn't like a picnic? I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt. Oh, right, some drunk guy h*t on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance. Hey, how are you? I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore. Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone? Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What? Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers. Settle down gentlemen. Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever. Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked. [hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah! Pam! You all right? You sure? Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at. No, uh- All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this. To be safe, we should do an x-ray. Oh, shouldn't be too bad, it's a slow day. So, no other radiation this year, no metal plates, no chance you're pregnant... Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order. [entering break room] Who's getting married? [shaking head disgustedly] Okay... okay. [leaves room] Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day. Wait, there's not gonna be a g*n? No g*n... 'cause that changes everything. What are you gonna do about it? There's no g*n, so... free at last, free at last! So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?Dwight, Jim & Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say... [to Pam] Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a bastard? Want me to say it again? [whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know. I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell? That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap. [quietly leaves room] [approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He's over here! Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open] Michael, don't. Stay. Who's the father? Who's the OB/GYN? [arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it. If everyone would like to see proof. Look at that! [grabs sonogram from Pam] That is the inside of your vag*na! [Jim takes sonogram from Michael] [to Jim and Pam] How long have you known about the pregnancy?Jim & You should've told me. [gasps] No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious. That sounds terrible. Sure. Hey let me escort you to your desk. You and Jim are close, huh? Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you... Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in. If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar. That's how it works. They inherit things through the breast milk. I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want you to ever lie to me. Have I ever lied to you? What is Jim telling him? That I can't handle this job? That 's bull crap. That is bull crap. Although, it has been chaotic lately. Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients. I will tell you there has been work everyday. Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here. Ugh, so jealous of your boobs. Is Ryan going? I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet. Just keep going. Hey. Yeah, I might stop by. Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77. Yes, I'm coming to your wedding. Probably, yes. Niagara Falls in October? Pfft, hells yeah. Nah, I'll just tell you now, easier. I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs. I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you. Uh huh. Right... Rude. Mmm hmmm. What's going on? Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts? We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much. Perfect. I hate registries. My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you? Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where. Like money? Like you-- you want my money? Will you take a check? Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, "To love's eternal glory." Wait til' Monday. What does a bean mean? Michael, what does a bean mean? Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding? Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now? Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift... Instead of $5,000 a year from now? How sure is this? The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game. Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the sh*ts. It's so bad ass. All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone. It is really special. Come on. You've got to be kidding me. Decent people everywhere will get offended. That's nice. No. We'll see. Good-bye. Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom. Yeah? Oh, wow. That's cool. [aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever. Lousy Picture. I know. We're pretty excited, too. Oh, I'm sorry. Somebody just checked in. I don't like that. So, which one is Pam's grandma? Didn't move my lips. I wasn't sure about your branch of the family. After I heard about your parent's divorce. But you and Jim are just perfect. God bless you. That's right. It is ew. It is very ew. You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you? Are you seeing anyone right now? Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick? When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman-- ...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok. I should have known. The hotels television set had a movie on called "Bruno" last night. The remote control had so darn many buttons on it, I couldn't turn it off. So I had to just sit there while it happened to me. I wondered, 'How could they pick such a hotel?' Hmmm. Now I know. I have not found that to be the case. Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me. And where do you think you're going? Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead? Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on. Are you sure? It'll be fun. I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket. I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital. Everyone else is too drunk. Just don't let me die here. [over phone] What? [over phone] What? [over phone] What? Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted. [over phone] Is that Pam? Hey, have her come out! Have her come out! It would be like Coyote Ugly. Pam, it just happened. [over phone] I love you! [laughs] No. Let's talk for a long time. Are you sure this is the right way? Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum. I was trying to liven things up a little bit. I was kinda doing your job so-- [snickers] I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding. Ah yeah. She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom. Is it zipping over your belly? Don't squish the baby. everybody see Kristie's stupid blonde extensions? It's like they were made from a plastic broom. Oh darling! You look beautiful. Oh, I hope he deserves you. Mom, you're totally projecting. You're being a drag. Hey, I'm going to go outside and talk to Dwight. [answers cell phone] Hey! Is this allowed? Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid. Where am I gonna go? Wow. You look-- So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry. Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey-- [takes her hand] Hey. You look just as I imagined you would. Pam, you're so pretty. And who cares? It's a stupid veil, right? There. Now we're even. [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss] You look great. [music starts playing and people start dancing down the isle] I begged them not to. I know you specifically put this song on your Do Not Play list. I'm sorry. Wait, what happened? You're okay with this? Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube. Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so- Pam, I'm sorry-- Go. Any questions? Hi Pam, is Jim there? Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi. It was. Puerto Rico was awesome. [goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh. And oh, Jim... So what'd you bring us? What else? [behind Pam, acting out blind-guy, groaning] Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair. Hi! Coco Leche! That's my favorite! Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first. [laughs] I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though. Frank and beans! You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide? You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy. [unwraps rum gift] Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah, no, it's nobody. [chuckles] Hmm... no. I don't. I was probably going to break up with her anyway. It is. You want me to be happy? Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine. More than a friend, a co-worker. It's okay. That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset. ...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine. [singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate? [sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure. That was a h*t job. If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster. So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own. Alright... Ok, oh no here's an idea... conservation... Nothing... nothing at all... it's all good! For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover? She's messed up man... Maybe you're right, who are we to... Let's get back to the matter at hand. I don't like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it. Do not talk to me that way! I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out. I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am... Me too... Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions. My mother's in a wheelchair. [walks up to Pam's desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec? Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution. Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know... I don't... um... I can't hear your conversation. Heh, heh, heh. You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her. [Pam storms into break room] Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom? Is that how we're gonna get past this? Cause, I will. Well, that is not gonna happen! Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy. You know what? I'm gonna start dating her even harder. [Pam storms out of the break room] Hey... [in the conference room] Hey Pam, can I see you for a second? So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day. So he generously offered to wash our car. Yes, he did. You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay. [Michael is seen debating on whether to come back in to the office] Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam? Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans! Yeah... maybe. He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me. WB! Industrial P.! Makin' cold calls. [singing] Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202. Yeah. I was gonna sing that part. How exciting! Do you guys know the sex yet? Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out. My mistake. Sorry. That- that's good for you. Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam. Doesn't matter what Pam looks like. Yeah. No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich. Well- Some couples don't seem like a good match. You two do. Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook- I love to dance- Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room- And a baby on the way? You must be so excited. Yeah. We are thrilled. In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey? Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me. Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too. [leans over and kisses Pam's belly] Well, that went pretty well. We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it. You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much. Yeah. What the heck was that? Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy. No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right? I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single. What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool. You think I can do better? You're welcome. Whoa! [leans back] Almost fell. [they both laugh] Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them. Thanks. How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales? Yeah, he is! He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met. Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is. Pam, would you care for a bagel? That's right. You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time. I'll try again. Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel. I have an early lunch. [walks into the office] Whoohoo! Pammy? Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend? Hey-- Please, Kevin. You're fired. [Kevin looks at Jim; Jim shakes his head] Sorry, sorry. Work with a bunch of idiots. Shall we go? Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent. Oh man, that's crazy. Right as we were on our way out too. Rarely. If ever. Let me give it a whirl. I'll talk to them. That's okay. So, Pammy-- are you still liking sales? Just want you to succeed Pammy. You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today. Today is about family. Welcome Scott family. It'll be just a moment. What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh, wait a second! You mean this one? Wow! Oh. Thank you. Thanks for lending me the books. [laughs] Sticking with 49. The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle. If anything I am robbing the grave. Oh, well I like Nana, but I also like the classic Grandma. Definitely Grandma. [nods uncomfortably] That-- Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think? So we should get the check? Yes you will. Gimme. Look at this wrapping paper. It's got the word love on it in every language. Wow. [whispers to Pam] Shel Silverstein. Um-- I have the measles and the mumps, a gash, a rash and purple bumps. And my teachers really mean-- Happy Birthday , I love you Helene. [hugging book] God... it's a scrapbook. Don't worry about it. You can just owe me. Oh, just went to the bathroom. I got thirsty. Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly. And then I met Helene. And she is great and she already knows and has done everything that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it. But, I think I want to do those things myself. Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much. But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her. No it's not. Wow. That just-- you've really grown. And I want kids. And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there. Pamela Beesly Halpert-- May I have a word with you in my office please? Well, this is a work related matter. Yes. Yes. Join me please, won't you? [Pam gets up and follows Michael into his office] I am going to give you a raise. Because of all the good work you've done. That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam. It's about attitude. Do you want the raise or what? Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached. [Pam sighs] And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude. No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to h*t me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or-- What? [nervous laughter] Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding? Ye-- No. Alright. I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just-- Okay. Okay. Okay. Pam, can I talk to you for a second? I heard about the h*t. Just-- make sure it's off company property, right? Okay, I think we should probably be okay. Okay. And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot. So its-- its all one motion through the-- body. So you stay a little low and there's a twist. You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm. [demonstrates punch] Pow! Yes. Yes. It has almost no calories. Yes. I know. [sighs] Okay. Alright. [Pam goes to punch him again] Oh-- God! Okay! [braces himself] Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose. Maybe that-- Yes. Holy crap. No! Feel better? Did you? I don't like my character. Delta Burke, I do declare. Now, shall we get to the mystery? That's clever, Debutante. Nice accent. You sound like Forrest Gump. You are- Or maybe he's just stuck in character. It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out. We're not going under. Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now. Come on. Come on. See ya. [Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'w*apon' on each other, Jim walks in] Really? Yeah, I want to go home. I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved. Humans are terrible for the environment. Mmm. [seated] Ok. Ok. How 'bout this? [rises, waves, sits back down] I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing. [demonstrates] [doing an announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott. [Michael waves, twirls and sits down] The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.Jim & Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam] I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright? Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment, is the only one who raises her hand] I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just f*re him? To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people. Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell. Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day. Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory? Oh, did you really look it over? Felt like maybe you didn't. [shows newspaper article and reads] "Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders" To change lives. We've already rescheduled seven times. Well... No. Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right? I'm not a bad person, I bring good news. Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college. Okay, all right. I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it. Guys, I'm starting to think Pam's not really even pregnant. Excellent idea, Pam. There must be some reasonable explanation for this. Oh, really? From what, two to four? Ooh. Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up? I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. [she awkwardly hugs Jim] It's been a long journey... but [sniffles] I'm Santa Claus! For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching O*ama b*n L*den. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail! That's funny. That's too funny. Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see. [points to Pam's' pregnant tummy] [singing] I saw three ships come sailing in, on Christmas day, on Christmas day... Who? Is it that obvious? [Pam starts towards Matt] No- hey... I don't think so. I had some. Okay Pam. Okay. What? Oh my God! That is fantastic. It's good, but it's not good enough. Keep working. And here's Pam. She's our international sales consultant. The NFL celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1972. Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao. Hi. Thank you. It's nice to meet you all. Undistributable. I think we can do it. Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle - Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down? And - [Jim seals box with tape, rips covered with stickers] Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves. [cell phone starts ringing from inside box] Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please. [Erin tosses open scissors across Jim and Pam] Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready? Why do I have to explain everything? You sure it's saber? 20. Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute. Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird. But if not, there's always the army. The infantry. [after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies. Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom. I just walked in on someone in the bathroom. I don't know. I don't know. Pam and Jim? Hey, I'm Jerry. No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular. Okay. Hi, this is Jerry. We should just go. He's really uncomfortable. What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open? Yeah, if the time comes, we can discuss it. No. Well, you didn't consider the fact that it might not be going super well just because it might not be going super well? I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly h*m*. Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss. What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here? No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs? Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together] No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably! I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd. I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken. I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast. [After Pam has a contraction] Oh, getting there, huh? No, no. I still have time. Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO. Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy. I cannot wait for that joke to be over. Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office. Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital! Because the insurance company only covers two nights. [after Pam has another contraction] That's seven minutes. Here we go. This is happening. Come on. Are you serious? Pam. I... Pam, please. Yeah, no, you really should. Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks. My old roommate. Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart. So, the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call. Because she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant. Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers. Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check? [as Andy and Kevin shout "yeah!" in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals. [as Pam has another contraction] Oh! Oh, alright. That's a good one. Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior. Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills? Okay, you know what? I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call. He'd probably know... Nope, nope, nope, nope. Come on, let's go to the hospital. Pam, let's go to the hospital right now. Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry. Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled. And you know how very rarely I use that word. Frazzled. No, I don't. [Pam approaches as he sits in his car] Hey. Ah, you know me too well. Yeah? ... Oh. Did you say "she?" Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl. Wow, we're having a little girl. Oh, man. Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better. Yeah. Alright... Hey, did you change? Oh. Oh... 35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we? We can do... What is October feast? Hollywood. We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels. I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I... Are you okay? Let's give it a sh*t. Hey, come on. Let's go to the hospital. Pam, Pam, it's time. Let's go to the hospital. Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out. Pam. You know what? Let's go. We got to go to the hospital. Two minutes... No, I told you to warn me at five minutes. We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is? You're not going to. You know where you're going? Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have? Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous! Okay, just breathe... She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised. Yeah? Pull over! [Dwight begins throwing various w*apon out of the window] You're not allowed to impersonate a police officer! Don't make this difficult, Dwight! Okay. Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We'll be fine. Okay, so what do you want to do? Okay. I don't need a key. No, no, don't, don't tell me. Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala. Wait, you alright? Why don't you get more ice chips? Okay. Really push this time, Pam. [Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room] Guys? Hello? Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna... Oh, my God! Look at her! baby, she's so beautiful! Oh, my God. Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days. No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still twelve on each. Great. I'm, uh... You know I think, uh, I think it's time for me to go. Love you, as a friend. Ooh, I want to hold the baby! Alright. Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to sh**t you with love. Great. Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night? Okay, great. Ready? One, two, three... I can't. She's too strong. She's, careful, though. You don't want to break it. I got it. Alright. How you doing? Really? Well, you're pushing the milk out, right? Wasn't it... It's kinda like a... Like that. Oh! Really? Must have sat on it, Pam. Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while. I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later. Yeah, she'll be fine. I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery. Oh, good. You know everything. It's going to be alright. Careful... Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there. Uh, hi, Pam Halpert? Hi. I'm Clark. Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant. Actually, uh, I'm the consultant. Got milk? Ha ha. Alright, let's see what we're working with. I'll get that for you. Okay. Let me feel here. Yeah, it's quite full. Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand. When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C. Uh, does that hurt? Are you sure it doesn't hurt? I think she will. It doesn't... Why don't you bring your baby over here... She's beautiful. Well, you're doing a good job. Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you. Okay? Please do. What? Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing. No need. I saw him do it. I can try it. Goodbye. Hmm? Okay. Sshh. I know. [hands the baby to Pam] That's amazing. That's awesome. that's great. Knock knock. Hey. Pam, she's gorgeous. Can I hold her? What? Okay, okay. [waking up] Oh,has she been fussing long? How's it going? Right, okay. Yes, that would be the smart thing to do. Uh, Pam, I will be right back. Would you like me to help you up out of the chair? Yeah, we just got a lot of discharges today. Five tickets on the windshield... Hey. You used my move, didn't you? Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim's desktop] I can't believe I'm missing this. No, Stanley, do you - I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you? How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.' So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them- Ha! Knew it! It's a deal. Okay. Why? You've been gone for a long time. Yeah! [hugs Pam] Oh, I missed you so much. Yeah! So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs. Yes. What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for? [Julie laughs] Hey. Of course. Um, I'm gonna do a lap. See if I know anyone. I know. Hey, you're supposed to h*t the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok? You want to just make a run for it? [Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this. Yeah, why don't you send the bill to 23 I Don't Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania? Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry. She can't talk to us that way. Well, I am starting it again! I think I'm gonna go. Yeah. What's he usually like? All right. See ya. Nice girl. [crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill. You all right? Actually, you didn't. [as Halperts arrive] Welcome back! Hey, thanks. It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off. Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die. [in Michael's car] Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch. Dwight, don't be gross. Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy. [removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me. Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you. I just like the way it feels. Just relax. Okay. This is like the Cadillac of pumps. Okay, I was just warming it up. It's not a big deal. Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean? Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together? So if you need anything, I'm right over there. Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days. [standing behind Erin] I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know. Really? It was Andy, wasn't it? I hope you find what you're looking for. [talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough. I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal. Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure... Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. [Pam hands Jim a note] It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension. Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice. Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch? All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee. [whispers] That's a good point. Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other. [whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore. You look exactly alike. No. Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant. Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it. What was that? Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale. Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale. She just crossed her arms together... that's bad. She does not like him. 'cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day. Well, the joke was on you. Pam? What do you think? Okay. What? In Japan, heart surgeon, number one. Steady hand. I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore. She suckered you too. Was it the cleavage? It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened. [hold up barrette] Well... Yeah, I know. I know. I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. [waves, returns to his office, clears throat, turns around and runs out of office] Yup. That's exactly what we did. Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas. You guys think Donna's cheating on me? Are you nuts? ... and... we had sex, too. How? How do I not make any more of it? No, no... Run what? Why didn't you just say that, Pam? It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives. I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says. Michael, no... It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok. God, this is so disgusting. I know. That's not true. [Pam stares him down] You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan. Helene? Oh. [to Pam] What? Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing. Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right? So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less. Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That's exciting. Hey. Well it can wait. It can wait. Oh. And they are having problems, so sh... Good in bed. Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching? Okay, weirdo. Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done. Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam? Who the hell is this? Who is this guy? God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what? I'm gonna k*ll him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to k*ll him. I have to hear it from her. I need to have her tell me herself. Right? I need to have her say... I need to say, "What the hell is that? What the hell is that?" No, God! No, no, oh, my God! Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna; Jim, Dwight, and Pam are visible on conference room window, they all scramble as soon as Donna and Michael look up, Pam throwing herself on the floor] Good work. [clapping] It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60. Do you want me to go back to the store? This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married. After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me. We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him. He's coming. [walks in] Hey everyone. Leave, get outta here. Right now! That's hilarious. No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there. I'm really too tired to do this. Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved? Hey. Oh, Hooters to go. Nice. That... exists? Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer. Pam. Can you two please join me in my office? Now. Sorry about that. Well, you were surprisingly restrained. Ah. I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior. I did. I have got big b*lls. [yawning] What about an energy drink or something? Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it. A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift. Pam. Write your own damn novel. What was you? You were the leak? Uh-huh. Why'd you do that? Yeah. Okay, just relax. Just need to relax. You leaked it? I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour. Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said. So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes. Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it. What do we got? [opening door] Hey guys, sorry I'm late. Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case. That idea sucks. That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just... I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
