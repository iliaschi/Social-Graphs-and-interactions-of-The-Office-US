Yeah. Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00. Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore. [in bathroom] I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple] Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause. Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do. [Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. [groans] Woooah! Wow! It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress. f*re guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan. You weren't here for that. Andy. No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer. I'm not driving with him. [points at Dwight] Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve. What about a gift basket full of cash? Literally. Yeah, later dude. That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing? Tuna Tuna Tuna. And he can get any girl that he wants. We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall] Convergence. Viral marketing. We're going guerrilla. We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street. Wall Street. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here. In other words, it is what it is. Buyin' paper just became fun. Hmm. Very nice. Very nice. Or zipadeedoodaah. Just ignore him. I was... mocking. I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale. Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me. Plan a party, Angela. Oh! And the entire world will see it. Oh! And here's $65.00 for your budget. Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down. Oh. And your cat's still dead. Yeah, I'm aware of that. But he's also being super annoying. And I'm not a perfect person. Ohhhhhh! Three hundred and five. Oop. It just made another sale. Three eighty. Four-oh-two. Yesss! Ten reams for the US District Court! Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter? Yeah. I withdrew too. Yes! Woo! Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again. Announce it again. No no no the first part. Nope nope nope no. This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight? No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza! I think she's efficient. I hadn't noticed. [impatient sigh] I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with. No. I think you should date Kelly. Uh, she works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby. That seemed to shut her up. Are you looking for dinner and a movie? Because you're not going to find it in that box. [Camera pans to Kevin giving an "are you kidding me?" look] Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box. What? I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window. So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice. And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again. That's why you're not in charge Meredith. Will you help me put it over there? Okay. Excuse me. Ow! What are you doing? I didn't ask you to scratch it. I'm not dating you. [smiles] Ah-ha. [answers two ringing phones] Hello, hey hang on a second. Hello, hang on. Yeah, what'd she say? You have to give us something... Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students. I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night. What's up? You're being gross. What moves? I can't believe that's not working. Um, I don't know if I really see you two together. She's very religious. Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe. That's right, you did. That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it. I think that's how they got a core. We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever. Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby. Nobody tell him! You got it, you're so close! Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think... Nope. I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out? He gives the best back rubs in the office. Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative. We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us. Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight. Okay. She's crazy hot. Great. No. I said I hate the, the style. Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible. 45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide. Andy, I can't hear this right now. She called you D? Oh D. [whispers] Oh D. That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people! And spend time with George Emerson. That's what I would do. I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right? What are you doing? Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club. The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office. Naturally, it's where I need to be. The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety. Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club. Someone needs to clean it. It smells like popcorn. Yep, looks that way. [nods head yes] Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable. Andy. Not your birthday. Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no. Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make. Alright. [Andy rolls back] OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here. Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy. Okay. Very nice. [To camera] I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party. Joe Camel! Joe Montana! That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right. No! Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan" What do you think about that? I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me. [Jan serves the food] Hey, looks great babe. Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away. I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all. [gets up from chair] Write legibly people. Hmm.. Yes. That would be bad. Nice. What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves. Where's Scott? Let's just meet back in an hour. Alright, what do you want? We did it. Nice. [fist bumps Kevin] Yeah, there it is. You're welcome. Yeah! It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick. Now he's never gonna come. Course you do. Ahh come on! No! No! Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, "That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole..." I dunno, it's a good feeling. Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice. Mmhmm. [laughing] It's a man eating cat food. Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy? Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological. [kicks the car] Unh! Scratch. Uh, bumper's sagging. This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing. you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey. Yes. You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now. Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one-- Five, four, three, two... Now. Now. Now. Say it. Do it. Now. Do it now. Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand. [washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA! It's my car now. Hey Jim, how are you, nice to see you man. Phil Maguire, Dartmouth, '74 [goes to shake Andy's hand] Yeah, you do. Andy, you're up, let's go! [gushing lotion inside his golf gloves] Giddy up, let's do this. People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my "knot" on. [silently working] [Pam walks back into office, gets paper out of the copier, shows it "voila" to camera, leaves] Yeah. Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy! Why don't... hey. Let's open a tab, because you and me are gonna be playing more often. No. Good playing with you guys. [gets engagement ring from his pocket] Hey... Unh! Damn it! ...Okay. I said, okay. She said yes! [light applause] And the crowd goes wild! Woo! [music starts playing; Jim puts his ring back in his pocket and exhales sharply] Well... it's my own fault. I know. That's awesome, man. That's great. Don't go breaking my scale. Just, we'll just keep going. All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke. It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind. What? Hey, check it out. [hands her brochure] This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper. No. No. I don't care. I'm sorry. No. It's not my problem. [dials phone] That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it. [walks away] Sweetheart. [Angela turns around] Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together. Hey, you know what? I can't do this by myself people! Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out. [flails his arms] Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok? NO! I want names! So we're only eight pounds behind Utica. Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all. Leave it to me, boss. I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge. I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff. Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy? Really? Mmhmm. The guys? I don't think that... I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band. [Angela dials the phone] Let's talk about this later. [Dwight's pager buzzes] What are you smiling about there smiley pants? You're late. Yes. This meeting. That isn't ethics. Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good. This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules. Exactly, Andy. It's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male. Hey, Andy. By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night? I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff. You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight? You know, it's weird. It's practically a sh*t for sh*t remake. Story's kinda bland. It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor. Can I have everyone's attention? Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please. We need to finish the ethics seminar. I got some in my minivan somewhere. [annoyed] Andy, would you like to have my baby? Who's Sarah Kayacombsen? It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose. That's Phyllis. Yeah, it is. So I hope you two are very happy together. Pervert. Well, it does. That's me. Yes it is. [tossing the stroller off a tall heap of tires] Playtime is over! [with Astrid covered in and surrounded by vegetables on a lunch table] That's good. Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here. Get the baby to look up here, ready? Now. Come on, up here! Your hand's in it. What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me. [picking up Astrid] There you are. In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I'll know for sure. [whispering] You set a date? I never felt safe here. I would very much like that. Yeah. Uh, what the hell is happening? What are you doing? [also dressed as the Joker] Dammit Creed! I've been up since four! Dave. You are? [Andy hisses] A cat? Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning. Hello. How are you Phyllis? Andy. No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying! Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong. Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage. Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be. Excuse me? You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home. It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the m*llitary. Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work. What do you say? No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God! What? Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's? That's a conflict of interest. [thinks] Interview. What? Okay. Who are your role models? If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance. That was k*ller. I was so close to blowing it. Bring it. Dale Raymond Corson! Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook] On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers. Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested. "Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process." "Interviewer has suspect motives." "Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth." Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need. And you will be hearing from the - -Cornell Application Department, And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy] And your affiliation with Cornell - Will end completely! [blues singer] Da na na na na... Where did you get those? I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this. I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay. I don't want to do that. [chanting continues] All right. [picks up phone and dials] She is going to freak out! You're not. Nope. You must be really proud. Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here. Don't give him Snoopy. That's mine. How can you even be sure? [holds mug next to Andy's head] Make the face. [Andy smiles] Yeah, I don't see it. I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser. [on phone] Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work. I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him. [shakes fist] I got him! ... [whispers] It's a million-dollar sale. Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long. There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over. No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable. [in New York, humming to herself to the tune of "Centerfold"] Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na. [at computer, spins chair around and makes triumphant gesture] Yes! Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding. Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials? [opens album] [looking at Angela] While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. [Angela smiles] I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. [Andy moves his head into Dwight's view] Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night. While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands. OK. Pay him whatever he wants. Okay. Where is my translator? There he is. Be good. Meaning what? [on airplane] Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa. Handed to me as I sat down. This was my hot towel. It is still wet. Take a sip of that. [hands Andy his mimosa] That good? Don't drink all of it. Give some to Oscar. Yes... Get back, get back. Come on, get back to the slums. [whispers] Andy brought one too. Alright. Very cool. Okay. Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those. Wow! Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you! Oh, the Huntsman is good. Guys, she's in there. Let's do this. She's foreign. I am-- Oh, thank you. Thank you? Everyone is going to end up dying someday. And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with. How do you even know they're gay? Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there. [turns to bartender] Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s'ill vous plait. [to Oscar] Bad decision in a glass. I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse. Don't do this. [watches Andy take drinks to the other table] What? Uh, sorry... what? Is he your boyfriend or something? Dude, leave us alone alright? What are you doing? If you don't mind me asking--- Okay. Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time. How could anyone stand that woman? What do you see in her? Wh -- what do you see in Angela? I want to know. You haven't had sex? Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or? Andy, something is wrong with that woman. I'd like to know. You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her. Do it! It's a--- Call her! [Andy holds up phone] Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. [giggling] Andy, don't call her! [on phone] Hello? Hello? What? Are you drunk? I know who this is! [over phone] Who is that monkey? Are you drunk? We will discuss this later. What? It's totally unrealistic. There are no lines in the parking lot. Hey. Yeah, it was. Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up. I can't believe we called her up. [both laugh] I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night. You--- you call--- you called her. Alright. Okay. Yes. Mmm... What is first base with Angela? I had a good time too. Thank you. No. Bro hug? [Oscar shakes head... then sticks his hand out and Andy shakes it] Back to basics. I like it. [pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this? Disgusting. Yeah, I am. Wait, how do you know that? I didn't tell you that. That's really not cool. Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam? the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance. By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter. Sincerely, disappointed." Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one? Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end. Yeah, do tell. Mmhmm. Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on. Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan? This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such. Honey, say something! ...I'll consider it. There's a hose out back. Yes it does! Cow, goat or sheep. It's beautiful. So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here. [to minister] Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and- He doesn't understand a word you're saying. My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years! No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me. [kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue. Stupid. Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb. Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France. I'm all right. I'm all right. Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket] [Andy playing the sitar] Hey. Do you take requests? As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will. They have to do it voluntarily. They have to h*t rock bottom. So I think I know what I need to do at this point. I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom. Um... I think I can do it. I did it with Jan. I think I'd like to go home now. So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more... [getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope. Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office] There you go. When? You know this can't go on. We have to put an end to this. Come on. [Dwight and Jim follow into Michael's office] Thanks. [to Andy] Andy? Walk with me. Ohh, I do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear... Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day. Which will be fine. I am off! Thank you! [gets into his car] [through the car window] Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so... [rolls down car window] Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know. All right. See you later. [backs out of the parking space] Ahh. Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit... We can talk right here. We're not listening. Let's go to the conference room. What have you heard? That doesn't sound like me. Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake... A little bit. I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he k*lled sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again. Michael. [quietly] Let me think about it... I, um... there... [Andy looks over to see everyone watching them] Standard, you know? Nothing fancy. I said nothing fancy. I love you. Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together. Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong. You okay, man? You are welcome. Andy. Oh good. She broke up with you. Uh, no way. I am not giving up. No I don't. [angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me. Will never be her name. Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit? And I'm telling you that I will never back down. Oh really? How are you gonna do that? That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest. Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela. Hey. It is my business when it happens at work. Yes! Outside of work. None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what w*apon? That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands. I call loser! I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location. Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey! Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah! Never! [hits Andy's car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man! You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] "La la la la la la la la la la!" What does that mean? You can't even protect her! Andy, are you all right? Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain] I sa- [Andy honks his horn] Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch! What? She's sleeping with you? She said she was only sleeping with me. [picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can] Oh, I do. Some actress, whether shes hot. [muted] Mmhmm. [shrugs] Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting. Im not a shark. What-- Oh! Here's a door. Check that one out. How's the handle? Ah! My hand! That's hot! Have you ever seen a burn victim? What is that? What is that? What in the name of God is going on?! Ahhhh!!! [Oscar's leg crashes through the ceiling] Leave me al-- Andy. Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah... Okay! Hey, Stanley. Okay, look. David, this is why we have training. We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person. He's not saying what he needs to say. I mean, they just need to communicate, you know? If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then-- Hmm. Gimme a break. [to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast. So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance? Nope. His name is Michael. [Michael makes the da dum ksch on the drumset again] Lilly no. Lilly! Lilly please! Lilly STOP! I don't care how much time we have left. I don't care what my friends say! And I don't care what your mom thinks! Frankly I'm pretty sure she's not makin any sense. Please. Move back to my apartment. [Andy's crying, "I'm All Out of Love" starts playing] Lilly. I'm not giving up. I'm not giving up. Lilly... Lilly! Push the reverse button! Reverse the button! When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous] [laughs] You don't have to lie. Through here. She's out of your league Andy. Sexually? This conversation is over. [sighs] I can't accept these prices, Stanley. They just cut our budget. Four Splenda. Are you crazy? Are you out of your damn mind? We're not friends. I didn't think about it. You really like her, huh? I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother. No, it could go straight to our business address. Actually, I, I don't have a boyfriend. [stammers] Really? Is that... wow, that's so weird. This gal, she's really into you? All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her. Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim? Thanks for walking me out. You must be freezing. Oh, no, it's okay. This is my car. What's a "Nard-Dog"? [Andy leans in to kiss her] Whoa. What the hell? I just got out of a relationship too. It's really hard. No, I, I don't think so. [chuckles] Okay. Thank you. [as Julia is pulling out] Sorry I tried to kiss y... No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon. I think I should call her. Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today? But I do like her just the way she is. What are you doing? [to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know. You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out. Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker. Well guys with girlfriends don't. No, stop it. Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her. Nice. [Both laugh] Boobs. [Lynn blushes] This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange [points to Andy] Five years old? I'm gonna walk away. Ok. Nice meeting everyone. I'll see you in a couple of weeks. I have a job. Okay. Hey. You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world. [eats some spaghetti] Oh God! Blech! Phyllis! Oh! Hey. What is this about? Oh. Me too, me too. Is this wine? I already have wine. I'm starting my own paper company. Yeah. Yeah. In all climates. It's going to be worldwide. And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me. That's where you come in. [yelling from Parking lot] Alright then everybody, I'm outta here! And just like that. As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building] Andy He's gone. Oh, man! Hold it. Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings] Way to go. Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. [Andy raises hand] Yeah. Alright. You a soccer fan? Well, that makes two of us. Yeah. I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals. Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man. We can do this. Yep. Yep. That's Pele. I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office. Sounds fun. You know, Michael? You want to succeed? You got to apply the same- [Michael slams door] I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet. Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together. Erin [eerie voice] Erin... Oops! Hey buddy, what are you up to? Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis. Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us? And I, yours. So I will cede her to you. No no no. Thank you. Wow! Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it. In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasendDwight and Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really [flushing] Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important. Cherry Pie, Warrant. No! Really? Enter Sandman, Metallica. Really? Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love. I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?' I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost? I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to. Michael. I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake. Am I going down a road? It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this. Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said- -I just don't know if I can do it. It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy. [both laugh] You know that I was doin' this. I got h*t in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you? [Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call. Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck! Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back. Forget it. Are you saying you invented paper? Oh, God. Hey. Hello. Andy, I think Jim is messing with you. Okay. Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together. And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will. I don't want to hear excuses. I want to see improvements. This is unacceptable. Why are you telling me this? Is this something you really want to have said? No, you lost those clients. I don't think so. Okay, what are you still doing at your desk? Did you even read the memo? No, you idiot. There is a code embedded in the memo. Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto. Excellent question. What'd you have, Stanley? Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon? And me. Yes I do. I have a very difficult decision to make. It's like last week I was at the video store. Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice? It is what you would call a classic difficult decision. Casual Fridays are cancelled. [everyone protests] Let's just not do it anymore. I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo. Andy's afwaid? No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco. Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster. No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It's like children singing Christmas carols. I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude. Are those staples? No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music] Stop squirming. You wanted to do this. Just be brave. I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up. Gay ear? Are you 12 years old? Look, I'm gonna count to 3. No. I'm gonna count to 3. Andy, that was just the ice. Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row! Why? I don't understand. Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it. I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team. Sly dog. Newspapers for sale! These are expensive Ray-Bans, jackass. Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on! I could've gotten that, idiot! [playing volleyball] h*t it Andy! Let's do this. Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four? Oh. No. You have to wipe the jelly off your hands first. Sticky. [all turn when they hear Andy singing in the break room] [singing to the tune of Beethoven's 5th] Vending machine. Vending machine. I want a treat. Something to eat. I want a treat. A little sweet. But not too sweet. What do I eat? Vending machine. Tell me what to eat now. You really think you can replicate the chemistry that you and I have... with this guy? 00. You are so talented. [enters office, somersaults onto couch, kicks over painting and lamp] Parkour!Dwight & [rush into office, Andy climbs on reception desk, Dwight holds video camera] [stands on his hands kicking open bathroom doors as Andy films, Meredith is seen applying deodorant in women's bathroom]Dwight & Andy! Leapfrog! [Andy leapfrogs Dwight] Yeah! [Dwight jumps on Andy's back, riding him like a horse] Parkour! Parkour! [standing on tractor trailer with Dwight and Andy, looking down] Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time. [in unison] Yeah! Gainer! Woohoo! Let's do it! [look down, appearing shocked and concerned] She's gonna hate being a mom. [looks at Andy and giggles] [still giggling] Tea. You would. [sarcastically] Oh, I bet you like it. Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts? Because you're gay. [serious] Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school? This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. [chuckles nervously] Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. [long pause] But it makes you wonder. [nodding] I did. Yes. What? Are you attracted to other men? [stares at Andy incredulously] If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you? [mouth full of cake] Me too! Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though. Yep. Are you... interested in her guy friends? Okay. Really. Well you gotta figure this out. Yeah! You gotta have sex with a woman. And a man. And then compare. Yep. On what? I heard that from... Andy. [sighs in unison] Yes. We have a right to know. Here's the deal. I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time. That came out wrong. It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim. [staring into the conference room] How are your sales doin'? Again with the cousin. [in the cheese cart] Be my eyes. What have we here? Hey, we're gonna do this... Cheese platter? My plan-- a man-- panama. This is how you make this important decision? It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning! I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace. And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara. Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke. People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. [Angela beeps her car horn.] It's the hair-- [beeps again.] Ok. Ok. I'm going. [long beep] God. This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver. Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back. Oh, no. Just an individual. That man over there. Um... also-- She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin. Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio. Yes! That sounds epic. Can we bring anything? Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo! No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down. [everyone is dancing] Go Meredith. Nice moves. Lame! What else you got, Andy? What else you got? It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. [knocks on Pam's door] Pam? [knocks again] What? Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours. Now you sound like Kermit. Nope. I, like you, have never been here before. Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before. My job? My job is to get married in the morning. That's my job. Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so-- [Pam swerves the car back and forth] Ow, ow! Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night? Are you in a lot of pain? People say you cry all the time. Crotch injuries are the worst. You don't need to tell me. Is there still something there? It didn't get torn off? If you want to sit on this-- [hands Andy her wrap] I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged penis. Make it softer. Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can't just go right to the selling, you need "small talk." What topics can you use for small talk? Mmhm. Mmhm. Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks. Mmhm. No Dwight, not everything is a thr*at. There is no such things as monsters. Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance. I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance. What? What? So he won't get caught! It's Grotti. He's following up. Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or? Okay, I'm calling the police. All right. That's an exaggeration. What am I supposed to do here? No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat. I don't know, I don't know about that. Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent. Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous. Hold on, hold on! Just- All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone. We'll be right beside you. [Andy dressed as a mechanic, Cornell hat on] What are you wearing? Who's Pat? Do you know how to use it? Let's go, come on. [whispers] God! [Andy is playing with the tire iron] Take that thing off the table! Please! Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel. Hi. Angelo Grotti. That's not true. I don't really know what that is. Look closely Michael. I feel there's a plan here for you. [approaches with child] Excuse me. Sorry to bother you. Are you a mechanic? My battery is dead, I've got my kid, can you please help? Come on! Lady in distress? Go! Go! Put it down. He seems bad at this. What?!? Now if you could just sign this letter of intent, I'll bring this back to my boss, and we can get this in motion. [Andy clears throat loudly] You okay, Pat? Aren't you a mechanic? Why wouldn't you put oil in the car? Don't do it! Don't. It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour. We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault. Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job. Not the living in fear, that's new. Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy. Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy? Yeah... What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia! No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works. It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really. But Grotti acts like he's mafia though. I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk. Doubt it. [disconnects call]Dwight and What a tool. [Dwight and Andy exchange looks] What? You successfully backed down the mob! Andy, can I talk to you for a second? [holding up a sign that reads, "Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office"] I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think? Really? I was gonna go with this one. [Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog... what was that all about? What were you talking about in there? [in the conference room leading a meeting] Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities. Yes! That's what I'm talking about. Here we are outside- - the Wilkes-Barre Industrial Park. The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them. Here it is. [Andy is still singing] Suite 401. I know. Now you don't have to. Must be nice to have company on these cold calls. [Andy shakes his head 'no'] Oh. No, no. [laughing] We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together. Well that sounds like a really nice deal. And I must say, that since we are a family business it is nice to see that you are, too. It's ok. Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes. You were way meaner to me than I was to you. You blew the sale, you idiot. Ok. Well, you two are quite the salesmen and a very cute couple. Well, you know. He loves to eat. I love to watch him dance. Yes. Mmm-hmm. Oh. I know the best teacher. Her name is Miss Janet. Yeah! No. We are not done here. This- That's great! Yeah, well, that'll happen. Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting. We'll stay late. Yeah, I guess. If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss. Yeah. Way too much. I mean, what the hell was that? When you cried? You're fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes? Hmm. Well, are you dating anyone? Ah. Ah. No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you. This is really nice Dwight, thanks. Why did I get in the car? I could of struggled. I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it. Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it. Wow-- I will. [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face] Let me get that door for you-- [runs to open door] There you go! Oh... goodness... thanks. You know, here's a healthy fitness tip. If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees. Observe. [walks towards desk] Right? Yeah, feel free to use that. Anytime. Okay. [straightens Andy's tie] And that needs to be straight as an arrow. Thank you very much for that. [pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat. Allow me. You know what? I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse. No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away] Do I really want to go snowboarding? No. But I would like to if I wanted to. Oh... no... really? There is no book. There's only a survival guide. That was a bunt. Hey, hey, hey-- relax I got it covered. No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist. [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door] Stop. What's going on? Alright, move it. Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time. Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha-- [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card. But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy. You did? That sounds like it was hilarious. Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer] [in lunch room with several coworkers] Guys, what if this is our last day at work? What if we never see each other ever again? [Andy scoffs and looks over at Erin, Erin looks sad] OK, use your imaginations. Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal. How about you? I'll go. [stands up, begins speaking with a southern accent] My name is Deborah U. Tante. Deb for short. I do not. Oooo, now do the Swedish chef. I will poison your food. Very good, very good. Now, no one was there in the wine cellar. [Creed gets in his car and drives away] Hello. Sounds like a plan, Sugar. Nice. Frankly, I'm not surprised. A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns. I haven't seen it. [accent] Of course, Nathaniel. [accent] Where are you taking me? [accent] Savannah? That's a far way from Scranton. No. [laughs] Did you? There has been a lot of m*rder and a lot of intrigue. My little heart can barely take it no more. [regular voice] Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time. OK, everybody just calm down. Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something] Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild. Michael, I hated the twirl. Calves. Calves all the way. [in the limo with Dwight, Andy and Oscar] I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here. Word. Nah. Might as well do it now. I'll ask you a question. No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.' [they all laugh] I won't say that. I'll something like that. Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So - Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. [finding a seat] Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple. Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you. These questions are bush league. You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. [points to Oscar's heart] Don't be a wuss. Yeah, Have a seat. Okay, right there is the problem. There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk. I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard] Can you read that back to me? Mmm-hmm. Okay. You are also on record as saying "wittle-ittle," "footy-wutties," "nummies," "jammies," "make boom-boom," "widiculous," and "wode iwand." You can't be a baby in the office. It makes me look like I hire babies. Okay, who said that? [Elvis voice] Well, thank you... thank you a lot. And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops. [as Elvis] You're welcome, baby. Wait, are you the patient or the doctor? Wow, what do you put our chances at? Hmm, sounds risky. Don't worry. There is a surefire cure. Employee of the Month. Every awesome place I've worked has had one. Wow, that's not such a bad idea. Anything else? It would look good, on my mantle. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome. I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes. And the winner is, employee number nine. And that is? Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it. Okay? This was your idea anyway. Thank you. No, wait, come on. I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month. Everyone. What psycho would send that as a gift? [Kelly hugs Erin] Never mind, I shouldn't have said that. It stings a lot. I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts. So far no one will admit to it. Is it you? [Andy stage face, eyes pop, big mouth smile, Erin laughs] Seriously? What? Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company! All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael. [on microphone] Andy had Erin. [gestures the YMCA dance] Mmm, mm mm mm. [Dwight smirks, leaves] It was a little much Andy. What were you thinking? [Andy freezes] Twelve drummers drumming. [marching drum band lines up to perform, Andy steps out with cymbals] Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh? Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys. Saber. Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sob-ray. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay. Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sabre. [music stops] I don't know, I don't know. Well, I saw them in there. I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with. It'll be ok. No, you? Nothing. It's wide open. Okay. Oh, that's Mrs. Bennett, sweetheart. My husband and I are divorced, but I kept the "Mrs." just to piss off the new wife. Well, let's take a gander around this place. They love a good crotch. You should take that as a compliment! Two guys doing one job? We gotta do something about that! What, no candy? Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem "too eager," so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit. I'm Jolene Bennett, Jo for short. I'm a breast cancer survivor, close, personal friends with Nancy Pelosi, and Truman Capote and I slept with three of the same guys. When I was a little girl, I was terrified to fly, and now I have my own pilot's license. I am CEO of Sabre International, and I sell the best damn printers and all-in-one machines Korea can make. Pleased to meet you. Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three! Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up! [opening card] Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog! You named them? Uh, yeah I do remember. [reading card] Aw, they love each other. Wow, it smells really good too. Andy, whoa! Thank you very much! I did. Oh! You scared me! I didn't see you. And you were there all along. [takes papers out of copy machine] Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go. Bye, Andy. [kisses his cheek] No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her. [cell phone rings] Oh, I gotta take this. Yep. Uh, finish walking my dogs for me. And don't ride 'em. Lotta people try to ride 'em. You don't even like us as friends? What are we, five? [entering with Erin] Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy? Who? I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight. Not until midnight. I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr. The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body. I will allow that. [ as Pam shakes her head] Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that. [as Pam gives the thumbs up] That sounds good! Do you need some music, or...? Okay. Ooh, someone's freakin'. That kid's going to have a lot of hair. She hasn't popped yet. What? God damn it. She was supposed to come out yesterday. There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together, and I made a family. Andrew, what about you? Torn scrotum. Still on the mend, so not good timing. Yes. This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you... Yes, Andy? Okay, please hurry. Okay, good. It's busy. Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit? [tearing up] You can't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything wrong. I've been having a tough day today. You read the fax. Oh, my God. That's amazing. Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner. Yes. Do you have a day in mind? Everyday is fine. Or... Thursday? Hey! When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in! Andy go braugh to you! Nice kilt! Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt. [Turns off Dwight's music] Whether it's this time or next time. Well... [Jo closes door on her] Yes? Oh! You're sick! [Andy coughs] Dangit! That's exactly why I sent that receptionist home. Get everybody sick in the office. We don't need any heroes here honey. It's time for you to get on home now. [Opens door, surprised] Oh! Andy! I'm in my jammy-jams! Your hand's cold. Yeah, have some more blanket. What's up? You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid. He's my foster brother. Cold hands. [Takes spot next to Erin on love seat] Ooh! [Erin giggles] None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen. Nice skirt. I look forward to that too. Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here. I'm so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.] No sales topic per se. Michael - [Michael signs] Great. There's other pencil's in this office. About time. 'Now that's Italian!'] Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing [cut to scenes of chaos as everyone argues] Some people shouldn't be in this business. Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads. [mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower. Lower. I think you're remembering that wrong? Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad? I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff. Okay, fine. Cash it is. really sorry. Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only [they both cheer and high-five] [strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy's back] Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What? I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in. Good one. [on phone] Yes! Yes! I would love to! I did not see this coming. Sure, if you are. Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off. Whoa. Exactly. Quiet. Yes? Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time. Ok, yes. Sure. No, I got that. I am in. What is happening? One second. I know, but you wanted the big thing. Oh I know. 'Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.' Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart. Hey, you two having fun? No. What? Okay. Hi. Do what? [Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that? What we said to do. I was flirting with a man. The movies. I don't know. Hoop it up, right. This is not what I want my relationship to look like. [holding photo strip of he and Erin fighting] [over PA] Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you. [laughs] You love drama. [Kevin's voice] Oscar, Toby said he left my Girl Scout cookies on my chair. Have you seen them? Wait I'm sitting on them. [all laugh] This is my favorite day. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Hello, Pam. A one-on-one lunch with Erin? She's kind of a rube. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch. We're both girls. Who cares? Lunch was fine. I don't know. It was lunch, Andy. Ok. You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so.. No. No. No. Stop talking. Oh God. I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not? "C" is for suspension. Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap. You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret. Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein? How long were you guys together? A year? You were together for a year? I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok? "Hey! Hey Scott!" Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day. Andy? Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far. Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out. Oh! Oh, no. Nine dates. I said it on the second date. And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves] My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems. There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right? That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves. I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah. [puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good. You didn't feel like he was hiding something? Yeah. Close the door. Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things. It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was "Andy," "Problem," "Eliminate," something. I don't know what it meant. Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that. Psst... [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down] I know, it's just, I'm scared... It's bad. Still no plan. It's getting bigger. I can videotape it. [to camera] There it is. [to Pam on floor] Nice effort. You haven't even introduced yourself. You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird. Higher. [motions with hand to go up more] One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher] This... [removes camera headset] Eughh. [looks disgusted] So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight? I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer. On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. dr*gs. They spit. Real sports with Bryant Gumble. You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson. My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage. Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy. Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him. I am Beyonce always. Yes, I am. I would love that. I have work to do. Let's go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her. All right, Andy, please. Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him. Right there. The coach! Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base? All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please? I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it. You have no idea what you're talking about. You don't. No, no. You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, "Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?" "High-five, Donna." "Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?" "Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit." Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary. I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera] Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't. Yeah, right. You must be rootin' for the other guys. [whispers] Okay. Let's go. Do I know you? Are you somebody's... parents? Oh, are you guys... Kenny's dads? Okay. Okay. Let's go! Whoa! Hey, I'm really sorry, I'm just trying to... focus here on the game. Of course. Okay? I gotta... get back to this. All right. No, no, no. I'm good. Oh, my God. Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane. Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything. [quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae. If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets. Is there something that you would like to say to me? About talking to the press? Mmhmm. I don't believe you. That's a little much. All right, all right, all right. Okay, I believe you, I believe you. What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it. [nods at Andy] Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy. I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it. Thank you so much for that. I saw all your hard drives, and guess what? [gestures to Ryan] You're not a photographer. [gestures to Kelly] And you definitely can't fit into a size two. Darryl, man, you're on Facebook. Why you been telling people you're not on Facebook? People want to be your friend, man! All right? And you. [points to Andy] This guy, you're the one who told the press. You wrote an e-mail to the editor. I saw it, and I also saw a QuickTime movie of your little printer f*re test on your hard drive. This guy's the snitch, he's the snitch. So that's it, check it out. [gives the finger] Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace. [points to the ceiling] You deserve it. [offscreen] No, it does not! Andy? I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
