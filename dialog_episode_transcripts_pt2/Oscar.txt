Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right? [looks at Oscar] What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that? Angela? Ok, I have an announcement. I can also take 3 people. Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground? Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat. On your left! So we've got what, another 20 minutes? Yes, Michael, they do. Yes, sir. Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake. Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland. Really? Alright who wants to party? Oscar, talk to him. You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza? We think it's a straight forward kidnapping. Why can't you guys do it? I stole it! No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word. I can't believe he has a second job. Hey, hey, hey. Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems? Exactly. I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY! I didn't say it, I declared it. Still, that's not anything. Yeah, tell me about it. You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine. Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic. I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together. I got game. Mm-hm. That is so cool how you have my name at the top. Right. Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background] Angela. No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this. We will find another way, we'll ask power-point. You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this. No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half. We really did. It was fun. [on phone] Michael, how did this happen? Where did all your money go? I don't, I don't get this. I really don't. I don't know how you could be so irresponsible. I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really. I don't know what more to say. [on phone] Yeah, what? [on phone] Okay, where did he go? [on phone] Well, is he coming right back? Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food. In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food. I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man. [makes squinty face] Oscar, did you bring it? Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware. Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club. We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way. Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful. There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed. It's very exclusive. I think I cut my penis on the lid! [joins them at the table] Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit. It just- [Kevin banging and shaking the snack machine] To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh... Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer. Very brave choice also, I thought. [Irish accent] Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us. Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I. Of course I read it. [flashback to Oscar's birthday, hiding in the break room] Happy Birthday! You know, try sending them another invoice. Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way? Right? I was just thinking... I took an extra sh*t of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die. Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care. Yeah. [Jim enters room] Nature. We got our spaces back. I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness. Elliot. [on phone] Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. [to office co-workers] Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. [lowers voice] He said it should just be under an hour, so... [everyone groans] we did it. Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow. [notices cleaning crew coming up to the gate] Cleaning people. Oscar. [everyone starts to walk outside] OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us. I... just... if they speak Spanish. Ohh... I love it more! No, okay... I've had enough of you. Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited! This is all we need. Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company... I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin. Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist. Mm-hmm. When you get a loan, you don't have to use it for exactly what you say you're gonna, right? No, but, I mean, once the bank gives you the money it is your money. You can use it for whatever you want, right? No, Kevin that would be fraud. Let's say you tell the bank that you're going to open up an ice cream store but instead you buy an ice cream cart? Technically you are still selling ice cream. Gambling debts? What? [outside the office with a cart, ringing a bell] Ice cream! Goooood ice cream! Oscar. No, I decided I would pay off my debts by selling ice cream. I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today. Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday. [forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks] Oh, thanks. I should check that out. Actually, I'm a lesbian. I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke. There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women. Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just-- I knew that. OK, bye. Oh, she's very beautiful. So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number. Damn it. Come on. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life. I haven't had a very hard life. Hey, hey! How do you know Michael Clump? How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people. Ahaha, Yep! [Dwight looks down depressingly and rubs his new goatee] Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call. I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so... [speakerphone] Hi everyone! No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies. It's part of the ethics thing. I'll drop an ethics b*mb on you. Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom! Anybody? This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions. Stanley? Oscar, come on. Yeah, [interrupting gibberish]. Come on, anybody. Let it fly. I know, Kevin. And this is way worse than the stroller she came with. I'm done. Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000. Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector. How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk. Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days. Thank you Michael, thanks, thanks everybody. I'd like to auction off a weekend at my place in Martha's Vineyard. Hey, hey! ... Yeah. Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you [points at Jim] if you hadn't forgotten French. Where is my numbers man? That's really good. [offers mimosa to Oscar] [whisper] Hey... guys, check it out. My own personal DVD player and 20 movies. Shhhh! Keep it down. [going up escalator in the hotel] This is nice. This is nice. Move in here. Very sweet... ah. Engaging wings [imitates mechanical sound] Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez. Works in accounting. This is uh, concierge Marie... And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night--- Alright, I've scoped out the joint. Those two dudes are as good as naked. You'll thank me when they spank thee. Gentleman. [walks away] Unbelievable! Unbelievable. Anything. You can ask me anything. I'm your wingman. Right-o. What? What do I see in Angela? I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle. She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that. And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have sex with her. No. Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for. What is wrong with her? I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her? What is wrong with you? That was fun last night. You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada. You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards. [Oscar laughs] Totally. [continues laughing] What--- Who? We called Angela? That was real?! I thought I dreamed that. Oh, God! Oh, God! So bad! Oh man, she is so pissed. [sitting down by Oscar] She's taking us back to first base. I get to kiss her forehead. [looks at Oscar] I had a good time hanging out this weekend. You up for a chest bump? Definitely we should. That is just obnoxious. Yeah. Wait, what, the mess or the note? Mmm... okay. Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old. Yes. There's the x-a*...icks. Mmhmm, okay. Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five. Ho-oh! Yeah. I'll be six. So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus. [whistles poorly] Whoo. No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better? [over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good... Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands. The b*lls on you, man. Well that never happened. I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair? [through the laughter] Oh, is somebody making fun of me? I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly. I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing. Do I know what? Yeah, know what? Right. Because that is how my mind works. I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less. So what's it gonna be? Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me. Hey. What? Sorry. Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly. [mimicking] What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it-- Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church? I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number. Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number. [to Dwight] Are you still having intercourse with her? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes'] Did you ever have intercourse in this office? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes'] Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... [Angela puts headphones on; Kevin looks at Oscar] What? How about, "I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?" I knew something bad was gonna happen today. Fine! Where are you? Why isn't Dwight turning around? Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture. [surprised] Wait, what? This is ridiculous. Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can... Oscar! Pull me up! What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other... Si senor. [giggling] Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God... Pow pow pow... [hands making g*n impression, sporadic clapping] [in the lunch room, with a sock puppet] He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order. [giggles] I'm almost done. Are you alright? Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela? [Angela raises her hand] Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are... [Stanley is laughing] Oscar, you're gay. Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking. ... Okay, let's go. It... yeah. For a cat? I could get you a kid for that. I have something better than a picture. Come on. I can do this. Why would we- [cats meowing from Angela's computer, sounds like crying] Is that what I think it is? [Kevin and Oscar get up and go to Angela's computer] [gasps] [cats meowing in background][on Nanny-Cam] Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now. This is getting weird. [shivers] [meowing noises] Has this been on the entire time? [sigh of relief] Well, sorry I'm late. [clears throat, coughs, pulls hairball out of her mouth] Take a nap! Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex. [Kelly looks hurt] Okay, sorry, let's, who else? Oscar. Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest. Nobody asked, Bob! Oh God, what did you do? I mean, not that I approve of any of it but... Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story. Really sad. My worst breakup was actually two breakups. Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me. No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio. John Mark and John David. Alright who's next? Where's Andy? What? Is somebody after you? Oh, not likely. 3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up. Hey, if anybody wants to go... You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit. Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a h*t is ten percent of our Blue Cross account? Yeah? Yeah. Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't f*re all of us, right? No, they can't. Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about. May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight. Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that. Okay, so. I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken! So I have to take the normal door. You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it. [feeding coins into a vent] I think it's 75 cents. I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it b*at me like that wireless router did. [bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it] I made it sterile. I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me. No, no no. Okay. Okay, hey, you already have the job. You don't have to convince me. I think he's singing. ... and I feel free! Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the? Hey dude, you know what a "rundown" is? "Uh, can you get this rundown for me?" [impersonating Charles] "This rundown better be really good"? Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients. No. I can't. It was like, hours ago. Oscar, what were you going to say? When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately. Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink. Urine. It was urine. I could loan you a pair of socks. No, they're clean. I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later. A bunch of prudes. You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals, but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes? [pulls down dress, office gasps] Is that how it goes? Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you. I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see. Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry. Ashley! You made it! Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that? Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug] Because if we don't play, then the other team wins. Yeah. This looks ok. [to Oscar, motioning to male intern and female intern] Think she did him? [to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay? And? Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay? [scoffs and chuckles] No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, [long pause] I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like. Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive? It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario. Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay. If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward? Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit. [knock at Michael's Office door] Yeah? Yes, Oscar come on in. Close the door if you would. Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me. I'm going in for a procedure today. Yeah, it's routine. I'm just a little bit scared. It is a colonoscopy. In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? [Oscar looks irritated and frustrated] Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry? My main concern, should I have a safe word? Can I also be a boss? Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults. But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises? Ooh, easy. That's not it at all. What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?! What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?! Totally! ...when he was telling us his dumbass plan. Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? [all say yes] Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do. Nope. I'm numbering the paper. Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table] That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces. What does a bean mean?! Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor. She thought I was your boyfriend. Oscar, it was an honest mistake. Yes. It's a good idea. [sees Kevin's toupee] Oh my God. Yes. I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee. Who would want it? I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space. All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation. He did talk about a f*re in the warehouse... and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer. Uhh. All right, who else is here? [looks around] [groans] Oh no. Fabulous. It's John Gotti, you idiot! Yeah. It's pretty close. Hello? Oscar! Uh, what is going on? Hey Oscar. It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon. Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us. If the salad is on top, I send it back. I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone. Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you. Oh you don't know about jail? Oh you would love jail. Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away? Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing? Very close. Yes. Yes! Thank you, welcome to my personal hell! Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for. Hey. [walks up to Oscar and hands him a report to sign] [in a sing-songy voice] Pam, how's your day going? Oh, well, thanks Oscar. I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom? Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection. I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story. Alright. Just, write it down, please. Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer. [watching Angela eat something] Enjoying your nut? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this. Open QuickTime. Here they come. [everyone reacts to seeing Michael fall in] Boom! Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it. [as Jim enters the kitchen] Hey, what's up lifeguard? What's going on in here? My money's on Pam. Michael could win. Oh, the Wall. Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs. Oh, that sounds awful. [looks at Oscar who is using his phone, grabs it] Well, well, well. What is this contraption, I do declare? I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin. Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone. And she might be a m*rder. What does that mean? [accent] Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son? This here's Savannah. Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here. I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin. Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the b*llet points. Well, could you condense it please? It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows. [others start raising their hands to be picked] Mmm... whoa. I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy. Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line. I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one. [from behind the door] Is there internet? Tell them what you told me. This is genius. Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all - It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them. That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better. O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing? Wow, man. That - That was embarrassing. For me, too. You embarrassed me. Hey buddy, so every- Huh? What? It is time to unveil the tree. Hey Santa! You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box! Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny. [she walks over to see Oscar at the window looking down on man catching a football in parking lot] I think my water just broke! Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted! Hey. Uh, Matt is on a delivery. Just leave it here, I'll take it. Matt's a pretty good-looking dude, don't you think? Have you talked to him? Matt? Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right? Nice to meet you Oscar. It's Matt. [clapping] I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you? [points to Oscar] Impossible. He opened it like an ape. [Pam and Oscar are trying to repack cardboard box] Yep, yep. Yep. We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks. La la la, hello Oscar! What are you reading? Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again. Why, is there an untapped gay market? ...Where did you get that information. Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you. Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital? You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital? Thank you! Thank you! You know it doesn't have to be an invention. Oscar, h*m* accountant. Oh I'm in. Drinks are on me! Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So... [Jim gestures for her to continue] Alright, alright. [chanting continues] One more, one more! [cheers and applause] Wow. [applause] Hey, Oscar. You're here early. No, you don't. I don't know. I'm free. If you hear of anything going on, let me know. Yeah. Hey, what's up? Thanks, it's cool. So... Has that ever happened? Ever? You want me to invite Matt? Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me. Happy hour. My pleasure. All right. My brother, good head, bad heart. Good head, bad heart. Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right? Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common. Hey, what's up? Anyone up for some hoops? Let's do it. This is awesome! Good work, buddy. That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please. Well, I know. [stammers] Just want... I mean... [chuckles] It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened. But you're an accountant too. La telefona. El telefono. Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific. [clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el! I think we could. [Donna giggles] Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes. It is totally insane. Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective. Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off. Mm. Curve the b*llet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted. Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo! I'm an awful guy! Ooh! Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site. Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
