Hey! How are you Tom. Nice to see you. That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend? That, is awesome! I think this is better. Okay, okay. Nice to see you again, Pam. Clever, Mike. That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually. Hey, just having fun Jimmy. That must be really fun for you and Marci huh? And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me try to get on the Mets. Guys, what is going on?! [Pete and Tom burst out in laughter] Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'. Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and-- They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would k*ll with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom. Smoking. Um, yeah. You look great.
