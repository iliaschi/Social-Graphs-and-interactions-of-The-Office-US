[on phone] Please don't pick up, please don't pick up, please don't pick up. Haaank. Is that you? Still haven't left the house yet, huh? Good. Please hurry. Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don't, I disagree, I say... let's hear it for the boys. You might take something. And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife. Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads. Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. [Hank takes some jellybeans from Pam's jar] Yeah, take as many as you want. Yes. Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand- Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs. It is, yes. What? Oh, there we go. Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party. So, the copier. All right, yes. Well, what should I do? [ccming to] Oh my God, how long was I out? [Michael looks over where Blood Girl was and sees Hank] Hey Hank, You ready? not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank... Hank? You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you? Hank, please escort Charles from the building. I'm about to buy this building, you know.
