Hi, can I help you? Uh-huh. [comes out of office] Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner. [shakes Charles' hand] At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up. [leads round of applause] Here he is. Surprise! [unveils bagels sitting on table] As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles. Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know. I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him. Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh. All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department. This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that. There you go! Where's the other? Hey! Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. [claps] Oh! Well... Above and beyond. That's true. No. Absolutely not. Do you have specifics? Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people. Well, why don't- Charles is going to tell you. Well, it's not official. Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance. Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. [starts round of applause] He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work. Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet. I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before. Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here? Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names. You're not from paper? Does David know this? Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point- And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear? Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back. Whatever David wants. Please hold. [to delivery men] Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here- Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast? I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad. For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical. Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may. Ok. Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved. Yes it is! No, it is not. Ok, so we're on the same page, great. Ok, Michael, what are you doing? No, seriously. I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad. [as Michael continues imitating Charles] Not a good idea, Michael. Michael, stop. Stop doing that. Stop it. You're going to get all of us in trouble. Ok. Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties. Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles. No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please. But it's cool, and it's- Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . . Yeah, why don't you do that? Yeah, here we go. Ok. What? You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story! Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace. [gets jacket] I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it. [pushes chair as he leaves] Hey. Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker. And a great number two for the office. Second-in-command to Michael. Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me. Assistant regional manager, yeah. No, not exactly. Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that. And I've never gone hang-gliding. And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington. Right, cause that's what we are talking about. You're 'I need you to' is my command. Yes I am. Hey hey... what's up Chuck? Hey. Nothing, just talking. I didn't... no. No I'm staying. 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school. We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians.. Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door] Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar. I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim. Yep! Yeah. He just loved having people, communicating all the time. He was like 'Come on in!" I did it. I learned everything about this machine. I know all the buttons, even the inside ones. I know all the error messages. I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors. Which feels... Yeah. Hmm? Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks... [to everyone] Well here we are... I would just like to... Thanks Jim. No. Okay, Okay, we don't have much time. Just act normal. Don't look at me people. Stop. Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me. Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height. Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future. Hello, I am your future. You're older, and you are very happy now. Because you went with Michael Scott. Right. So everybody come on down. Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright? Come on! Are you, are you doing your best here? Are you being the best that you can be? [Pam is thinking hard] Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot. Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me. Come on Phyllis. Here we go, here we go! Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on! I think maybe Hank should be here. Bye. Phones? [holding a crossword puzzle] Yes. Alright. Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton? Charles, where were you born? How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day. If you want to tell me - Oh no. I was just - ... Yes. [laughing at something on his computer] Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession. No way! I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner. Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me! Whoa! And he just goes, "Boom". [kicking motion] Goal! You know your soccer, man. I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona. From Argentina. I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but... Uh, no. Nope. Not really. It's 'cause I'm more of a player. Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say? I don't try and be anything that I'm not. Game on! Let's... eh... see ya. Hey, c'mon, guys. These are prime selling hours, you know. Oh, there he goes. Yikes. Aw, man. Oh! Goal! I will not be b*at. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee. Wag. Left. Striker! Alright! Let's do it. Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim. [Charles kicks, ball hits Phyllis in the nose] Phyllis, Phyllis. [muffled] No, I swallowed a crown. Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice. I'm sorry, Phyllis. You know what they say, keep your friends close. [pointing to office sign where "Dunder Mifflin" is listed right above "Michael Scott Pap"] Yes, I am, Charles. And... Yes? Charles, you wanted me? The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says "You wanted me" enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had. Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me? If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name. Please don't listen to my phone calls. Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space. Hi! [Awkward] Sure! When did you need that rundown by? Okay. Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is. Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with. I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now. Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ? Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard. No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should. Hey Charles. I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back. Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now. Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people. Personal shopper? Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building. There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for. Yeah sure. You want to look at it first? No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...? Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my att*ck readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence. You needed to speak to me? I prefer to stand. Less blood clots. Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard. Your concern is noted. Like a wolf. Thank you. Really? Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup! Dwight, run! You be cool. Just-what's going on? Mm-do... Dwight would not- I did, Michael. I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it. [an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me! Sorry. Sorry, no. It's, uh, it's a paper company now. It's not for the church. Oh, they're my client. [sighs] Shame, Jim. I expected more. What are we supposed to do? They keep undercutting us on price. Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys. I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie. I don't want to have said that. But I think it's important that you know it. It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired. Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports. Waste not, want not. David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace. Charles and I were waiting for you. A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure. Hmmm. [makes kissing, puckering sound] You know, I just want to address everyone first. Hello. Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business. And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback. I've been wondering that myself lately. We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured. Jim, can you come in with us please? Hmm. I find that extraordinarily surprising. We'll bring them both in. Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers? Stupid. Yeah, makes us look weak. Five minutes exactly. Sure thing. Now, this is the projection over three months? I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer. Oh, Man! If only Michael had children. That's how you really apply the pressure. You know what? Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me. I'm the man for this job. Charles, you got my back on this? [stutters] We'll have to talk-- Well, Jerry, the one who got away. May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company? Really? Please hold. [gets up and runs to kitchen] Charles. May I have your attention? The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke. You don't cr*ck a case. That has pejorative connotation. That's like calling a policeman a cop. You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty. Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit. Missing beets from all over the farm. No footprints. Inside job. Mose in socks. Boom, case closed. Done. I'm not-- I'm not following you. Wh-- Yeah. I want my old job back. I want my old parking space back. I want a Sebring. I am not f*ring Charles. He is very valuable. There are certain defining moments in a person's life. The day he is born. The day he grows hair. The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin. What have I learned from all of this? It is far too early to tell. I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it. I just want to enjoy it. "Holly, you and I are soup snakes." The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates. Hey Charles. Yeah. [playing volleyball, Scranton wins another game] Nicely done. We're still going to crush you though! [playing volleyball] Jim, come on! [Jim scores a point, Scranton cheers] Hey, easy, easy... No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second. All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player. Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go! [whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em. Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs. Okay. Fine.
