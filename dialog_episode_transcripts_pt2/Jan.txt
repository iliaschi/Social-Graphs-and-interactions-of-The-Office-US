[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach? Creed Bratton, 75 plus division. 82 November first. How much is the prize money? Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here? What? Look, no it was not... Darn it. No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity! I would prefer a public place. See you after work. Hi. In his office. You can go right in. Jan. So elephant in the room, I have your old job. Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities. Well... you look great. Scranton suits you. You were let go. Hey. [holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles? I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids. Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people. Well... What is that... word? So older people have just as many rights as younger people? Why don't you wanna go tonight? What... all your friends are gonna be there. It'll be fun. Just... Yeah. Thank you. Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser. Do I have your permission to invite Carol? So this one goes with my eyes and this one goes with your eyes. People have said I have very pretty eyes. I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine. We already have a sofa. So why do--- It... folds up. You've only seen it flat. I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost? No--- don't... that doesn't even mean anything. [on the phone] Michael, it's Ryan for you. We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration? Oh! Um, actually, I need the car. Okay, see you guys. [Sees Jan] Hey, how you doin'? Okay. How's yoga? Wh-Why not? Okay. So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt. Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying? Jan. Michael left. I don't know. I don't think so. Jan, he went running that way. [singing] Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back. Hey Jan. Not much, what's up with you? I'm out of answers Jan. I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you. I don't know that. I'll stay off the grid. Yeah it is, it is. I really messed up. That's really nice of you to say. Don't sell your implants please. That's nice though. [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that says "Good Morning"] Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back. Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? [Pam pushes a button the phone] Hi buddy. Yeah, I hate that. So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs. Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy. Well- Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor. Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win. Million dollars! Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized. Perfect crime. Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good. I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up. Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves. Oh. Very good. Well put. Uh, wh-why would she say that? Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, are you sure? How can you give up my diary like that? How'd you even find it? I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this. Fine. I love you. How can you do that to me? You can respond, just remember it's all going into the record. Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it. [Driving with Jan in the car] What do you want to do for dinner? Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap. Do you fast food? Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying] Hi. Come on in. Good to see you. We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine] It's really nice. Okay. Totally your call babe. Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door. Well, thats... Yep, never been used. No. So you have an office and a workspace? It's f*re. Bond. James Bond f*re. I am Bond f*re, James Bond f*re. Michael Scarn. [clicks tongue] Just like that. Just like that. Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color. Well, I- It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. [Lies down] No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry. Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool. If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away. Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see. Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies. I'll get it. Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers] Except for one flower, which is for... my flower. What am I supposed to do with this? Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it. 00? When in Rome. Whatever you say babe. What was that? Yeah that sounds good. You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him. [playing charades] No it's a... hump. There's a hump. Montana. All right, [rhythim clapping] my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn. What, no, I'm just making people laugh. Yes, I was watching Jim's face. And he was laughing. All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom- No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger. You're welcome. I don't like that story babe. Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible. Is there more wine in the kitchen? I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip. So you keep a very tidy house. No, yeah. What? Oh, are you joking? I've noticed how you look at him at the office. I'm sorry. [doorbell rings] What now? Hello. [whispering] Awesome. You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person. Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see? When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children. Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? [Jan walks away] Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg. I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover? You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that? Everybody enjoying their meal? Yeah? No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together. [to the guests] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good. BFD. I'm a screenwriter. NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS! MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES! OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER! You know you don't have to press charges, you could just try to be more quiet. Alright. [leads Michael away] Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? [Holly freezes; Michael laughs] No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back. It was great to see you, Jan. O-kay. Hello Jan. Yeah, Michael, I just uh... Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you! [Jan laughs] Are you nauseous? Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you? Good. Good. Thank God. Cause that's... Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy... Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very... ... proud. Um... You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to? Well, okay... So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so... You did? When we were going out? W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms. You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm? IHop. IHop. If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a sh*t at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count. I'm glad you told me. Um, I'll... I have to think about it. Hi, can I help you? Hi Jan. How's the candle game? Cool. Thank God they found her, too. Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet? [Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan. What do we have here? So this is Astird. Oh, OK. Why didn't you call me? I could have helped. Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways. No, I don't! Can I hold her? Assst... ...trid Levinson. Hi! Astrid, this is everybody, look. This is your family. You're going to know them for the rest of your life. [looking at Creed] Well, he may not be here. Say hello! OK, here we go. [lifting the car seat high above his head] Lion King! All right, how about some presents? I want to see some presents. [holding a memo pad] I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes. Oh! Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole b*mb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator] I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync. You know, that's all. Oh, great. I washed my lipstick. So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth. You gave birth in a tub? Um, so you're in the tub with everything? Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach. Me too. I could have helped. [smiling] Uh, yeah. No. I can imagine. Oh, I think she's on a sales call. Waaa! More paper! Waaa! [she cracks herself up but Jan is unimpressed] No, she's just on a coffee break. Yeah, that's a good one. We're taking a picture. She's nature's bounty. You don't flash around a newborn baby. Don't you know that? [sees Holly behind Jan] I was just going to... I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt. Sure you can't stay a little longer? All right. All right, everybody, we're leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving. Oh. I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk. Ah. Thanks, Dwight. OK? Wha - that's, I hate her. Wha - God! Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine. All right.
