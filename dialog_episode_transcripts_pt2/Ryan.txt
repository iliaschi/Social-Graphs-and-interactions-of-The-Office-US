My lord my liege. So I need a little treat for the g*ng. Something to win their affections back. Well, I ran down Meredith in my car. No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little cr*ck in her pelvis. But she will be up in... Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine. we are fine? [sigh] Right. Let's do some good. [sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back -- There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. [laughing] He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs. Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm.. [rubbing hands in Ryan's hair] f*re! That's right! That's right! Little old man boy. Bearded man boy. Oh, wow! That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way. Woooo![laughs] I think Ryan has a gay crush on me. Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes? Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, "Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you." His words. Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading "Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!"] OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless? Got it. [Andy's hand goes up] We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together? Can we speak privately about our relationship? That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up? And... that is why we waited so long to tell people. Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual? Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no? Good, so, we're on the same page? We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans. Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys. A lot. Black guys mostly. I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want. Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me. And guess what buddy, [points at Ryan] I am keeping it. Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby? [to Ryan] Hey. Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan. Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title. Different salary. [laughs] You'll get there, don't worry. Thank you, thank you. Best decision I ever made. I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty. Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why. Good, we're all here, we can get started. Have a seat. Have a seat. Like everybody else. Thank you everyone. Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door] Good night guys. [staff leaves the office] I disagree, I think it was very valuable. I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it. You know, some place romantic and expensive. I don't understand what the big deal is. No! Right, so? No! Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today. I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back. Fine. Then God speed. To both of us. Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people. The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry] No way! Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do. How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive. Uh totally. Yeah. Thank you. So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo. Thanks. That'd be great. Oh... is it... No... Um... I'm uh, I'm dating Jim. We're together. Yeah, great. OK great! May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now. Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to m*rder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy. I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did. And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie. ... It was two hundred dollars.[ New Scene ] I know. I love it there. Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun. Sounds great. No I'm not. I told you I don't want you doing these things in here. You can use your own office or do it in the hall. Can I start talking? Is this thing on? Give me a signal when you want me to start. Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen b*at your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole. This is Michael. You're breaking up. I can't hear you. Yeah, let's go. Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man! Yes, and thank you for sending that to me. Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up. I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in] Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'? Um... that wasn't much of an introduction. And the best way to start is to h*t start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You h*t register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes. Why? No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that. My other boss, Mr. Figaro. Are you a cocktail waitress? It won't. You're so funny. I invited him. Okay, bye honey. Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it? Huh, okay. It's whoever, not whomever. I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night. How did Ryan use it? As an object? No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull. You have a call from Eddie Murphy. [on speakerphone, Eddie Murphy voice] Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! [laughing] I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry. Okay, calm down. I have a small problem. Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas. I'm creative, Ryan. Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store. Yeah! Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little b*tch again. [Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that has a smiley face] Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. [Jan looks impressed] Yep. Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later. N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude. I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist. Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. [To Jan] Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is. Hey hey. I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second. I would love that. Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company. It's ridiculous. Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working. Hey man, you mind if I run something by you? Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that. Thanks. Did I? I don't... Hmm. Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or... Yeah. Question. Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made? I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that. When will that be? Did the police solve the problem with the... Yes, yes they did, yes they did. Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one. If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd k*ll myself. Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend. Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. [hugs Ryan] Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me. Na? Well you tried. Yeah. They sound great. No, they're just hotties. Hey. Hey! Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada. Alright! Yeah. Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight. Ok. Well. Alright! There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, "What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?" He said, "If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks." Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character. No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit. Do you live in a regular sized house? Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here? Good. Well it's weevil season but we were prepared. They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out. You've already been several times. Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection. I'll order you some cranberry juice. This place is like sexy pre-school. I would love a place where we could meet oldergirls. Ahh, wow. That's dangerous. Amazons. You're kidding. She washes dogs. I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom. Yeah, maybe. [notices previous girl talking to another guy] [Michael and Troy dragging Ryan out of the club] Those girls really wailed on you bad. Let's go. Lucky us. Very nice. [to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick? Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off. Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him dr*gs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it. Well, it's effective. Oh boy... On a wing and a prayer, mostly. A formal warning... [chuckles] [stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head. I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really... [on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big. Thanks. I just- No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so... All right, well it already went through, so... That wasn't a tapeworm. Ronnie was bleh. Things were at an all time sad here. But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard. Give him to me. I want him. I need him. I did! Firrrrre-duh guy! [high fives Ryan] Yeah. You too. I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me. So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry. Kevin just made the list. Well that's great. [shakes Ryan's hand] You're talking about your court ordered community service? But he did, right? All right. This is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction. Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin. And you will be responsible for your own medical bills. Oh, hello Ryan. You look well. Cool. Oh that is so sweet. Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so... It's a small office. [sighs] Sixty - forty. Hm? [they shake hands] I'll drive. We're doing this because of you. So why don't you just go stand somewhere else. [to Ryan] Hey. Hey. You shaved? Why? Finally. Right? Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams. Why don't you have a seat? [Phyllis sits] Let's all clap at Phyllis. [everyone claps] Ok! [in Michael Clump voice] When Michael Clump wants to remind you [normal voice] that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy. And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly. Kelly. [kneels down in front of Kelly, Dwight tries to help him down, Michael shouts gibberish at him] Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair. Come on, stand up on your chair. Stand up, stand up, stand up. Somebody help her. Here we go. [Kelly stands up on her chair] Ok, I want you to look at her. She's a beautiful Indian woman. Why? What makes her beautiful? Hey Ryan, look. Shaved off my goatee. I am goateeless. We are the goateeless brothers. Nice. [they bump fists] It's been a little tense. People are suspicious of me. And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular. I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker. I was just hoping middle school was over. What's the only thing worse than one HR rep? Sure. Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King? Oh, from the insurance commercials! Good morning temp. Hey, how's things? Yeah? Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me? Wait, that's pretty weird. Well, Andy has a mug just like that. No. What party? What would you like to drink? For you. I'm with Darryl. [making out with Ryan on her desk] What are we doing? This is so wrong. Mmmm.... mmm. This can't happen again. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, it's well-written and all, I just--- Oh my God. He's going to k*ll us. Oh! He says it's cool. [laughs] He said, "It's cool". That's all he wrote. Mmm hmm. We're back together again baby. They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny. Oh! Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier. Pam. Pam, you gave me your word. Mmhmm. Hey guys that's really inappropriate. Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them? h*t him! h*t him, Chicken. Son of a b*tch. Walk away. Thank you. I know, can you believe it? I guess that's why we have a temp, huh? How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse? You've seen things cleaned before though, right? I think you're great. You're my best friend. Can't do what? Wait, what are you saying? I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you. Oh, can I come? So you're dumping me? Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. [Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It's Michael. Hey, Ryan. Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here? You get paid by the year at the bowling alley? Back to work, shoe b*tch! Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company? Uh, nine. Sorry! Aw, it's gonna be the [softly] worst. Sure. Oh, yeah. Jim's sorry. Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much. But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do. Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend. Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before? That is so insulting. Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times. Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other. Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals. Really! Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop? I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day. Like how? Dyeing my hair blond? Okay it's my turn. Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it? You're gonna make another "spreadsheet." Yeah exactly. It's my turn. We could work from home. No, you're supposed to say, "Rock the house." Try it in another sentence. Pam, I don't make the rules. [Pam walks out.] I don't know. [They shrug and leave.] Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. [Flips a pancake. It's about 8x11 inches] Young sir, would you like a free pancake? Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen? Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great! I made a sale! Oh yeah! That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan? Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce. Bring it in. Morning cheer. [clears throat]Michael, Pam & Tell us what you're talking about. I'm just getting hardcore with him. [on phone] Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. [referencing rolodex card] Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV? [Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat. [honking horn] Time to make the donuts. [laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van] Come on. Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again. Come on. [does it again] De-nied! You know what we need? We need some couches in here. Yeah, I know what a loft is. Most do in the magazines. Corporate greed? Yeah, with a fixed cost pricing model that's correct. Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is. So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive. So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money. I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart. None of 'em called me back. Not even for an interview. Really? Was it nice? I love Pad Thai. You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for? Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales. Seriously? Are you being serious? Yes. Yep. Oh... wow. Of course not. Ah... I'm good, I'm good. And we are prepared to reject that offer. What? Michael. It's a lot of money, okay. But we need money coming in every week. We need jobs. Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish? Agreed. But that's all, okay. Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds] Someone is returning! He started his own company, and now he's back. Who could it be? I'll give you a hint. He is a man. A man you have missed with all your heart. A man who has ruined all other men for you. Who is it? [hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend. I know. Okay, well--- Against who? What? We were something else. Mm-hmm. Yeah, the Commish. So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you? [walks into kitchen] Oh, wow, Stanley. Is that egg salad? Andy brought some salmon. Dwight, is that a meat sandwich? You guys hungry? I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over. With Creed. Playing chess. At work. He's winning. I feel like I'm describing a dream I had. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. That's my client. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him. Hi, Mr. Bart. Hey, it's Dwight here. Give me the phone. Dwight Schrute here. Hey, don't hang up. Ryan, hand the phone over. You're a secretary! What do you know? What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse? He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now. He'll make his decision by the end of the day. Oh. I think you should get it. You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it. Yeah. Who else? Who else? Ryan? I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now. [putting make-up on Ryan] You know when you love a guy and he's giving you mixed signals but you know he really likes you and you're sleeping together? I'll never tell who this song is about. That is a secret that I will take to the grave. It is, but I'll never say. It's our office, too, Oscar. [to Ryan] I think you might have too much rouge. How do you know so much about what's gonna read on camera? Uh... I lived in New York for eleven months. [Kelly nods in agreement] Ok, Erin. Just sh**t it. After I puff on the cigarette, I'm gonna put it out on my high heel 'cause that's what they do in music videos. Yes! We're still setting up! Cut. Cut. We still have to sh**t our make out scene! [teaching Andy & Erin choreography] One and two and cross and cross. Down. Sexy, sexy, sexy. You guys got that? He's your replacement. Ryan, this video is bigger than you or me. They do have sparks. Once upon a time, she was just a girl, living in this worldThen you came along, with your irresistible charmYou drive a girl wild when you flash that sexy smile'cause before she met you things were going okay,So go awaaaaaaay or staaaaaay! That's really great, you guys. Hey Ryan. So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding. It costs about $75 per person. Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not? Okay, Ryan Howard, yes. I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant. [someone knocks] Just pretend we're not here. Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you. $100 now for sure. Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred. Cool. More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories. Hey. What happened? Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with. What? [over chatter] Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think? Okay. No, no, no... no, no... [Dwight listening in his ear piece] Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question. Do you think that I should get a Fedora? Well, I think I'd look really hot in one. Where'd you get your fedora? [Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh! [sighs heavily] I'll give you five bucks for it. Ten. [to Ryan] You're so cool. [Ryan is walking out of the office ahead of him] Oh... where'd you get that hat? I want to sell your blood! These are amazing. You took all these? Oh just by like friends. See you. Hey. Yeah. Never. About what? A little-- what are you talking-- No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now. I-- mmm-- I'm good. Who's Michael? I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare. No thanks. Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook? But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program. Could go either way. Maybe we should just wait and find out. Ok. Quiet! Quiet, please! Please, quiet! Quiet, please. We want to hear your questions. Hey, Ryan. How's it going? Mmm-hmm. Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it. You know what? I think I know the problem. I think you seem distracted. But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help. I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people. Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done. Right. [laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office] Apparently. Not now, Temp. What? Diabolical plan? I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol... [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight's daibolical plan] So what do you want? Yeah. This is all we have. Ryan come here! Come on, come on. Ahhh... Ho ho ho! [struggles to pull Ryan towards him] Come on I need this. Come over here! Just sit down! [opening kite from Ryan] Wow! Cause... [reveals Kite Runner book] Thank you! Alright. Excuse me. [slides past Eric to close the door to Ryan's closet office before Eric can see Ryan in there] If you will - You're twenty minutes late! Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair. Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time. Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw. I like where you're going with this. Continue. I have an old barn! It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what? Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life! He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think! Think! The new IT guy. Nick. I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it. Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock? I don't know what to tell you, man. I'm sorry, I just can't give out his password like that. Are you... you threatening me? [entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible. Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink? Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you. It is not "farm boy swill," I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious. Nope, actually music would just throw me off. I need complete silence. Okay... [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances] You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over. Evolution of dance-dance. Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any? [Stanley raises his hand] Who else? Come on! People, I know models! I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us? Well why don't you invite your friends? Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids. I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring - The Kardashians is a good show. It's about a family. A real-life family. Whoa! What is crackin? What's this game? Yeah, how do you play? Only three tickets. Stop telling me how to spend my tickets. Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique. [Kevin's voice] This is Kevin. This is Kevin. Me, too Oscar. [using a Cookie Monster voice] "My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant." See I did the voice. But parody is always derivative. [typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this. This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic. Ryan? What does he know? When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager. Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see. That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.
