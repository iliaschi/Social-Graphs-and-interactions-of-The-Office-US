Josh Porter, Stamford. And Michael Scott, Scranton. Fine Michael. Thank you. So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets. Thank you. Questions? Yes, thank you. I was under the impression this was, more of like... a meet and greet type deal. Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life. No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael] I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins] Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it. Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So... Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott? What's the square footage? I'm just... Gotcha. Alright. Yeah. Do you have any ice? What do you know? Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan. To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace? And Gromit. [David sighs] Jan? Is Jan there? Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes... ...you just gots to get your freak on. Yeah. Hmmm. Really? Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say. May God guide you in your quest. [at Dunder-Mifflin Corporate in NY] David! Are we all set? Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello. Thought I'd catch a show. Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job. Um, how many people are you interviewing? Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people? Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge? Ah, great. No further questions. Okay. [knocks on door] Hello, hello! Good to see you. Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for. Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job. Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths. Thank you. I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here. I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, "Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!" I don't know, could be good. Or, uh, "Super Duper Paper. It's super duper." I don't know, something like that. Okay. Thank you. It is always a treat whenourpaths cross. So, oh! Before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, uh, Jan and I are back together. So... I may need to fill out one of those love documents again. Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals. I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it? So, that's... my basic 5 year plan. And after that, who knows? Yeah? He's a very nice man. And he's very well suited for the job he has now. You son of a b*tch! You'ref*ringme? Where the hell do you get off? Erratic? No, I wanna know. I wanna know! Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court! No? 'Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about. So, I am gonna... give her a ride home. Let me know about the job. Good, I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions. You know what? That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal? Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though. No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic. And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today. Jim and I... are just... too similar. Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man. A man version. But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay. I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh] Thanks. I'm sorry, wait, so is the question "How'd I get to be so awesome?" [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs] Yes, absolutely. Oh, no, absolutely. [hands David his papers] There you go. [not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great. You know? I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [S*c] energy... New York has, uh... Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight. [David laughs] So that's a... bonus. [thinks] The friendships. [to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?
