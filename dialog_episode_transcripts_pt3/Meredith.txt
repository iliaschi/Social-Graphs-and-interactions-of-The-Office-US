Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check? You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis. I thought your vag*na was removed during your hysterectomy? Surprise! You were surprised, weren't you? You looked freaked, man. We said "Surprise." You were, like, "What?" "What the hell's goin' on here?" Good cake. Why don't you have some? Come on. A little bit. Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good. Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best. [under his breath] I don't know about that. [pretends to vomit] Huh! Thanks, downer. Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old. [laughs] You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... "Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right? That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now. Thank you, delegate from Iceland. DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Yes! Meredith? Good. I didn't say it to him. I said it about him. [in the background] How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either. Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt. I'll take the ... teapot. Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go. [holding oven mitt] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful. This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze. Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink? Go, here we go! Thanks for the party, Michael. Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's? Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat? It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise! All right! I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick. Who's it gonna be? This is where Captain Jack drives the boat. I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity. Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking. Check this out! Look at that! Look at that [squeezes blow-up doll] bwup-bwa! [talks in girly voice] Hello! How are... [regular voice] Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff. That is an excellent goal. ...and a big walk-in closet. Mistake. Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big. Isn't he sweet? [while Jake is throwing things at Michael] They want how many spiral pads? Okay. Ah, thank you sir. You really screwed that up. [Michael leaves] So, is there anything you want to tell us about? Accounting-wise? Idiot. Now we don't have the element of surprise. It's impossible to trap her, and we won't be able to register the look on her face when we ask her if she stole $3,000. Did you use any company money for anything? We're just trying to balance the books. I do, too. That's Jamaican beer? 15. You didn't take any money at all? You're sure? I thought you had two kids. Okay. Thanks for your time. Thanks, Meredith. That was for per diem, for Philadelphia. Attention everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird. I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired. I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'. ...thank you James. [laughs] Yeah. Good to be back. Well, we are running a business, so. A Christmas drinking game ... Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry. See, I told you. You want one Meredith? Oh... Where did you get this stuff? Which aisle? Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office. And when they came over on the Mayflower. Bow chicka bow. Could you scoot over? You're on my dress. You heard me, pack your things. Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head] Hold still, woman! Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited. Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead. Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter. [Meredith parking the car] I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - [metal scraping] [bang] Whoa. OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus. Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize. Thank you. Ohhh... No. No way. [smiles] No, it's fine. I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... thatone time.
