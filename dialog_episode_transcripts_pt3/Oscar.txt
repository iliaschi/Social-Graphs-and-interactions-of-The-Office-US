Well... I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody. I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know. Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man? Did you have a good weekend going there? Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. [to Mr. Brown] Oh, hey! This is Oscar--- Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian. Two fifteenths. Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on. Oh, yeah... Wow. Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right? Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive? Well, it has certain connotations. Like... I don't... I don't know. No. Now, remember that honesty... So I can lower it. Kevin! That's inappropriate. It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune. OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right? It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him? Do you think we should go ? What is he doing? I don't know. Well, what? You could be referring to anything. Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up? Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on? What? Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here. No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25. I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so... I know... Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um... No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape? How many miles did he do last year? Divorce. Um... OK, "Meredith is so old..." That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me. OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25. I want it to be like... "Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous." "Well, guess what, [whispering] that was Michael Scott." "But it was anonymous, how do you know?" "Because I'm him." Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else? Hey, what a game, huh? What a game. You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy. Michael has tapedeveryDundies awards and now, he's making me look through hours of footage to find highlights. "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you. You're just a name and number and no one even says hello." [to Ryan] Card! Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter? [points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean? Wait a minute, what is this? What? Really? Oh! Youplay that. Go! Go! Go! Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch. [hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done. Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto. Do not panic. Go in single file lines. Pam. Hey. [looks to Oscar] Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day. Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department... ... that has three people... ... doing the work that could be done by two. Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most. Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just... What? No... Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me. A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. [out of character] Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface? I heard they made out and had sex. Try "profits". No! Try "Michael Scott". "Michael" "boss" and "funny". [Sadiq (IT guy) types; result pops up] Oh my God, wow! [chuckles] E-mail from Stanley. Stanley, Terribly nice guy. [reads e-mail] "Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late." Well, Stanley's an ass. Not one of our harder workers. Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy! What other ghost stories do you have for us? That I'm a robot? [robot voice] I will destroy everything in my path- Beep! Bop! Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk. [Tin Man voice] Oil can. Oil can. Alright. Oscar, got big plans tonight with- I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did. Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever k*lled anybody.Kevin & I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that. First present, Oscar. Oh, good, that was from me. Well, I call it fun! Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn. Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me! Oh, hey. Listen up. We're going to Poor Richard's. Who's in? Yes. Leader... ship. The word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership," as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork! Hey, Oscar? I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok. The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow. Ok, let him know that I'm here. What difference does it make whether your here? Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather? Really? Oh, that is a shame. You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic. What are your symptoms? Umm, hmmm. Checks out. I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday. Unless you're still sick. So have a great long weekend. Gil. Hey guys. Ahem. What's up? Maybe! Well, yeah. [to Oscar] Who do you think did it? Alright. Whose it from? [to Oscar] Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um... He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing. [laughs maniacally] Yeah. Yes! Well hi Chet. So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you. You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend. Mmm. Right. So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin! Oscar... Birthday party subs! My gift to you. Have you ever taken any illegal dr*gs? Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some dr*gs in your system without you knowing about it? Have you ever... pooped... a balloon? [opens eyes wide in total surprise] Company policy. If dr*gs are found on the premises there is a*t*matic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours. No, not at all. Um... let's um, let's keep our clothes. What's the problem? It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace. So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating? No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose. Come on, seriously, that? Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win. How about, I leave it up? Win. Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America. Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts. Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go. I have an ace. Okay. So what is it that you wanted to talk to me about? But... I guess that's it. So, call me when you have news. Okay? Michael said to stop by on your way out. [door bangs] Are we absolutely sure it's not an accounting error? That's a very nice watch, Oscar. I've never seen it before. He must have d*ed very recently. Yeah. We're missing $3,000 and we're trying to figure out where it went. Michael is the obvious suspect, but he is the boss, so we have to at least pretend to ask other people first. I knew it. Well, about three months ago, I was on a sales call and I broke the heel on my shoe and I only had the corporate card. I'm really sorry. $14. $3,000? That wasn't me. Don't yell at me. Gosh, I don't think so. Oh, we know you did... or someone else did. Oh, I love Red Stripe. Yeah. We should go out and get a beer after work. Or, hey, you want to go right now? Yes. I'm a single mom. I would never do anything to jeopardize my kid. My ex-husband took Wendy, the good one. We're in the process of interviewing everyone in the office. I think it's kind of fun. It's a great chance to catch up with people. I'll tell you what, if I find out who did it, I will shake their hand, pat them on the back, give them 72 hours to get out of the country, and then I'll let you know who it is. Is there anything else? I don't know. Why? What's going on? Why? All right. I've never seen it. Kevin, it's really bad.[ The Accountants, Webisode 05 - "Someone in the Warehouse" ] Yeah, I do think it's someone in this office, which really breaks my heart, to tell you the truth. Because I thought we were all good people here. Who? Kevin, cut it out! No. Well, he keeps the key behind his computer... Oh, Roy, one more question. What do you think of Angela? But you can if you want to. But you don't have to.[ The Accountants, Webisode 06 - "The Memo" ] It obviously isn't Dwight because he has the most integrity of anyone in the office. [both Oscar and Kevin glance over to the camera] What? Did you talk to Kelly? I talked to Creed, and he said he didn't do it. And then he tried to sell me dietary supplements. We are missing $3,000. Things are getting tense. Okay. Yeah. 'Cause I'm telling you that I didn't. My friend gave it to me. Diane... Chester... Snydburgh. You guys, this is stupid, that we're turning on each other. That is exactly what they want us to do. Yeah, we know. Basically, we're convinced that Michael took the missing $3,000, so we're waiting until he leaves his office so we can go in and search for evidence. When I say it out loud, it really doesn't seem like a good idea. I think you're mean. What are you doing tonight? Wanna get a beer? What are you doing? What happened to your old wok? Thank you. That was uncomfortable. [imitating Animal House's Bluto] Get it? Don't touch anything. You'll leave fingerprints. Awesome. Do you think this thing is worth $3,000? It's cool. Okay, this drawer is locked. Oscar, do you have a key? He has a snow-globe drawer. I like it. No. Well, it's about to be shut off. Okay. This is pointless. Someone just has to talk to him.Kevin and And here. Well, Dwight says that Michael didn't take it, but frankly, I think he's hiding something. [clears throat] What? You did? Where? Excuse me? Well, that doesn't sound like me. Absolutely not. Very well. Case closed. Very well. Listen man, I am so sorry. I had no idea. No. No it's not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people "f*ggie" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude. [in reference to Oscar being gay] It explains so much. That is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you. The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays. Ah damn pop-ups. We're all h*m*! h*m*. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people. I mean anybody could be gay. Business-men. Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here. However you want to do it. Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you. I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them. Well, I just like to look good OK, so --- No, I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero! Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag. You misunderstand-- OK. You know what, OK. I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is. You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend --- ...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me! All right, um... sorry. Oh, there's Gill. Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows? [reading the note with the gay-dar] "Hope this helps. -Jim" Nice! [singing] ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum [Oscar and Gil walk through door] But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits. Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation? Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left. Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee? Yeah. No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. [starts to cry] And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations. Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy... just... there's something about him that creeps me out. I can't really explain it. He's always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for "being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me." I don't understand how someone could have so little self-awareness. No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific. No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga. Are you enjoying your fiesta? So does this remind you of your childhood right now? A good manager doesn't f*re people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business. This is culture to you? Yeah, on Van Gogh's first try, he drew the hands of the peasants. Meaning, real art takes courage, okay? And honesty. No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes. Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight. You saw it? Describe it please. Oh... Nice. [Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten. There's like ten green ones. We have a lot of angry customers out there. This puts us at thr*at level midnight. Accounting, you are on customer service duty today. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people. But guess what? From now on, you guys are no longer losers! So give yourselves a round of applause. [Kelly and Kevin clap] [on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point. I'm sorry. No, I amsosorry. Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations. Oooh, yes. Facial. You two are apes. Still said it. Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume? Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. [everybody sits down on beach] OK, everybody up! Circle 'round. [motions for circle to form] Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor. Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! [contestants start walking] No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready? Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day. All right. [smiles] No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me. No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo. Why? But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk] No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael. Dwight is our new boss. I think it's gonna be Michael. No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one. Excellent question, Pam. 1/100th of a cent. HEY! COME ON! Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam]
