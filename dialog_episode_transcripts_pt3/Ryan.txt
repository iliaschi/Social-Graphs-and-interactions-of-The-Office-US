Hey. Guilty! Guilty as charged! Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges. Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch. Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp. [Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round. So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff? You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK? What are you watching? Really? No way. I think she likes this stuff. Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but... Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism. Good. Really? Today? Oh, Happy Birthday. Yeah, I could say something. All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right. No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs. [laughs] And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs. [ignores Phyllis)] Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart. Yes. All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch? [Ryan scores] Nice! Come here! [gives Ryan a chest bump] [Darryl scores] Watch the long passes, you guys! Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please? Ryan. Would you like to help me with a special project? [in Michael's car] Okay, just throw out all the empties. Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin. No. Uh, what flavor? Blue's not a flavor. What, stop! Whoa! That's my Drakkar Noir. No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it. Not it's not, there's some in the straw. [Michael opens bottle and wipes straw along his neck] There, now you may throw it out. That's over several months, Ryan. Sorry. Yeah. [singing to music] "Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you." Here you go. Except pass that breathalyzer. I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast. Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan. Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. "Home Alone," "Risky Business." Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do. Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration? Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so. Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think. Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be? Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager? [speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is? You need to play to win. But... you also have to win to play. Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations. So what was rule two? Okay, uh, well, one is taken. NO! Well, he needs a permanent number, right? No. That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers... Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it? Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh? Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop! So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for m*rder, 'P' is for... ...for Phone. What? Um, oh, thinking about business school? Really? So you think you know a lot about business? Uh huh. Yeah. Quiz me. Quiz me up. When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me. [to Dwight] Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please? [to Ryan] Uh, it's equal. [to Ryan] You should learn from him, right? Right? Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be? I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think? Nah, I'm okay. Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo... Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find. I gave it to you in the car. I saw you program it in. Okay. Alright. You failed? [singing] ...since the world was turning. [looking at Roy and Pam] They are soo cute. Answer me this, though. Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp? Really? Oh... hey. [singing and tapping on his coffee mug] I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day. Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information. Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is. Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. "Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority." Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you. Uh, Larissa Halpert. 117 Mount Bergin St. [in his office on his cell phone, talking in a fake high voice] Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland. This is Tito. Thanks. Stacy. [Taps on the glass in his office to get Ryan's attention] Pick up. They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out. Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now. My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for? I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott. [Knock at the door] Yeah. Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend? If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout. No. They're in the conference room. Wait, are those Michael's Levis? If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang. Pow! Pow! Pow! Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface. Sam, get my luggage. Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them. Hello, everybody? Yeah, uh, attention, please. Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p. Well, the group tour is now leaving, then. Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows. I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to. Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while. We'll see. No, don't! Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away. You don't know that. I did? I'll take the iPod. [after Ryan opens a new gift - a nameplate saying 'Kelly'] That was meant for Kelly. Hi guys. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how's it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin] Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, Merry Christmas. Mine. All right! No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan. Where is my cornbread? Thank you. Did you get all dark meat like I like? Where are the yams? Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg? And they had no yams? Wow, you just dive right into it. uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall? [popping his bubble wrap cast] Hey! You did it! Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan. Did you get the yams? [sigh] Ok, I'll just have the pudding. Yeh. Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain. Mmm, what flavour coffee is that? Up-dog? I don't know, nothin', what's up with you? Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning. Do you think you can handle it? Do youthink? Or do youknow? Just do it. Good. Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis. Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her. It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy. Uh... June. Summer. So, that'll be nice. And that's that. Oh, nothing. What? I did not do that. That sounds disgusting. [to Jim] Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones... It's the lever on the side. Hey! Nothing much. Let me ask you something. It's actually little awkward. What do you think of Kelly? Are you interested in her? Really? She said lots of things. I have no idea. No. I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever. Alright. [Kelly squeals] Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in] I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So... OK, That's cool. I completely understand. Ryan. Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think. But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding. I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married? Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just... Maybe. Thanks. Yeah. I'm definitely going. Nice. Send me a postcard. God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies! I drink like, a hundred Ice Macchiatos a day, and practically nothing else. There's a really cool coffee place, Jitters, at the Steamtown Mall. Ever been there? You've never been to Jitters? Ryan, you aresodorky. Gimme your number, so I can text you. That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?! Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child! Okay. It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. [gets up and runs out] Ryan, can you come here a second? [clears throat] I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar. I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine? Oka-- Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves. Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer]. Don't be scared! You're good! You're good! I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night. Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me you keys. Don't make me do this the hard way. I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him. Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies? Yeah, we do testing all over the country. You want to work at the urinalysis lab? That's a nice tie. That is... who makes that? Do you mind if I wear that for the photo? "Ryan never returns my calls." Ugh, join the club. Oh, me too. Me too. It's a deal. Yesh. Oh, great. Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse? Oh, it's okay, I'm going down. Awesome! Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay. Do you want to talk about it anymore? You made this? Wow. [impressed] That's... that's very nice. Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they? No, I said one of them is not a nickel. Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ... A man is found hanging from the ceiling... A hunter. So you excited? Very excited? Extremely excited? ... Just very? That's cool. I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions? Do you know where we are, temp? And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you. Smells pretty bad, doesn't it? It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away. Oh hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back. This is Pretzel Day. It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness. You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test? Please be seated. [man runs behind Dwight] Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground. What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin? Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's su1c1de? Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear? Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose. Wrestle him to the ground. You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams. Establish time frames. Keep the phrase "real dollars" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much. Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time. Good. Right. Uh huh. Exactly. Yes. Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much! They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face. Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive. [Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere. Pam? All they are is chocolate, graham cr*cker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been? [laugh] Kelly Zach Braff [speaks in Hindi] Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys. Don't even listen to them. They're so... All right. Good night. So you're saving money... ...to start a family and home. I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst. Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics? [to Kelly] I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense. I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood. That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh. Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right? [interupting] Hey Ryan, you coming? Okay. Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now? Oh. You know, man, it's really you're call. [whispers] Let me get that for you. This one taken? No. Good. [using breast pump] Take a picture. It'll last longer. Is he always like this? Yeap. Yeah. I would so rather be in prison. Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! [employees protest] All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's b*tch. Oh, and you. [points to Ryan] You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap! Ah, I need my entourage [both exit Michael's office] Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters. Why not? Ok, feel better. OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude. I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know. Hey, so what's the status. Oh, you're kidding me? Cold, huh? ... I'll take the kid. No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back. Um-hmmm. You want the lead? So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard. I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan? Hello, Ryan. What do you have for us? Good luck. Hey, Ryan? You wanna pull a prank on Andy? I liked you better when you were the temp. [Giggles.] Look at that. Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors. No. Yes. Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot. Do you guys think she was hot? Do what? I just asked you a question. Yeah, right. God, I need a boyfriend. You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends. Whenever. Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you... Wow. Will they throw their hats, you think? A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air. "May your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... That was a pretty good line. I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey! Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now. The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well. Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies. ...And products! Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a f*re trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT! Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things. Thank you. f*re you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God... No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands] No, it is here. Good thing you didn't listen to me. That is the bravest thing I have ever heard. I can. You would have left me to fend for myself. Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed. Oh it was? Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a m*rder's in your apartment in the middle of the night... ...and you call me, to calm you down... There's a bunch of people back here, maybe... You are so mean. Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard. You called me stupid. Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor. No, no. Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty. What?! So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue. So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc. And let's just say that I just sent backLove Actually, which was awesome. [Karen lays money down on the desk next to Ryan] And they sent meUptown Girls, which is also awesome. But guess what, now I want to see love actually again, [Phyllis throws her money down] but it's at the bottom of the que! Oh no, what do I do!? [Creed throws his money down] What I do, is this. I go online, I go click, click, click. And I change the order of the que, so that I can seeLove Actually[Pam throws her money down] as soon as I want to. It's so easy, Ryan. Do you really not know how Netflix works? [Jim throws his money down] No really, it's, it's very nice. Come on! This is just offensive. Crisis Management Squad. I want you to bring a partner. [whispering] It's just, like, so creepy. Anna Maria's. Six-month anniversary. What? No, we've been dating for six months. Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend. [to Ryan] Come on! Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba! What are you saying? OK, I apologize for yelling at you. www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out. You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management! Good thing I'm baaaaaack. [laughs] Ryan, coffee. [on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty. But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job. [laughs] Great! I'm so glad. We're all very excited you're going to be joining us. It'll be nice to have another MBA around here. Who was that?
