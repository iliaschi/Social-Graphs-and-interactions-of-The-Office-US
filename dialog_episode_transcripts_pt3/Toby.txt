All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good. Get out. Come here. [hugs Oscar and In a low voice] Don't cash that till Friday, OK? Yeah. Thanks. Toby, Katy. Yeah. Cool. What year were you there? Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right? You and your wife, and you have kids. Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too? Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. "Old School". Yes, Toby? Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family. No, no, Toby. No. It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on! What? NO! What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes? Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away. [kissing noises, sheep baaing sounds] She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her. Thank you. Hi, is it over? No. I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over. Um... what about office romance? Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin! What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her "partner" in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line? What if they made out? In front of everybody? At home? And I told everybody everything about it. Hey, Toby. You said that we could come to you if we had any questions. Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vag*na look like? Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly. Good. Good. And... No, I've seen the video. Is your wife still your contact? 'Kay. I've got the key. Hey, Toby. Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday. Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner. Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion. Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody. [now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael. [unwrapping the poster] Yikes. We can drink? Hey! [loud noise in bathroom] No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me! I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall. Ugh, not you. Someone else. Get Pam. Get Ryan. He needs to lift me. [Ryan shakes his head] and he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel. No, he's not. I just saw him. No he did not. I don't need his permission. I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter. And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us. Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work related? I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there. I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice. Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up. When did you go there? Really for like how long? [looks at Sasha] Mmm... hello tiny one. Yep. [spreads tablecloth] No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves. [Toby knocks on door] Yeah? Oh, that's okay, she can keep those. Thank you. You have to ask me that because you work for human resources. Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost. Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids? What about... ...Jan. Kay. ...Or biologically. Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I... Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will! I never really thought about death until Princess Diana d*ed. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's. Somebody got donuts for my birthday! You didn't know it was my birthday. Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut [closes box]. I hate you. And laughter... also. Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party. Is that true, Toby? Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal dr*gs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with? Yes it is. Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair. I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly. [walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio? Angela! No. Yes. Yeah? Okay. What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So... Okay... what? It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste. Yes. Are those all the other complains? I would like to see those please. You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file. Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it? [sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's. You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me. That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ? I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking. To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn. Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York? Oh... ok. I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file. Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna... Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me? What are... That's insane. Wow. No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody "f@ggie". Why would anybody find that offensive? That's what f@ggie means! No not really... It wasn't just an action movie, it was d*e Hard! Exactly! Yeah, I know. OK, a little too far, crossed the line. That's not what it's called. Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It's not like gay... shame festival. So did you hear? Pam's back on the market again. I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat. Hey! What's up? [answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What's up? Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here. Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has d*ed. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk. [breaking down] How do you know? That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing? Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second... No... No, You're not going to collect them. [facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down. You knew about this all along, didn't you? I don't understand. Hey! How'd the run go? What was your mile time? [scoffs] I could b*at that on a skateboard. Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk. Hey, Toby! How are you, man? I just wanted to say hi. Oh. Is that like your new thing? No. It's cool. All right. Good to be back. All right. No problem. [off camera] ...what? No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself. Yeah. Shh! [answering phone] This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from? They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so. [to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving Kn*fe out of the trunk. That's crazy. It's crazy. Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas. It's Christmas Toby. Toby... [sighs] Please? Please? It's all... [Pam walks away.] OK. Yeah, we do a raffle... Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing] Not now, not ever. Aww, none of your business. That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops. This is probably the icebreaker you need. I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv. No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo? [to Toby's date] Hi. I'm Kevin. [to Toby] Where did you find her? One... Two... Three. Ahhhh! [Phyllis throws the flowers, Ryan knocks them out of Kelly's hands, Toby's date gets them] We have... a bat... in the office. So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied? Oh! No, you should go. Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out. Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you. Hey, don't you have a daughter? No... Ok, what... what is the situation Toby? Thank God. I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an att*ck position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my w*apon from its secure hiding place. Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end. You know what? I didn't--- ...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not. Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night... I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you! Toby, come on. Let's go. What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher? How about you, man. Comfortable? Maybe I'll stay overnight. Got a cousin lives down there. Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers. No. You gonna play it like this? You give me a good raise, or no more sex. [Toby begins to write] [to Toby] What are you writing, perv-ball? Just preparing for the deposition. Ok, Toby, how about if you... Toby now has the floor... and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go! Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and... Ok, you know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not? What about a long sleeve T? Long johns? A shaw? Yes. Okay, let's do another one. This is a good one. "A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---" Just... Here you go. [hands money] Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone] What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down] Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... [laughs] Oh, come on. We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul. Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher. Yes. [in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often. Well, you can't swim in leather pants. [laughs] I'm just yankin' your chain. Not literally. Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going. I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck. Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.
