And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs. Darryl Rogers? So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on. Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me. Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. [clucking and dancing like a chicken] Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man? Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face! Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday. What? My bad. Can we just do one? That's cool, that's fine. sh**t, sh**t it. [Roy hits Jim in the mouth with his elbow] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Foul! Naked aggression! Oh, that is... You all right Jim? Suck it up. What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason? Well, let's just say whoever was ahead won. No, no, no, I'm not coming in on Saturday. [clears throat] Alright, so let's get this party staaaarrrrted. Time to bring out the big g*n. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a k*ller joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. [to Warehouse guys] Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just k*ller. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got? Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day. Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense. I don't feel bad. You look good. Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead? That's her? No! You banged her? No! No way! It... no. You wanna be Santa? Have you ever seen Santa? Okay. I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man. It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man. Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league. Oh, no. That is not worth it. Never. Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it. No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it. Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone? No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse. Come on! [on phone] So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring. Very good, nice doing business with you. Thank you. [hangs up] Yes! [chuckles] Oh, yeah! Read it and weep. Oh! Oh, look at that! [puts post-it on Phyllis' forehead] Look at me, Phyllis! Oh, what is that? That's my sale! [humming then dancing victoriously] No. Just ... You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just... So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some sh*ts. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear? [blows a sigh of relief] Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there. Flowers. Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself. Stand clear. I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine. Oh, oh, oh! We'll get somebody to clean that up. Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know? OK. OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh... I... That was just... I hate that too! [general clapping and agreement] I feel you. Not literally. Yes. Ah, you do. So... It blows. It blows, man. Gah... Absolutely. You know you're right. You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys. Dockworker's? Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks. The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them. Yeah-es. I'm just going to put this over there. Thank you to our hosts. That is! I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works? It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are f*re-eaters all over the place. Not. I said, not that. That's ironic. That you are afraid. Dinkin' flicka. [sighs] Dinkin' flicka. Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture] I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, "You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)"? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words. Darryl. Noble Darryl. [sighs] I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me. So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and... Well that blows. Hi. Oh, ok. OK, Hey, man, how's it going? That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me? OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not "packaging." Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people? OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it. And you sent that out to everyone? Sure. [knock on door] Yeah. Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat. You know what? Actually, let's go into the conference room. [long pause] I am declining to speak first. Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now. What? No, this is a power suit. [Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again. Ohh... kay. All right. No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway. Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes. Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise. [mumbles jibberish] [mumbling softly] That was a very good point. I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me. Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes. Oh. [scoffs] Come on. Be serious. I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much. I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub. Plus perks, yes. Fourteen years. No, please, please... Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes. I still think he's way overpaid. Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia. I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise. Well what am I supposed to do? I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous. [exhales] That's true. You know what? I should. I have been a loyal employee for a long time. You know what? I deserve a bump. Oh, so I'm crazy now? Yeah. Fine. [imitating Chris Tucker] Don't ever touch a black man's radio! ...Chris Tucker.Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way. Well... Mm, the Big Apple. How would we get home? Maybe I'll stay. Well... Hey guys, Jan is ready for you. Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity. All right. Today is Safety Training Day. Toby is leading ours upstairs. Yeauck. But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity. Hmm. I can, and I have. You're not allowed to drive the forklift. Okay. Um, her. Ah, fine. Yeeesh. [barely keeping his composure] "Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!" [laughs] And I fell and busted my ankle. I'm legitimately scared for my workers. It's on! Dammit, Michael. Pay attention, man. You really wanna bet? Ok, you're on. [mouths] Damn... What are you guys talkin' about? What are you--- Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. ... Only on the rarest of occasions... ...would I go near--- Wow, that is... that time really adds up. That's like... a half an hour, every hour? Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom. [to warehouse guys] Sorry, he is very lame. [takes book from Toby] Um, let's see. "Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter." Ok guys, you know what? I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation. Are you kidding me? Yeah, but ours was real, Michael. Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really, what is it? You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life. What do I have to live for? It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand, or what I want. The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be. Do you really mean that? I'm braver than you? I Braveheart. I am.
