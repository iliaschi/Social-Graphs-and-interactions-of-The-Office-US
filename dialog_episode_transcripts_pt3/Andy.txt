Why did I transfer to Stamford? I think that's pretty obvious. I got promoted! And you can't b*at that view... right? Uh-huh, yeah. I am. OooOK. I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day. So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna. ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name. Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on. He's so talented. [clapping her hands in unison] Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! I'm just k*lling Germans, any way I can. [sounding upset] Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute? Yes now. This is not working, ok? We are getting slaughtered out there. Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about... SNIPE-- JIM! You don't snipe in Carrington, ok? Andy, it's not--- Oh yeah, definitely. Yeah, all day. Oh, there's no game. We're just trying to get these chips for Karen. Yeah, nothing there. I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it. Sure. That's it? That's what you came up with? Really? Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Yeah, I shook it, I shook it. 'Scuse me? Wow. Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds. What's that? He's a perfect match. Yep. Oh, Holy Mother of God. She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a f*re? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks! No one. Andy, no acappella. [sing] fi-i-i-ine! Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike. Really? Wow... that's bad. Well, I work here now. If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will k*ll myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one. Hey Andy! I just want to say thanks. Good luck. The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats. Yeah. You know what? I think you just need to meet him. Right on. [to Andy] Hey is that Josh's computer? Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh? I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs. Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome! A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you. Oh. In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need. Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager. So you'll be reporting to me, then. My title has 'Manager' in it. Oh. I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them. [recording phone message] Karen Filippelli. Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works. Sure thing, buddy. Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm. Oh. I do like it, actually. Thank you. Ssshh stupid! Um... That's it! Yes, yes! Okay! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow! You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy! And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] f*re Andy. f*re. Andy. Uh... that I have not decided yet. Staples. Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please. Xterra's not even a real word. Oh, so you drive an X-Earth? That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth. Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87. Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die. Idiot! If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world. [coughs sentence] You're the idiot! [picks up phone] Jim Halpert. ...Okay I can't... help you... with that. She is dating Ryan, I think. She's... high-maintenance. Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one. ...Absolutely you should. I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals. Frisbee-based competitions... She... Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo? Wow... I-- Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam. Quick question - do you play the guitar? Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice? Hey. Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair. Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black. No. No, you get outta here. Yes. [putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol. As ranking number three in this office, I am order - You're number four. Damn it! All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway. Hooters? Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'. Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy. I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out... I'm just gonna call her. What can I get for 'ya? I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look] Nothing he's doing is cheering me up. Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. [Cindy laughs and walks away] Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention] No, it's not. I don't think... I love it! [laughing] I don't know what he's doing. Probably. Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there? You know what we should do? We should invite them to the Christmas party. Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend. [singing] And if you want love, we'll make it. Swim in a big sea of blankets. Take all your big plans and break 'em. This is bound to take awhile. Your body is a wonderland. [Michael notices Cindy ride up to him on the bike and looks confused] Your body is a wonderland. Your body is a wonderland. You can't see... You can't see my stomach. Fantastic. That's all she said. ... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal. Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you. Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first. Oh. Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you. Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot. Please. Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos! Here we go. In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down. Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment. Leave the keys! Hawkman. You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big. You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency. I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company. No. Stop it. [Puts his hand on Andy's shoulder] Stop it. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did? Yes. Ah, no. Don't worry about it. What? You can pay me back later for the makeover. Yes, Andy. He didn't say. I knew it. [Dwight and Jim walk in] You are lying right now. Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... . What happened on your sales call? [in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over. Is that you singing? Nice job. You gonna answer it? Yikes. Thank you. Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover. Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman... I said 'was'. What does that even mean? That is impossible. Oscar. Hey, what's up. Yep. I don't know. Maybe. Bathroom. Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you. Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office. Yeah, do you? What did I say? Huh. Oh, no. Okay. [moves away] Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep. I don't like him, his giant head, or his beady little eyes. That's all I got to say on the matter. Okay, good. Stay right here. Yeah. No. No. What are you talking about? You know what? Maybe it's in the ceiling. Okay. Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly. Um. No. I don't want to do any of that. No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy. Yeah. It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm. Oh, hi. You must be Andy. That's right, it's so good to meet you. Thanks. Well, you ready to have some fun? [scoffs] I... will never say a word. And now, we are even. I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell. On time. Now I'm back. Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it. [in a forceful voice] So look out Dunder Mifflin! [laughs] [snaps] I mean, look out... in a fun way! You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you... Oh, welcome back, Andy. Oh. Drew. Sorry. Apology not... accepted. Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place. [laughs] Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to sh*t of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back. And I've got a new attitude. And a new name. And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies. Hey, Andy. How are you, man? What's that? No, I'm not gonna call you that. Andy. Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear att*cks. Yeah! I'm temporarily lifting the shun. It means nothing. I need you to do something for me. Okay, calm down. I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle. What do you think? You've got an hour. Shunning resumed. [out of breath] Guys! Listen up! Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange! [hesitates] Un-shun. I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun. No, sweet cheeks. We need someone who's actually made a sale. Andy, you go. [in accent] I like ice cream too, mate. Alligators and dingo babies. What's that? You know her name. It's fine. What about music? Do you have any music? I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD. Lord, beer me strength. Did thatreallyneed to be said? Well not everything a guy says needs to be said. Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation. Oh, is she that teacher in the white? Which one... is she? Wow. No, I don't think so. Nope. No. Oh, Andy. You know what? We don't have alotof time, so we should probably... Andy--- Ohh... Andy? Oh... yeah... This is weird. I... gotta go to Spanish. Oh my God. Well... that's not gonna hold up in court. All right. Not important. Because you're not dating her. Because it's a felony. But--- Andy... is having arealrough day today. "Good luck." You want music? Come on man, just give it a couple days. I think you'll be all right. [singing the intro to The Lion King's "The Lion Sleeps Tonight"] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh... OK, I'll call therealpolice. [on the phone] OK. What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this. [in women's bathroom] Oh... my... God. Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building. No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those. You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming! Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests. No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar] Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar] I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America. Thank you so much. [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle] I don't want to h*t the big rock! I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it. [takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get h*t by it... What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified. [at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp! I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up. Team U.S.A.! Gryffindor! Gryffindor! That's not why you lost. Yeah, right. [bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that? What, Andy? Andy, what should I tell them? I don't understand what you want from me. Sorry! Bye, Andy! Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today. WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA! Do it! [exhales loudly] Andy... Nothing. Yup. Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified. Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps] Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name] Andrew Bernard. I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color? Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table? What is the capital of Maine? Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't wanna hear about it. Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company. You're not off to a very good start, Bernard. I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say? [Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed. Michael is gone. make Andrew Bernard my number two. As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug] Okay--- What--- No wait, what are you doing?! David, I did not tell her. It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs] It's so intimidating! Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
