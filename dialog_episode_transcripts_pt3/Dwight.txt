People say I am the best boss. They go, "God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious." "And you get the best out of us." [shows the camera his WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts. Whassup! Whass...up! Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing? What are you doing? It's not on your desk. It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation. Why not? [crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me. Downsizing? Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight. Assistant to the Regional Manager. Can't you just tell us. You don't know what it is. [Laughs] I don't need your permission. Can you promise that? Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings. Introduce yourself. Be polite. Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything. That's his profit. New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos. OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here? [Laughing] That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim. What is that? No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food. How do you know it was me? Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop. Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores. Do you really have to do that right now? Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight. That is not the expression. You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go. Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out. Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him. Um... Well, we only have an hour. Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness. Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you? OK. Ok, you're thinking of a superhero. No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that. Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me. That's nice, Dwight. OK, I like your food. OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver. Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it. Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train. Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan. You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace. Nope, you cannot use it. Temporary workspace. You can use it. If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already. What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people. Dwight, what... It says "workspace". If it's the same thing, then why did you write "workspace"? You are not my superior. OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan? This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything. You cut more than you had to, didn't you? Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance? OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies. Why would you want to raise your cholesterol? Is it a good plan? Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts? No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK? Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I...lovehim. OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential. OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway? Damnit! Damnit Jim! What are you talking about? OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake? Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created k*ller nanorobot infection. Absolutely not. No I didn't. It's an epidemic. Sounds tough. Do you? Mmm hmm. Yep. Good luck. [closes door and locks it] [answering phone] Jim Halpert. Who is this? No, you can't f*re me. Hey Pam! How are you? I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to? I have nothing to do. Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything. The mall? Hello? This is Jan. Who is this? From sales? Where's Michael Scott? Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand? Really? OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately. No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again. Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it. [under his breath] Oh, Christ. I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options. What about confidentiality? Could you mean vag*na? Because if you do, I want that covered. A uterus is different from a vag*na. I still have a vag*na. That's a real thing. Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits? Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] "Hi. I'm Mork from Ork." Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo. Oh! God. Dwight, come on... There's no downsizing. Assistant to the regional manager Dwight. But there's no downsizing, so just don't... It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Tr*mp is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, "You're fired." [as Donald Tr*mp] "You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed." It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. [as Donald Tr*mp] "You're foir-ed." I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, "You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want." But that's unrealistic, so... Why'd you do this? Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip? Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out. Absolutely, I do. At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me. To what? And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says "No, Jim, here's a way." Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground. Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products? What? No. What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam. Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing? But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away. [to the camera] Can you get her? She's right there. [camera zooms in on Meredith at here desk] That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. [laughs] Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, "Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers." Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, "Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael." [pretends to vomit and laughs] Yeah, what do you think that's about? You are not going to believe this. Well, tensions were high in the kitchen. Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off. Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking... Their bread is very good. OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off. OK, yeah. [looking at birthday card] Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath. Yeah. What do you know about Meredith? There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend. I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside. [laughs] Which one is that again? Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus? OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday. I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there. What? What? [gives Dwight a high five] Great. I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision. Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open. I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe. So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box? Right... That's good. [on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that... [looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about? Come on. Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves. All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. [Ryan holds up his bag] Very good. Excellent, excellent. Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you. No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior. [to camera] When I let him come to my pick-up game... [to Dwight] I vouched for you. I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar. Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and b*tch and I don't want to have to deal with that. Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager. No, it's not. It's lower, so... It's close. I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings. Nerd. That is why you're not on the team. No, no, ridiculous. Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight. Sorry Phyllis. No, I'm team captain. No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager. No. Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys. Aw, come on Dwight. On. Just put it on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here. [Jim saves the ball from going out of bounds and passes to Michael] Here we go. Three! [sh**t and misses] Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone! De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap]Michael and Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight! Dwight! This is a cold pack... Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else. It's illegal. Can't do that. Next best thing. All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse. Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm against v*olence in the workplace. Nobody cares what you think. So do you like the periwinkle and the purples? She'd be perfect for you. So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager. Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss. Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there. Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you h*t a stall you have a perfect fall back. You buy a purse. Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ? Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them. Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her. I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So.. No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto--- No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not. But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later. She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home. Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot... No. I cannot promise you that. Listen, Dwight. Yeah, uh no. I don't think so I'm really busy. I can't. I really can't. No. Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah, it was. We're not laughing at you, Dwight. Um, just something somebody wrote. [laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall. [whispering] It's about Michael. Dwight, get out of here!![The door swings open and Dwight is being pushed out by Phyllis] What were you doing in the ladies room?! Why were you peering over the stalls?! You are a pervert! You, are, a pervert! Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh. You're taking away our bathroom? But where would we...go? Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now. Just don't, don't talk- Don't talk- Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us. Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever. [clapping] Best Dundies ever. Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.[Quick cut to everybody talking and ignoring Dwight] "You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-"[The music stops, Michael looks back at Dwight] [to Dwight, in a low voice] Shut it. [normal voice] Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight. No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy. And I was about to take her bra off... ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork- Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on. He's a volunteer. Dwight come on, come- I'm sorry, you're gonna have to put your clothes back on, people are trying to eat. Great work tonight. Excellent. I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer. That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational. Um, I... Hey, send me that link to the monkey sex video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot. I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have. No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was? That's what she sai [clears throat] Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself. Hey Dwight. Sure. Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that. I should get back to work. Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate. Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you. Oh. Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough. Sign the papers at the condo. Uh, I don't need one. I don't need a representative. No, No. No. Dwight. I'm fine. Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal. Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work. Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come. As my associate. No it is not. Ok. See you soon. I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing? What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't... please... I... Just... Would you put it up? [roof opens] Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner. Home, sweet home. Nice to meet you too. Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um. Are we ready to sign some papers? Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that. This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. [points at wall] Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall. I'm putting my bed right over here. Well, then I will get a warrantee. Well then I won't get a warrantee. So that's the problem, is solved. What? And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow. Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total. Ok, ok, ok. Alright. Ok. Alright. Oh boy. Actually yes. Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me. Oh, man. I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun. There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today. Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities. I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone. What the hell is a terrarium? Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place. Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it. We take separate cars. Why would we do that? No. EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok. A little bit more and I would have had it. Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst. Nobody likes beets. Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet. Stop it! [smacks Dwight's arm] Time to b*at is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. [Michael and Dwight enter] Guys? Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er? Get up here, Dwight. Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs] [to Ryan] [makes clicking noises like sh**ting a g*n] Hey! [in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... . Okay! Everybody! Do not panic! Safety partners. [in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright. [in phone] No, no. Finish the... Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides! Go, let's go. This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow! Oh, you say that every time. Oh, boy... Alright, let's go, let's go. Come on, you're safety partners! You're safety partners! I'm okay! Let go of me! Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That's rule number two. Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower. Uh, okay, two? Okay... uh, sorry? ...I don't. Um, yeah. Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges. Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game. I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code. I guess. Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight. Nice. Smart. ...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene... [to Dwight] Don't... Come on, egghead. Let's do it. Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer? Okay. Yes! It was a trick question. Okay, Dwight. You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about. For instance, why don't you go to business... I am. Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will. Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie. Sometim... . Who goes to business school? He does? You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'. You should tell him. What? You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them. Yeah. You're right. Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So... What's that? Yeah. Uh, I better tell somebody. [to fireman] Excuse me, sir... Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh. Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school. Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan? Toaster Oven 101? Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a f*re. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans. [singing] Ryan started the f*re! It was always burning--- [sing gibberish to "We Didn't Start the f*re"] [singing] Ryan started the f*re! It was always burning... I'm really sorry, Dwight. What? Was it worth it? I'm really sorry, Dwight. The f*re guy! The f*re guy! Oh, man. Okay, I have to f*re somebody. Oh, yeah. What are you? A monk? Well, I don't really have two heads. So... Who do you think it should be? No, Jim brings in money. Eh. It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to f*re the least popular because it has the least effect on morale. [turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who? You're right, I didn't even think of him. Yeah, that's actually a really good idea. Yeah... I could. I'm not saying that's what he said. [listening to his head] What? That is not a very nice thing to say about him. Are you kidding? I agree. He'd land on his feet. Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay. No. To the. So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it? Ahh, come on. I don't wanna f*re Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away] [whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number? Oh. [fixes his dress] Jim... Oh, God. Fantastic! What?! That would've solved all my problems. Oh, you idiot. If you left, I wouldn't have to f*re anybody. Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back? You can call. Can you call 'em? That is weird. Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk. Okay, calm down. Where was the last place you saw it? I think you should retrace your steps. Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot, hot, very hot. [On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model. I know. Uh, yeah, ream. Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work. [On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list. Hold on one second... Umm... You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks. Was that your mom? Oh, I thought it was your mom. Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool. Ok. Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist? No I'm not. umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt] Ok, say please. Please? Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou. Could you practice on the forms? Ok, Roy? Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen. Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link. You know a ton of fourteen year old girls? Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'... ... he cried at the end of it. He did. Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid? Ok, here we go. Alright, come on. Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh! Yeah. [Jim opens office door for Michael] Thank you. Yes. Hi-yah! Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight. Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you. No, Really? Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22. me punching you and you hitting the floor. Really? No, they must have class. Look... Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright? Shi mate! What the hell was that? No. Alright, that's the way you want it. I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him. I got his pants. Ok, break. Break. You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. [Michael is using his head guard to h*t Dwight] Eight points. Nine points. [Begins to hock a loogie] Open your mouth. [knock at the door] Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya? Ok, to what? This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute? I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that? And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager. I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it. No, no, title change only. No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now. Absolutely but not really. Yes you do. Ok, let's do this thing. [to Pam] Wish us luck. Oh yeah- Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy. Dwight- Do you want to play- Sir, you have some messages. They're important. "I love you". That's from me. Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk! Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of "Oklahoma" in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good. Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight. Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter g*n and sh**t the- Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet? I forget it, brutha. Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops. D-W-I-G-H-T. Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so- Goin'. Ok. Where we goin'? Doesn't matter. Goin' to the go go. [nervous laugh] Oh-ok. Hello, Dwight. Who. Uh, no, no, no Gould. This is none of your affair because she is your boss- No. Thank you. Done. S'ok. You're not having sex. Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that? Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again. [plays Jan's message] "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you". Ok. We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders. No, we don't. Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease. I win. Wait, wait; one thing. Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right? 15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a... No, that was unbelievable. You didn't see it? "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?" Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. [to Jan] That happens occasionally. Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it? Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. Alright, next suggestion. Arrr, dooby dooby do. "You need to do something about your B.O." Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about t*nk. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. "You need to do something about your coffee breath"- Ok. Let's keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow. Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion. "Don't sl-", ok, that's blank [Dwight picks up note] Don't, just put it- Where did you get your outfit? Look- Oh my God... No, Dwight; come in. What do you want Dwight? You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave. Why on earth would we give you a raise? You do? How do you get in? Oh! Michael, for God sakes! Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that? That was deer!? Gross, oh! Oh, did not! No. Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you. [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light? That's from Superman? [Jim bows to Pam; she bows back] Thank you. Yes. AH! Guh-oood. Please don't do that. I can't tell you. I don't have to tell you anything. Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr! That's strong! I'm not going get a brain- Stop it. Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose. I gotta erase a lotta stuff. A lot of stuff. I know. Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with. One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental. Who do you think he should choose? Ummmm... [to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes! Thank you! Oh, uh, no. Could- Could, keep that down. Because not everybody knows about the party. Umm, Michael. Because it's a surprise. Uh hmm. So, don't tell. Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hangin' tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy. That's, whatever stupid show you want- We're watching it. I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight. You, too, Dwight? Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention. We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy. Hey, you must be Dwight! Hey, I love the Birkenstocks. Uh hmm. Oh, uh, later-ish. [singing] Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore. Here we are. Oh god. No, no, turn it around. You'll break it. All right. Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! [laughs] Nice, huh? On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three. One, two, three. [they lift and start to move a desk] Do we have one? Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work. That makes sense because he has elfish features. It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan. I know how to plug something in. I think the tree looks nice. Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth." Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of .. Yep. That's exactly what happened. There's a little more to it. What? Oh, sh**t. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right? Should we just keep opening up the presents? And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice? That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen. Damn it. I really want the iPod. [opens present] "In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute." Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod? I never said it was better than an iPod. Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand. That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, sh**t. Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories. Got to be kidding me. I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it? Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck. Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you? You don't even drink tea. Okay .. I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't. Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to. Hey. I don't know. I'm in. Hey. What's up, buddy? Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good. Who, Steve? Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup. Um, I don't think so, I just bought it. I love these. Oh, there it is. J1. Here, you know what? You can have some nickels. Hello, everyone. The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship. Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... [to Stanley] We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan. So, okay. Okay... Uh... usually it's a woman. Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you! Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing. Hey, come inside and talk to me. Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm. Okay. Wow! Never, ever, ever give up. [panicked] No one wants to pick me up!? I'm not sick! I'm b*rned! Oh... Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight. Ha ha ha. So where are you shipping... No, your job is being my friend, Pam. OW! God! What? No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot. What? Part of your duties are to what? You just said "part of your duties are to" something. Yes, you did. What is wrong with you? How strange. Because they always have yams. You've seen one of these? Roy gave it to me for Christmas. I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it. Really? Oh! Ha, haha. Uh, ow. Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN! Really? Yeah. Throw it. I promise it won't break. Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player] What?! That is so cool. Thanks Dwight! No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you? It's alright. [sigh] I b*rned my foot!!! Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there! Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins. I, barely know him... Slowly, slowly. Let's just get to the elevator. What are you doing? What, stop... [Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop. You can't lay down. Wake up. [sprays Dwight] I'm just gonna get... Get up, get up. Just keep him awake. I know. I know. I just want to say goodbye ok? Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different. It's just hard to explain. Oh my goodness! Come here. Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around. Come on, get inside. Dwight, what are you drinking? Oh my God, Dwight, put that down. Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight] Give the bottle to Michael! Give it to me. Dwight... [to Jim] You just keep your eyes on the road. [to Dwight] Give me the bottle or you're fired. Give it to me Dwight. Michael stop. Stop [sprays Michael] Stop spraying me! Gimme the bottle! Dwight, what is your middle name. Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight] Hi Dwight. [to Dwight] So, I'm ordering a CAT scan. Does the skin look red and swollen? Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off. Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up. We'll, see you when you get out. Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog? Gotcha! [laughing] Oh, God. [low] Crap! Nothin' how ya doing? Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring? Anything. They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind. Well I say that an empty desk means a... No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say. He's out sick. Whhh... What are you guys doing? Yes. On a Friday? [Dwight nods] I will do all the talking. Hi, Oscar its Michael. Yeah, I feel terrible about it. I feel nauseous and my heads k*lling. I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish] He sounded sick. That's exactly what I was thinking. [singing] Can you hear me, they talk about us... Yeah, I think I can handle it. I think. [Michael presses a button for Stanley] Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it. Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen a little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy. Not so much. Nothing. Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets. Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material. Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is. Ok. Great. That's a communal bowl. Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know. Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle? Ok, it was the second one. I hate you. Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes. You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me. Ok. Who's this? Are you going to tell Michael? How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor. Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing. [as cleaning lady with mask leaves] Here she comes. All cleaned? Great. [walks into office] That is worse. [putting his feet on desk] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old bullpen. Don't ape me. This is great. The pressures of my office are insane. I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know? I used to sit right here. Yeah. You know who used to sit at that desk? Mm-mm. Todd Packer. Yeah. He was, but, uh... that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes. [whispering] Dwight. Let's send up Accounting. Hey, Dwight.Michael and [as they throw accountants' files and supplies around] Ahhhh! Whoo hoo! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Sales rules! Yeah! Oh ho ho [laughing] No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that. You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense. Stop. Stop it. [Dwight hangs up] Stop. It. [Dwight beings to dial] Don't. Don't. All right. Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good? Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on! God, this is gonna be fun. You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage. [in the background] So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone? What is? Let's just clap. Ready? [clapping] Yeah! Yeah! We have nowhere else Jan. This... Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months. Guys! Want to start unloading the truck? Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life. Ponies. How about rainbows? It totally sucks. No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what? But we get paid a lot less. Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO. Nope. The opposite of that. Ok, good. I probably will, why do you ask? Yeah. So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great. I dunno, it's onyourdesk. It was there when I sat down. This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey [points]. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? [walks over] OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were [Conan O'Brien walks in front of Michael], OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. [to camera] Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh. Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it. I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day. Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... [awkward silence] You can't f*re me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here. You need to get something for your girlfriend. Tightly wound? Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is. No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her. That you remember her. I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane. Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then... Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say. Ryan! Hey, Dwight. You all right Ryan? Pam! Cugino's pizza. That's what she said! Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon? Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year. That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act. When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'. That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time. But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company. Well, if you have a question, you should ask me. Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot. [stand up comic voice] But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class. Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? [stand up comic voice] The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs! I do. Both of them. Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars! You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them. It's unbelievable! Do we know anyone who was in the accident? Why would this affect our bonuses? Is Brad okay? Are we out of jobs? Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today. No. We're not. Which means absolutely nothing. Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go? Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip. You know I majored in Public Speaking in College. Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority. The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did. Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your ownbutI wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at. I hope you don't mind. The very best of luck to you, Dwight. Dwight, how we doing? Good luck. That is a tough crowd. [clapping] [clapping and cheering] [clapping and cheering] Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia. [claps] Alright. I got thirsty. How'd it go? You would not believe what happened here. Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35. Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.' Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.Jim and [under his breath] I work with a bunch of nerds. [to Sasha] Come on. [shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand. Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight. Do you have any computer games? Yeah, Meredith doesn't have any either. It's so lame here. Whatever, okay? That's your name? Mister Poop? Sure, Mister Poop. [Jake walks away] Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life. Dwight! Dwight! What the hell are you reading to them? What's a n*zi? Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't talk about n*zi in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it? [sighing] Why don't you just leave? Okay? You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business. That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to... I want to be on TV! Mister Poop, I have to tell you something. You're ugly. I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves]Michael and My theory is that... [Jim signals he's leaving, waves bye to Pam]Michael and [singing] ...The one they picked... the one you'll know by... don't you ever ask them why... if I told you would cry... you never look at them and sigh... and know they love you... One more time. [singing] You... [Dwight knocks on door] Yeah. Ohh, god. No no no, no, new suit, please. Thank you very much. It is from Italy. [checks jacket] Actually--- no, Bulgaria. Good luck. One of a kind. Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it. They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday. Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise. One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you? Where do we get those? Michael wants a strippergram? [eating donuts while Dwight plays the recorder] Stop it. Stop! What is that? Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything. If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week. What? [grinning] Ohhh, God. Ohhh, no. Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this. Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and... Okay. Thank you. Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please. It wasn't me. Uh, we don't make an eight foot sub. This is eight one foot subs. Uh, thirty-nine sixty. [pulls out wallet] Thirty nine... sixty. Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones. Get in here... everybody. What is this? And his favorite lunch. [making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing? [grabs cake] Oh. Thank you. What are--- it's... the party planning committee. Fine. Yes... [whispering] but don't expect any cookie. Are you done? ...Good. Okay. Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... [blows out the candles] ... I asked for trick candles. Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry. Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael. [sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by] Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey! Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight. You look cute today, Dwight. So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwightfindingdr*gs is more dangerous than most peopleusingdr*gs. [nods] Hey... And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said "Is it okay if I sip it?" and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way. Six. I go to a lot of parties. I am not giving you my keys. What's the hard way? Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow. Whoa. You are a volunteer. And that's not the same. [interrupting] Volunteer duty. [giggling] I wasn't attempting to compliment you. Uuf, well... [shakes head] Okay... I don't think Michael's ever done dr*gs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any. Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule. No, I have not. What are you implying? Okay. I'm done with this. He sure left in a hurry. I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime. Yes, it's marijuana. It's labeled. That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica. I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you. Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember. Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory? Now how do you know how it works? No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke? [presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face] I understand. Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble? Waa... what? What are you talking about? Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection. I can do that, it is my office. Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great. I'm not taking Rogaine. I don't take any prescription dr*gs. [Gives Dwight a knowing look] No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, "Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of dr*gs." The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate dr*gs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not. Yes, I will not be. Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you. We test a lot of urine. Oh, right. How are you? So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done. Just forget it. Just the urine. Just. I need your urine. Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight. It's none of your business. Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring. I need clean urine for the lady. A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens. Do you want to give Michael your urine? You're not going to get my permission on this. Yeah. Maybe. Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much. What's wrong? Where's your costume? Why? Wha... Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch. Yes, sir. Here's your badge. No, I don't have a g*n. Good. No. Oh. Uh...[awkwardly salutes] Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you. Two. Okay... [removes glasses] [leaving the room] Excuse me. Clown paint. Are you sure? [looks at Oscar, who is front of the camera, holding the baby poster in front of his chest] Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago. And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it. Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it. Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together. [to Dwight, who is sitting in front of the camera] Smile. No. This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go. Oh. What did I write? Talk to Michael. I gave him the box. Uh. Dwight. Okay! Calm down. Hey, hey! Stop. Okay... Dwight... Stop... Oh... kay... Okay. Yes. Mm-hmm. [picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security thr*at? You have till five. Maybe Stanford would be cool. Yeah. Maybe we should both go. Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later. Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work. Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week? Come on, everybody. Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two? It's a nice tux. Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert. I can always kind of win at roulette. Yeah. Mind control. Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind. It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things. Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene] Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration. That's a shawl. Well, actually, it's my warehouse. Why are you here? Oh, well... Kiss. [Michael kisses her on the cheek, pauses and then kisses her on the other cheek] That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight [Kisses cheeks] Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson. I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling. Um... Hey. What... Jan's here. Come on, Dwight. Good evening, Dwight. What is this? Then roll an eight. Good luck, Dwight. Let it ride. Let it all ride. The point is four. sh**t, roll it. Four! So close. So close. What? No, I... I didn't... I don't know... Three queens. No, that's a flush. Hey, wait. [train whistle blowing] Not it.[ The Accountants, Webisode 10 - "The Best Day of My Life" ] Well, we've asked everyone else. We asked her. She said she didn't do it. I believe she didn't do it. Are you doubting me? Oh, my God. How did he afford that new waterbed he's always bragging about? That's not true. Are you really gonna marry him? [Pam nods] ...Ok. Can you tell who's gay and who's not? What about Oscar? Well, heis. [deep sigh] There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else. Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman. I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you? Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them. That's ridiculous. [sighs] Let's call him and get the website. Well, they're sold out. Michael, Dwight's looking at gay p*rn on his computer. [looking at gay p*rn] Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay p*rn, straight p*rn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually... it is quite beautiful. That sounds great. No one else in this office is gay. [sobbing] I'm sorry I called you f@ggie. You're not f@ggie. You're a a good guy. I was going to quit. But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gill and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay. [Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body] What are you doing?! Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled sex romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo. But I don't understand. It's for managers. I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. [A long silence.] Are you still there? Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker. Um. Okay, um. You got that? Write it down. I got it. Andrea's the office b*tch. You'll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed. Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too! Hey! No, it's not. I did. Yep. If I weren't engaged, I would so h*t that. Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much. Oh, hey! And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time. I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic. That is crooked on that side. All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up. Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin. All right. So maybe. See ya. Because he's afraid to fly. Yep. Yeah, she's up front. I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello? I need you to do something for me. I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic. Okay. And? Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip. You're welcome. Michael. Okay! Excellent. Oh... Shut it. [answering phone] Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. [to others] Say hi to Pam!Jim, Josh, and You first. Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products. Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael's black light on] Ha, ha, ha. Whoa. What are those stains? Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Yes! [walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello? Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs. You know she has it out for him now. That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart! Dwight, you should be running this office. It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her. [laughing] Yeah. [answering the phone] Hello? Who is this? You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other. What about him? It's not about a surprise party is it? Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back. How do you know I like that store? How do you know that? No it's not. It's officially not. ...noted. Ok. Ouchy. Three hours, wow. Have fun. [Dwight walks away staring through the blinds at Michael] Yeah. New blouse? Halter top? Camisole? Teddy? Really? Ok. What would you do differently? Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers. The decision to turn on Michael was difficult. [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So [cutting his food, giving Jan a "so there" look], here we are. It's all, on the table. I want... the branch. And I await your decision. Hey Dwight. Do you want an M&M? No seriously. You should have an M&M, they're really good. They're good, huh? Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in. Sounds like a good dentist. What's his name? Your dentist's name is Crentist. Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist. Let me see your teeth. Let me see 'em. Let me see 'em. You should... floss. [in Michael's office] Wow, this is tough. Ohhhh. Arrrgggh! Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um... she demoted me. Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job! And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally. Yep, I did. I did. But I think... you should do it. [exhales] Perfect, well, we're settled. All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager. Ohh.. Well... I guess we should go tell the troops. Congratulations Dwight. Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty? It's really happening! We can make a difference here. You alone? Because I thought together we could--- Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring. It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it. What? But you said you liked it. You've always admired it. [Michael finally breaks] Take it back. That's my car. THAT'S MY CAR. I know, Dwight. I know. I know. I know. Jan called me about your little meeting! I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight. Oh do you? Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?! How dare you, Dwight? Give me one good reason why I should f*re you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?! Not. Good. Enough! I have a laundry machine! I don't know if I can trust you anymore. All right, I'll be right back. [goes down pretend stairs] [hands Ryan pencil] There you go. You're welcome. Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute. [goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from Stanley's desk] What? Oh my God. You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated. [clears throat] So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this... What are you doing? I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out. Hi. I do not wanna talk about this. We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move... I think that is a great way to honor Ed. Life-size. DEAD. Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a sh*t? Was its heart b*ating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying] [seeing bird] Oh, God! Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ... Oh shhhh--oot! No, he's not. No, he's not. [cradling bird next to face] Ugh, no that thing isdead. I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight? What are... What are you doing? No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!? I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute. Is it for the bird? I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box] If you wanna do something for the funeral... Maybe you could play a song on your recorder. Do you have it with you? And we know how he d*ed. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song. [quickly] Amen. Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown. A dime and a nickel. But the other one is. I've heard that before. Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother. He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted. It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole. It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five. Yeah. Yes. I'm very excited. I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited. So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office? Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too. I know where we're not. [looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh... Come on. I don't think you know what you're saying. Uh huh. Gotcha. Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor. I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship. Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back. Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it. Yeah. All right! Thank you! Who was that? Is that your Cousin Mose? Yes. Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore. Outsourcing and consolidation of competition. Depression? You're a freak! Um, loneliness. Maybe women. No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over. OK. No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye. Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice. Where are all the animals? Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled. Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call. Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal? Wait, can you go back? Ok, I'm going to establish time frames. I'm going to put everything in terms of "real dollars". I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers. Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing. They really didn't like me. I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan. I just feel kind of tired, you know. Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right? She looks like Pam from the neck down. Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... ' Okay. Spoiler... alert. I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean? I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] "Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight." Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast. Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please. Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can. All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at Dwight] Let's go. Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup. Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch. No... way. No. There's no one else. Still. Okay, okay. Um... Why? You sent him cards? You never met him. Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that. I will improvise. I will speak from the heart. All right. Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace? Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work? Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings. [no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that. Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay? Don't touch me this time. Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? No. Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few. The office. Anything? What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under? [pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go. That was hilarious. The foam ... Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good. Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one. God, Dwight! What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car. Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore! What?! We did it? We did it. We did it!Michael and Right here! Right here! [pounds his chest against Dwight's]Michael and Yeah, baby! We did it! How did we do it? That's great! Because he accomplished something. About seven. Well, that has wheels. Really, Dwight? How fast are you? Really? I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther. Oh, I'll just time him later. Yeah. Are you ready? Go! Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to b*at Toby. Here... Who's here? Yes, please. Karen Filip... [In Italian voice] Ka-ren Fili-pell-li. Who's next? Andy Bernard. Saint Bernard. What? I'm not... I'm not f*ring somebody on the first day. No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner. Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr. Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand. Hey, Dwight. Okay. Sounds good. I don't know what you're talking about. No. Looks good. I'm not. I am. Right. Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales. Umm, on the contrary. And I'm a director. Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film? [talking to himself] I present the orientation video. Not now. I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale. It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one. I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok? Work it out amongst your selves! Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company? Will you? Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'. So check out how we liveMichael & They call it Scranton. The Electric City. Scranton. The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider. You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot, But the little cars go in the compact spotMichael and Hey, buddy. Anything new to report? I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just. [laughs hysterically] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor. Okay! Okay! Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this! Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up. Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay. Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you. Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight. Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires. Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators. So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two. Yeah, it does, actually. Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks. Shut it... Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon? Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese. Actually, it is. It's Latin for "earth." Yeah. Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back. Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came. Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University. If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm. [coughs word] Idiot! [coughs sentence] Nice comeback! Just... try to be cool. Okay, are you cool, really? Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. [Dwight starts to run] No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool! Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. t*nk. Merry Christ--[looks up] NO! Why... why did you bring that here? Dwight, what uh... Well, get it out of here. Merry Christmas Dwight. Wow. What have we got here? Dead goose. All right. Oh, Dwight, we talked about this. No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead. Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it k*lled. Wow. Win-Win. Dwight, you cannot keep that here. Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour. It's a dead animal in an office. You can't... I'm sorry. I would like it off my desk. If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her. That's not fair. I don't need to know. Take it from Toby. What are you doing? ["Goodbye My Lover" by James Blunt plays] Carol? Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to "Goodbye My Lover" on computer] I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it. I think that's a really good option... You can't do that. Umm... I'm number three. Yeah, but I'm number three. OK, I think I can help here. As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now. Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.] Permission denied. So she looks really hot, so I said, "You look hotter than usual today." [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table. Yes. Carol used to drink lattes. She would get this little foam mustache... And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, that's not funny. She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy --- Michael! Repeat what you said louder! No. Oh, yeah... Maybe. No, it's Usuba. Actually, the Usuba's the better Kn*fe when you're working with this quantity. [on cell phone to Dwight] I need to know if I can start the party? Did Michael give you permission to do this? This is great. Oh, [points to Cindy] she's asleep. I... don't know, it has four bed rooms and a loft... And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it. Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party. Did you have fun at Benihana's? [Karen and Pam enter] Dwight, you won the raffle! [holds out gift] Open it! Open it ! Open it! [Dwight rips open present. Angela is upset and Pam notices] Do you like it? Can I talk to you a second? [singing] Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya... Merry Christmas. [singing] I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum. Ohh... [laughs] All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this? For what? Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing? You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office. Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a Kn*fe! No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic Kn*fe to Stanley's neck?! [picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet. Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly... Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies. I have a special assignment for you. A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess." Not important. OK, forget it. She bought it? [Pam nods] OK. OK. [to Jim and Ryan] Michael h*t a deer? There an accident? Somebody hurt? Definitely. There are copies in the bathroom? Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life. What? No, it's not... it's nothing. Yeah. [Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here. Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam's desk] So that just leaves Dwight and Jim. Dwight? Here ya go. [throws laundry] It's just... brrrrrr... It's "Amazing Race," Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it. Seriously? You're going to sit in the back? Mind? Nothing would delight me more. You still do that thing? After you sir. Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will att*ck you from the front. 'Kay. 'Kay. Yeah, sure, go ahead. Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked. We have discount prices on ink cartridges... And, also, any forms that you are going to need... We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys. Please keep holding, your call is very important to us. Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up] Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three. Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence. We should go on a double date. Big deal. Where were you this morning? Why do you lie, liar? It sure seems like he is lying. I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing. Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard. Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day. How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business. I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world. 'Kay. Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome. Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy? No, he was not. He was a total douche. Doompity-doomp. Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had. I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting. professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia. I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me. How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable. There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon. You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work. Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one. Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking. Really comin' down out there. Commute's gonna be hell. So um, where were you workin' before this? What kind of company is that? I never heard of 'em. Sure? Okay. Hey. What's up? Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did. Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize. How's this place treating you? Oh, well. No. I'm sure. So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please. Welcome back. Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. [looks around the room] Not bad, huh? And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? [hands broom to Dwight, though Oscar thinks he's handing it to him] Hello son. If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead. Life is a road--- To jump start a car, first pop the hood. Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine. Then you take these and clip them wherever. [Dwight is wearing a bra] You just twist your hand until something breaks. And remember no matter what, I will always love you. He's not going to be a m*rder. You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no? Okay. From the top. Ready? Three- Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh! [Spanks himself] Gay. Absolutely not. Well get on it. And make it happen. Stop. That's disgusting. Fine. Sally. Blonde. Have you ever seen a stripper before? I'm Elizabeth, I'm the dancer that was requested. I'm the stripper. [Phone rings] Oh God. Guys, beef! It's what's for dinner! Who wants some man meat? Yeah she probably, yeah she would be. You know what, okay, excuse me. Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music. This is wrong, this is wrong! This is wrong! I have a girlfriend. And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay. Shame on you. Go back to work! You want me to answer phones with my clothes on. Wow. Thank you. Chocolate! Where did you acquire it? That is a delicacy in the Amazon but it has not yet been imported to the United States. Joseph the 2nd. Fredrick Wilhelm the 3rd. Why the tyrant King George, of course! So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep? Ben Franklin. And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice. Which rhymed. Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't. Both. That's why I invented the bifocal. Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid? [Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid? [Windows reboot sound] Altoid? [Windows reboot sound] Mint Dwight? Inbwit? Yes. What are you doing? What? Unbelievable. Hi, Dwight. Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left! Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'. You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers. Did you ever see that movie? Of course I saw it. You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out. [whispers to father] That's ok. [Albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking] Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. [to Albert] Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too. I don't have that, Dwight. Who? Oh, I... I don't... I'm not sure. Okay, Okay. Where are we going? Come... Come on! Dwight, just... Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song. Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you? "Don't be an idiot." Changed my life. ....Dude. Dwight, what are you doing? Oh my God! I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it. Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six. I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd... Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel. What? ... No. It b*rned me. I... bizarre. No... no. One crisis at a time. The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding. I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I sh*t one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog. Sure. Okay. Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family! So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control? Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight. Goodbye Jim. And good luck. How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh? Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh! Can you confirm that the straps are tight? MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don't see how he can. Alright. Another worm? Like, are they friends? No, no. Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless? Is anybody else in the... Ok. Beauty. Thank you sir! Thank you. Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me. I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that. Yes. Oh, um, potato salad. No thank you, Roy. Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please. No. Thank you. About 5,000. Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate. David, how much did this house cost? I'll show you around. I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station. Uh, that's a guest room. [phone rings] Oh. I must get that. You'll have to excuse me. Uh, yes. [takes duck back] Yes. I don't know, it was here when I was born. I don't know. I don't know. Where to begin? My ball. Ok. [screams in pain] Ahh God! Pam, please call security! Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy. Thank you. Okay. Um... Got you something. You don't know what it is. It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead. That would have made us even, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even Steven. Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna... Which is where? Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something. Boy I--- I know. What's what? Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice... honor. Dwight. Dwight. I've been doing some very interesting reading. Mm-hmm. Tales of bravery. Mm-hmm. I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together. Hey guys! Guess who's back! [Dwight pepper-spray's Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD! No need to thank me. Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight. How's it goin' man? Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna. Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug. You guys... [half-heartedly] Andy! Nah, that's too far. The baler can flatten a car engine. It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a b*at. They use props. They use visual A*DS, and they just made us look like dopes. I don't know, I don't know. Because you know what our k*ller is? Depression--- Nn--- Depression. Yes. Ryan, well done. Two minutes, forty-two seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said "awesome" 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies. Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or... Go buy some watermelons. I don't know this place as well as I thought I did. I'm getting cleaned out. Let's do it! Drop that sucker. BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh... crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess. Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes. Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler. Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster. I'm on it! Thank you. Anything. You mean a moon bounce. I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash. Do you, do you want a drawbridge? Un-shun. Yeah that sounds good. Re-shun. Yes, thank you for seeing that. I don't know if I wanna do this. No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking. Rock n' roll! That's right! I am not thinking. Yes! Yeah! Woo! Woo! I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point! [Dwight continues air guitar] Whoa! What's the situation? Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end? Is it nice outside? Do I need my jacket? Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T? Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go! Let's go! [on the roof] My life! Oh, my life... Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression. Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit su1c1de every year! According to a 2004 study! Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil! Wait, where are the warehouse guys? Okay... that's... That's the whole point, dummy. Okay. If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it. If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be averyrich dude. Oooooh, my life! Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed. Oh my God, thereisa castle. Dwight, find out what the present is. Dwight, what are you--- [Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question. What kind of bear is best? False. Black bear. Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica. Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Uh, four dollars. And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble. And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars. ... MICHAEL! Everybody in here. STAT. No time to lose. Cri-Man-Squa. F and C, doubletime. No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference. No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves. OK, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice. On it. OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair. Put the most attractive beets on top. The ones that make you pull the car over and go, "Wow, I need this beet right now." Those are the money beets. Hi, uh--- Scranton Times. Chad Lite, "Lighter Side of Life." And obits. Oh... Uh, yeah, I'd like uh, uh--- When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment. And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first. I don't care! It was disgusting. Cartoon characters having sex? OK... Mm-hmm. "Hello. I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that." That's how devoted I am to this job. I know. I understand that, Dwight. Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut? Sweet. Hey, Dwight. You look really nice today. Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp. [Dwight imitates the "Jim face"] Look at that. Spot on. [Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this? [reads demerit] "Jim Halpert, tardiness." Ugh. I love it already. Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean? Lay it on me. Now that sounds serious. Which would be me. OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation. Oh, my God. [on speakerphone] You got it, Jan. [exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house. OK. This is the lastthingthat Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight. Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say. [raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces? Phallus? Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] "Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute." This is ridiculous. Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting. See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight? Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one? That is not current. Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls. OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie. I have to know whether you're serious or not. I wish I could menstruate. OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go! Yeah. Uh, Phyllis got a good look. Hmm. I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today. This guy looks like a real deviant. Aye, aye, Cap'n. Many womenarecompetent drivers. [scraping] OK. Come on. Think we'll find him? [pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies? Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot. Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera. [sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. "Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?" You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all. Hey, Dwight. It's Jim. No, you're not. I'm looking right at you. Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator. I saw him two minutes ago. In the women's bathroom, above the sink. Ughh... Blech. Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying... Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.] Maybe. About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned. Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner! Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off. Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley. not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something. I'm not playing. We are going to choose team names. Dwight? Really? Not Slytherin? I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort. [starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left. Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore. You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race. That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team. [off screen] Pam...you're missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook] Turkey is a healthy meat. The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright? 13 hot dogs, everybody! [holding a fish with all the meat stripped off] Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs! What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich? I knew you were saying sabotage. I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane. If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see. One. Two. Three. Excellent! I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words. Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad. Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle] One, two, three, go! Don't, don't. Wow. Go, Dwight. Keep moving. I'm not going to give it to you. Michael, do something! Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us. [breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh... [knock on door] Yeah. Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute. Okay. Uh... Uh, okay. Stop crying. I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time. No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome. [smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor. Oh hey, Dwight. Does my room have cable? Can I change rooms? Can I have a late checkout? You're not the manager even in your own fantasy? Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil? Go. Eighty thousand dollars a year. [signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view. No. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you this, it isnotbecause of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is... emotionally magnificent. All right, you guys. See you later, wish us luck! Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck] I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche... Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care. Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye. White, because it contains all other colors. You make a chair, but you don't sit on it. The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell. Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended. my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous. Damn it! Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck. I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy... is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep. Hail to the chief! accept. Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the "motorboat" noise] "Brbrbrbrbr!" also? Thank you. Really? You will be your own assistant. Okay. So... you would be the Regional Manager,andthe Assistant Regional Manager. Andy is your number two. I would be the Secret Assistant Regional Manager. Mm-hmm. [laughs] Mm. Yeah. [raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck? So tenthousandof your dollars is worth one real dollar? Amen. [raises hand] Do we have to? No, we're letting Jan go. [at the same time as Dwight] Trees. [at the same time as Dwight] Forest. Liquid. I don't want it. Make it 100. No. In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again. The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns. That's it! Class is canceled, everybody out! I'm punishing them. What--- What are you winking for? It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall. This is gonna look so awesome! Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. "Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoe in." Well, got down there. I nailed the interview. And the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black? That's stupid. [to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin' on that coffee. Dwight, hello.
