No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. [zips his lips] Like that. No. [grabs cell phone off desk] Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek. What? No, yeah, I think that's a good idea. What color do you guys think? Phyllis wanted red, I didn't. God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this? Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time. No. Oh, yeah right. It was you. Um, it's kind of private. This is a little character I like to do [places a green turban with a yellow feather on his head], it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters. [puts an envelope to his head] Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse. [tears open envelope and pulls out card] "Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin." Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk.[Phyllis catches Dwight trying to sneak into the girls bathroom] No, no, no, no... ...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think. No, why were you in there?! What were you doing in there? We are going to have two men's rooms. Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual. What? I told them busiest...idiots. Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR. No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother. I don't know about that. They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. [to Phyllis] C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on. Oooh! I'm not worried. So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone? Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis. This is not a test! Can you leave?! DO YOU WANT TO DIE? Okay. Phyllis. ...Jim. Definitely, definitely, Jim. Um... Oscar's kind of cute. I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch. Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me? I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars. Alright, let's get this started. I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones. [reading the screenplay] Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. Catherine Zeta Jones enters. Not now! Ok, what are they? Tom. Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom. Hey Phyllis, come here for a second. Have you heard anything about any secret office romances? Ok, see you later. Nice job, Bill. Not. Surprise! [laughs] Everybody! Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights? Not great. Oh hey, for me. What is in here? [opens a handmade oven mitt] Oh, come on. The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week. Hey. Good morning, Michael. Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace. How about the anchor? Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck. Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan? Can I have everyone's attention please? Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question? Do you all know what it's like to be disabled? Oscar? Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me. [counting cash] Seventy, eighty, one, two three. Eighty-three dollars. Still a lotta money and I'm going to ... [moves money after seeing workmen walk by] ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it. I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest. Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we? Great. Phyllis? [disbelieving] Really? I've seen some of your spreadsheets. Stay or... Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way. All right. Let's talk about clothing. Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means... I'm divorced. I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff. "Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration." Guess what? Bye. [Jim leaves] Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue? Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later. [generalized clapping and cheering] Congratulations. Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she... Let's get the party started. Not the way I taught you! [Michael joins in] Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority. Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her] How do you know that? It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of dr*gs is something to laugh about. Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out. Yeah? Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent. Off. Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise? Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee. And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him. Yeah... Yes, that's the problem. Okay, well... all settled, then. What box?! Okay. No, I mean Afghanistanis with A*DS. What? All-in. Good Luck, honey. Nice, very nice. Oh, man! Yes! Yes, he did, actually. About three weeks ago.[ The Accountants, Webisode 02 - "Phyllis" ] You did? Well, how much was that? We're talking more like $3,000. No. We didn't think it was. Okay. Thank you, Phyllis. What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine! But still, Phyllis, in college? Did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do! [laughing] Right! [serious] And I take that as a compliment. Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7. If you do that, you're going to have to put out. What was Dwight thinking? That he could turn Jan against me? She's my ex-lover! ...ish. It'ssosexy. You look so hot. Hey, hi, hello. Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news. I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight. Thank you Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black! With ferocity! I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager. Yes, I am. It's very sad. Because he was my boss. Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam. Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's. [upset] Do you think that this is a game? [Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing? Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael? I... I said are you ready TO PARTY! Okay. Where are we going? Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky? [looks around, noticing that no one is working] Wha... what's going on here? Yes! [hugs Angela] Cool. Really? Where did you hear that? Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis. Uh, what's that smell? Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home. Oh, you know. Never... .never mind. I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume. It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells. Who's Bob Vance? When do people work? How are we going to get home? Michael, it's freezing out. Exactly. Thank you, Jim. Fine! [everybody stops talking] Have your party. Just no guests. Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch. This should've been up yesterday. [refers to party flyer] One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal. Phyllis? Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis. Darryl! Darryl! Darryl! [Darryl exits break room and passes Phyllis] Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... [looks inside conference room] meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party. You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie] Huh? [puts on jacket] [whispers] The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame. Give me it. I am not. What are the ingredients of poi? Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior. Just bragging rights. Come on!! Bueno. Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon? I don't know. Who knows how words are formed. Yeah, thank you. Thanks. That was fun. Thank you. That's nice. Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay? Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close. No. Sorry. Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride. There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin. How you doin'? You excited. Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight? You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous... Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle? Here, let me... Just cover up that bald patch. And do you, Phyllis, take Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration, to be your lawfully wedded husband? Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning. Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers. Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter? I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back. Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember. Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo. Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery. Okay. So you and Bob are looking at a historical house? Mm, how many bedrooms? [on phone] Absolutely. I couldn't be more sorry about this. [door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right? What? Really? [to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened? I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things. That - it's the same thing. Yes. What, um... what do you think of role-play? OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt. She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles. That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know. I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan. Phyllis. What do you think? Too much? Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat! Defcon twenty. She wants to get back together. Very good. Karen. She looks corporate. Those little pants suits. Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
