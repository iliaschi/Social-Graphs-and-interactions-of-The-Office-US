I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me. Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember? Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer. Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on. Oh, yeah. She's hot. Hey. Sure. No. I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food. He literally won't come out of his office. You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic. OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? a**l fissures? Yeah, but no one here has it. Someone has it. I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... [spots Michael through the blinds] There he is. Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey? Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone... I love their sandwiches too. I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box. Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right. No. That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin. Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope. That's disgusting. Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. [takes off sweater to reveal tuxedo] I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may h*t a bump and spill the drink! Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today. She would have definitely slept with me. There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh... [points at Phyllis] Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin. Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner. Yes, your corner. Go. I do not understand what you spend your money on. Yeah. Oh my God! Wait, this goes back two years. [flicks football onto Kevin's desk] OH! Yes! So close. I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game. Yeah. Why? Hey, do you guys have any other games? [sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something. Wow! All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do? Um, not neccessari... Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen. Is there anybody else. No. It's gonna be fun. This is great. [Angela shakes her head] Oh. Who is your emergency contact? [Ryan's phone rings] Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man. He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man. Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny. Word. They are not. Yes, they are. [Jan hangs up] That's my girlfriend. No, they just made out. That's it. Don't talk about it. Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved. Yep, right after you. Apres-vous. [mouths to Pam] No calls. There's no time to think about if this is real. Just, shh, everybody. [knock at the front door] The problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother. There's always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler. Yeah. Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight? Where are you off to? Ok, alright. That's ok. It's ok. Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together, you know? Like people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on. Did it work? A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year. You guys should use a hand truck. I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain. So Phyllis is basically saying, "Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth." I gave Ryan an iPod. Last gift. Kevin. I want the foot bath. Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance? No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.Phyllis, Meredith, Michael, Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up. [looking at Xeroxed butt pictures] Whose butt is that? You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that. There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell 'em that? A*DS. [low] No, damn it! What does what mean? I agree it's unacceptable. [longing look] [Michael messes up hair to look like Jim's] Expenses. No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig? It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy. Oh ho! Which one is Pam? Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting. Oh, God! How could that happen? How could... right in the middle of the carpet. Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office. Check it out. Check it out. Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee. What is it? What is it? No, just tell me what it is. Open the door up! Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing. Thanks for the head's up, Kev. Sweet. I hate that too. Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. [points] We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here. [on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye. It's from Bob. No, it's not. [walks away] Join the club. So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions? What is that? [coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest. Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman? You are the future! This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's. Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one [types]. Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at. Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods] Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date. Did you hear anything yet? Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out? Second opinion on what? Skin cancer is treatable. [singing] Happy birthday dear Michael, [Michael joins in, Kevin's phone rings] Happy birthday... [everyone but Dwight stops] ...tooo youuuu. Kevin? Respect the birthday please. There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover. Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is. [mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day. ...It's something to think about. Kevin. You heard anything yet? Okay. Well. Live strong. Push. Good! That's great. You got it. [Kevin's phone rings] Excuse me. Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos. slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation. [fake coughing] Narc! Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out. Narc! Narc! Kevin? Kevin, what prescription dr*gs are you taking, besides Rogaine? What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means] We just need urine, sir. No. Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable. There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them. Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer. Give me the dice. Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins. Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling] Wow. I think you're bluffing. Oh. Three nines. Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael? I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker. Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play. Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again? She took you down, huh? Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock. Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding? Whatever. I'm in charge of the music. Sweet. All right. It is not an accounting error. Well, it's not my accounting error. Obviously we do need to find it quickly to ensure that it's not a criminal action. Me, too. You guys wanted to see me? So, I know the answer's probably "no," but did you take any money, or buy anything with company money or anything like that? It will never happen again. My boyfriend, Bob Vance, from Vance Refrigeration gave me a Vance Refrigeration credit card. Only for emergencies. You don't use it to buy refrigerators, Kevin! It's better to be embarrassed by the truth now, then to go to jail for it later. Please. If I stole $3,000, I wouldn't be here. I'd be on a beach in Jamaica drinking Red Stripe. Sure. Somebody stole some money. That is fantastic. How much did they get? $3,000. Thank you. Really, genius? [sighs] All right. Who should we ask next? You know, my mom picks the worst times to visit. Well, my mom's in town, but a bunch of my friends are in town, too, and we were going to go watch The Prince of Tides. Well, we don't like it. We make fun of it. It's like a Rocky Horror Picture thing we do. Can we focus, please? Maybe it was someone in the warehouse. Roy wouldn't do it. He wouldn't do it. He has too much character. I do not. That is inaprobable... inappropriate. Stop it! Stop it right now! Kevin... Kevin, you guys don't know anything. We don't think it was you. Well, I mean, how would I do that even if I wanted to? Well, I don't even know where that is. Isn't it locked? Well, I'm satisfied. So, thank you very much for your time, Roy. You don't have to answer that one. We don't know that. Oh, come on. Yes. She said she didn't do it, then 45 minutes later the conversation ended. Fine. I'll write it. No. Fine. I'll supervise. The date should be right-justified. [keys pounding] Right-justified, not left-justified. Do you know what "justified" means? "To whom it may concern?" Really, Kevin? Really? Thank you, it's just easier this way. It's got to be it. You gambled petty cash? That's not the point. How are we supposed to believe you didn't take the other $3,000? You have to admit, man, this looks a little suspicious. Well, it's none of your business who gave it to me. But, I didn't steal any money. Who? All right, you know, there's only one more thing to do. We have to investigate Michael.[ The Accountants, Webisode 08 - "You're Mean" ] 00. You don't have a watch? You can't look at the clock up there? I think people should be self-sufficient. Okay, guys, let's just wait for him to leave. I can't. I have errands to run. I'm going to the mall. I need a new wok. Just stuff like that. You know, I'm not mean. I'm just demanding. I'm sorry if I was mean. Angela, Angela. Okay, let's go. It's not supposed to be fun. ...Again, sorry. What is it? Animal House. You guys are breaking my spirit.[ The Accountants, Webisode 09 - "Michael's Office" ] [Kevin blowing train whistle] Stop that. Receipts maybe. Any evidence he took the money. Or something worth $3,000. I'm gonna go on his computer. No, Kevin, I don't. If I were Michael, where would I hide a key to that drawer? In this drawer. One, two, three, six, nine. Count them. Nine snow globes with Dunder Mifflin logos on them and nothing else. And he keeps it locked. Put it back, Kevin. It's not yours. Okay, here we go. Last transaction was $23 to Jack's Joke and Magic Shop. Last eight transactions are to Jack's Joke and Magic Shop. [sighs] Paying his electric bill. No. Oh... Very well. Very well. Very well. [Kevin and Oscar pound their fists together in triumph] Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right? You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key. What? Really? She's dating? Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week? Previously on Varsity Blues... Oh, I'll be fine. No, no, I don't, but--- Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story. What do we know about this bird? You might think, "Not much. It's just a bird." But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above. g*n. The sales call! Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you. I think about that all the time. Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available. I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going? [points at picture on the wall] And that blue busty gal? What's her story? Oh, that's what they call it. I wish some of us still had our shoes on. No one's even going to notice. What does that mean? Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again. I thought maybe DJ's. I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore. No seafood. Okay, forget it. [walks away] Yes! Well, it doesn't... No thanks, guys. Have fun though. I was... Uh yeah, we'll meet you there. Thanks. Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy. Personnel Files Stamford CT Office Confidential] Can you take care of it? Oh, yes I can. Nothing. Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy. Where'd you get that salad? Hannah? Hmm. Andy? Kuhhhh... you are such a r*cist. Because you think he's black. ...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash. Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake. Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people. [laughs] That is awesome. Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But... at least we got outdoors time. Two hours, every day. Sometimes we'd play pickup football games... Ah. Well. That's not true. No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas. Umm... I don't know? Average kind? Will they still air 'Rudolph?' Hey Kev. No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock. Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three. Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela's flyer.] OK. Lots of it! [Meredith leaves to break room party.] Brownies. Cupcakes. [Kevin walks toward conference room] Try harder then. [Hannah smashes Nutcracker on top of nut. Sees Kevin take another brownie] Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some. We're going to ... What're you talking about? When you know, you just know. You don't know? Yikes. Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman--- Guh. I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister. I was definitely right. [both laugh] Oh, brother. Boobs. What? They arrived this morning. Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin? Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today. $100. Cool. Congratulations. Hey, everyone. Oh, that's very funny. Thank you. [sniffles] Nothing. I was just thinking of something else. I call shuffle. Here we go. [Spreads cards out all over the table] Thank you. Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift. At the gym. I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white. No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding. Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you? Huh? Pop quiz. Why is today a special day? In business school, Kevin. Business school. AHH! k*ll IT! k*ll IT! k*ll IIIT! AHHHH! Oh, that duck is so cute. Hey guys. Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet? Oh my God, when is it? On this side. I think I heard it on Roy's side. [tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here. Absolutely correct. Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up. Oh my God, that's a woman's suit! There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual. Negotiations are all about controlling things. About being in the driver's seat. And make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore woman's clothes. Hmm... I don't know. Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip. Oh, thank you. Please. I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly] Anybody wanna take a guess? Anybody? Anybody? Ten people, Michael. Ten people. Would you like to be one of them? No, don't worry about it. We'll just got double or nothin'. I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out. Well, that'll work. Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse. I worked in a warehouse. Men's Warehouse. I was a greeter. I'd like to see Darryl greet people. Probably make 'em feel like wimps. Not me, I... "Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Men's Warehouse. We have a special on khaki pants today." ... This is one example. Oh, don't be that person. Thank you. Kev's out. Oooh! [Jim claps] Okay, okay. You're such a ditz. Yes! I'd say like... 10,000 to 1? Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds. OK, Angela. I love your enthusiasm. All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say "Customer Service, this is Kelly!" Except don't say "Kelly," say your own name. Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name. Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation! [in accent] Absolutely! [in accent] I like ice cream! I need a boyfriend. Huh... We didn't do anything illegal. Except knock over a mailbox with her friends. Kevin, what's four plus seven? Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form. I'm sorry... that you're both morons. I called you morons. Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind? If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models. My car, my rules. No. Thank you, though. Not really. I've seen a bathroom before. I think you mean a girl'slockerroom. And in the fantasy, there's usually girls in it. Go crazy. [in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool. Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked. What are you doing in here? This is the women's room. I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall] This way to the partay bus. I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted. Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals. I'm not going to talk through the f*re after your disgusting feet have gone through. [lying in water, car lights light up his location] Hello? Who's there? My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin. Hello? I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late. Hey, Kev. Oh. Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now. You sure? Wow. Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else? Hm. Really tough call. You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got. There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks. Michael... Wha? Who gave you that advice? I would never do that. Waste of money. In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front. Then who do you think will get the job? Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper. Listen up. Let's start... from the groundup. Where does paper come from? Trees! And where do trees grow?
