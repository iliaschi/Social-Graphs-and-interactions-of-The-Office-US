Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um... [Voice raised, Indian accent] Kelly, how are you? [on video] ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of... [quietly laughing] It wasn't. I swear. Who? Dave Barry? The "Spicy Curry" award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor! Get on up here. Here you go. Um, not everything means something, it's just a joke. I don't know, it's just... I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So... We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! [Spots Kelly] Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you! Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose. Definitely Jim. Come on, Pam. Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats. "Bend It Like Beckham." [laughs] Yeah. That would be perfect. Ok. Good. Now watch, let me take you from behind. Umm... it was not that long ago. What did I say? What should we do to prepare for Y2K? Yeah, it surprised us all. I'll tell you why. Because when they--- [rips off the wrapping] Shower radio. Neat. I think this is going great. Well, it's for Angela, so .. I'll take the poster. Some people like these. I want the iPod. No. No. Definitely. It's .. [as Jim decorates a passed out Todd Packer] Oh, no. Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing? Well, this... Yeah? To throw you off the scent. Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it. I don't think so, no. I bought my veil. Ummm... Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and... You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged. So just cut me some slack. Please? As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years. One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me. So I tailed her for six straight nights. Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved. Hey, Kelly. Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk. Allergy to... the desk? Ed Truck. [exclaiming is disgust] Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, "Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us. Stop having fun. Start pretending to do work." What a jerk. He's... You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away. Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. [giggles] It was hysterical. That's what I told him. Thanks. [leaves] No, I don't think I can... Yeah, that's right. We could do a three-day weekend. I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday. Then I get a four-day weekend. Yeah. Sure. [on phone] Hey, Brenda. This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat. And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right? Um, so gimme a call back. You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one. Yikes. Uh... give me a call back, I hope. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Four and a half. Great! Uh-huh? Oh, that's part of my dream too. Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense. Excuse me? I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know. [in the background] Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about. It was. Yes. Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five. Hey Kelly. What's up? OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away] Wow. Wow. No, don't be. I bet. Yeah, yeah. Soda. [under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here. I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends. My mom. [puts card in pocket] You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't. Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight. They are unrelated. Yes. Thank you, Angela. Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date. Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married. Can you put that down there? Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh... let's go draw. I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys. Come on! [Kelly glares through the door] You have an email address? Mmhmm. What? A little fishy? Oh, okay. Um, I might have skin cancer. Kelly, you know what... No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on! [laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that's supposed to be Phyllis. I can't do it as good as he can. Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour. Illegal dr*gs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is is on the line! Now I'm going to ask you again. What time did you go home last night? Good. Hey guys, what's going on? Oh, okay. Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, "Gee, thanks, Pam."] My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes... To your HR representative. Something with animals. Or people. I got them a toaster. They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me. I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster. So now my house has got two toasters. In the Martin family, we like to say, "Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly." That's code for "check out the slut." What is... why are there flies in here? This. Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that. Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom? Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker! I don't want ketchup. [pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok. Really? I don't know. Not at work, I'll try it on--- [Pam walks out of the bathroom wearing her new red shirt] Woooooow. [smiling] It's too much. I'm gonna return it. Thanks. Attention, everybody. I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first. My old boss Ed Truck has d*ed. We don't know if it's dead. Thanks. It's okay. It's okay. [pats Kelly on shoulder] Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show. Glad you could all make it. I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day. Uh huh. Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative? Sales take a long time. I'm sure Dwight will protect him. He's not weird, he's just individualistic. Nice dress, Ryan. Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it [girly voice] it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. [normal voice] Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween. Really you do. I love the material. How come you didn't get me one? Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with. Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on. Kelly? Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday. How many gods do you have? What? They said something about Zach Braff. Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut! Stop it right now. Ryan is a temporary worker, makes no money. Wally is a whole doctor. So handsome. I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame. Oh, yeah, totally. Please? Kelly! Really? Great. What's new with you? Nope, no. Guests only. Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo. Oh right. Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing. Fruity and delicious. Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine. [everyone sighs] Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face... [Dials cell Phone] And this is Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, Kelly, it's Jim. Yes. I kind of arranged it. Kelly don't do this. You know what you're doing. Riiight. The gym. [snickers] I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding. I know but there was an emergency. Dammit, Phyllis! What do you mean? Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on. Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know. Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way. I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there. ...Wait, Ryan said that? Animals can't feel pain. Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW! It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera. It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited. Yeah. Thanks Dwight. I can't imagine what I would have done. Well that was funny, that's why. Mm-hmm. Okay. Can you stop... Guys... [sighs] Fine. I don't know what you're talking about. Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go. Alright. Don't you see why that's insane? [mouth full of pretzels] Oh, I... Then what'd he do? [Kelly's phone rings] Fat butt disease, Michael? Yeah? I bet you'd like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn't you? Dude, tell your girl to shut up. Kelly, you insulted the gentleman. Please apologize. They might think "Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael." But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun. I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da! [Dwight nods] I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money] Kelly's training us? The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job. I will do whatever it takes to survive. Like I did... when I was a homeless man. I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls. Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go? Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate? [in accent] 'ello, mate! [on phone] Excuse me? Well, I don't see how that's our fault. And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up] That's not what I had in mind. [on phone] Where are you from? Ohio? That's nice. So what do you want? [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark. [on phone] It was an unfortunate error.We're fixing it.And you already got your money back... All right. Hope nobody's on a diet. OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan? OK, it stopped. [snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool. Phyllis is out. Yes! [to Kelly] Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. [Cheers] Don't worry. You're not... No where near the big rock. OK, who's hungry [Kevin starts to put hot dog in mouth] No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. [sighs at the table] For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So sh**t for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set. The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world. Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs! Yeah. Ummm, hmm... True. Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor. God! He's a comedian. Who's Amanda Bynes? I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly. [on phone, smiling] I'm excited too. Okay. Bye. [still smiling] Nobody. You and I are done.
