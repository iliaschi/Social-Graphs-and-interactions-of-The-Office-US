So what does downsizing actually mean? Not gonna happen. It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that. Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it. Pam, information is power. Um, hi. How are you? Push it. Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. sl*very versus the Holocaust. Come on. Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai. What? In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead." Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead. Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley] Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly. There you go. I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered. Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is? It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work. And many more! OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course. Um, what do you play? Center? Uh... I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that. You're welcome. Thank you. Hmmm-hmm-hmm. Ummm-hmmm... And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling. Oh, no you di-int. W-why did you... Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks. I did. And why didn't ya Stanley? Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri. Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech [other people start joining in] Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't...[Pam starts laughing her cute drunk laugh] Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away? Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games? [sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet] 15. Okay, you know what? I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement. I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense, psychologically revealing conversations. So we're going to be playing Desert Island, umm, Who Would You Do? The Bible. Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back. The warehouse guys are a bunch of jackasses sometimes. Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here? Stanley, could you come with me, please. As Assistant Regional Manager... Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry. I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei. Well, [points at himself] busier. Making the time. This is illegal. Today is Thursday. But Dwight thinks that it's Friday. And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon. Really? God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? Sorry. No kidding. You know what the problem is? Guh. Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons. Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift. Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people. It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Yeah? Stanley! Bo banley. Banana fana fo fanley. Be my mo manley. Stanley. Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it? Maybe, I don't know. Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack. Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles. Ok, [lifts up cooked foot] what does this look like to you Stanley?! He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works. [sigh] A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here? What you mean uh hmmm... ? Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog? No it's okay, we're talking code. Alright, well, cool. [Michael walks by Jim] Still deciding? I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today. I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about. You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line. No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience. Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses. He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible. Yeah. All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it. Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check. Oh. ...that I thought you should know ... I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa] Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up] Yes, I-- Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday! The best. Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun. Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me? [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly] Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression. He does everyone in the office. dr*gs ruin lives people. dr*gs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children. Are these facts scaring you, or are they not? Do you think that smoking dr*gs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool? Someone complained that the men's room is "whites only". Stanley, you know that's not true. Stanley and I are close, too. But I didn't report your snoring- Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter. Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss. You guys want to get that beer?[ The Accountants, Webisode 04 - "Stanley" ] I'm sure it's not you, but we have to ask. We'd appreciate your cooperation if you find out who did it. No. Okay. Thanks for your help. After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I h*t bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest. I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted. I gotta win her back. You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it. Thank you Angela. Because, Dwight... never lies. What? Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham! His cappa is detated from his head! Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else. [returning ball to Stanley] Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go. All right, we're starting over. Ok. [Dwight drives away] Of course. No, I'm not going to settle down. Get in the back please. What a pair of Mary's. Come on! Bye Jim. It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby. I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans. You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie. Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide. [to Stanley] What's up with this guy? THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious! ...Oh. That's... fun for him. It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone. I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled. Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's. What d'ya think? [to Stanley about his drink] It wassogood. Oh, Hey mon! At Sandals, Jamaica, when somebody says "Hey mon," everybody says "Hey mon" back. Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too. OK, well payroll is in charge of all that. Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna... Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley. You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody. Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after? Yeah, if you don't mind. Stanley Hudson. Stanley. Hi. Thanks, so sweet. Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight? Really? Well then my man meat, he shall have. There you go. Deliciousity. So what's in the box? A toaster. BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes! I feel great, Kevin. Thank you. In a way you did. Michael! Mm-hmm, near the river. Un-shun. Never. Re-shun. I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die! It's gorgeous. Let's go! [on phone] I know, I know. We're all trying to get to the bottom of this. Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach. If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus. Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name? Then I will name your team the Red team. It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist. Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh... [slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast] [points at Stanley] Word. [Stanley starts eating hot dog] There we go. Let's see it. It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens. C'mon, Jim! Nice, Stanley! What does a great manager need most of all? Courage. Wow, very funny. Just... zip your lid! Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness. No longer. No more meetings! Soil. Right. We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil. Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head "no"] Wrong! It's nitrogen! Absorb this information. Good! Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley! When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state? Very good! You have earned one Schrute Buck. Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks! We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks? What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
