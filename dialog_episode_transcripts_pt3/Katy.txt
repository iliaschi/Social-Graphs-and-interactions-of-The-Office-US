[exhales loudly, looks out window and sees Katy] Oooh, alright I'll talk to her. Don't say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass? So uh, you know what? I usually don't allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It's yours. All day. So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here. Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks. It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here. No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the b*at of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded? [nods] [handing Katy a mug of coffee] There ya go. Nice steaming cup o'joe. I have an idea. Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right? Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that. I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here? Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby. Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O'Hara? Yeah, me too. [looks resigned] It's all gold. You're horrible. Yeah, what's that? I'm engaged. So... Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right? [to Katy] So how's that uh, coffee from earlier? Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?[Pam sheepishly hands Katy the purse and leaves] Busted. Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones. Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers. Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you! [Katy reading text message on her phone] Oh the rotating um, steam wand. [Katy looks annoyed] What? What's the matter? Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...? Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride. Seriously. No, really. God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp. I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves. What? Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o'clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home. Excellent. [laughs] Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel. [Dwight sadly looks away] Espresso? Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me. We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone. I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping. Hey, how's it going? Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private? It will just take a second. Just for a minute. Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date. Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date? Both.[Dejected, Dwight walks out slowly] Hi. I'm Jim, by the way. Hi Katy, nice to meet you. I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses. Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn. Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can... Sure you don't want me to help you with that? Cause I can grab that no problem. With us? Alright, have fun. You too, have a good night. Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter. Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay? This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay. Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it! Hey. Good, how are you? Good to see you, too. Yeah, I am too. What answers? Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on. [to everyone] Ladies and gentlemen! Gather around! We have one more participant. Come on, be polite. Be polite. [to Katy] Desert Island. Five movies. Go. Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch? Yeah? Sure. Alright. Hm? Okay. Yep. Yeah. No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything! Where did you go to school? Um, no. I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!Darryl and Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour. No, thank you. No. I don't know. Let's break up.
